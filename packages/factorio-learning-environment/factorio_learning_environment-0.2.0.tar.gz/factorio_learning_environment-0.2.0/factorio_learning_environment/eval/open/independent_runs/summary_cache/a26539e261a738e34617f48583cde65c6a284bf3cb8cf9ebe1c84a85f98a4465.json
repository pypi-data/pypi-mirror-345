{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(0.5, 0.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position 0.5, 0.5) and pipe group (position -8.5, 25.5). The steam engine is currently not connected to a power network and has no input liquid, leading to warnings about its status.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(-5.0, -65.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position -5.0, -65.0) and a stone furnace (position -5.0, -65.0). The furnace currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position(42.0, -82.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (position 42.0, -82.0) which is currently fueled with coal.\n\n### Wooden Chest at position(41.5, -83.5)\nThis chest is currently empty as it could not find wood to pick up.\n\n### Belt Group at position(40.5, -84.5)\nConsists of:\n- Input belt (position 40.5, -84.5) directing to (42.5, -84.5).\n- Output belt (position 43.5, -83.5) directing to (41.5, -83.5).\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when picking up items\n- Ensure that the item you are trying to pick up is present at the specified position before executing the pickup command.\n\n### Errors when inserting items\n- The second argument in the insert_item function must be an Entity or EntityGroup. Ensure you are passing the correct entity reference instead of a position.\n\n### Errors with coal insertion\n- Make sure you have coal in your inventory before attempting to insert it into the Burner Mining Drill.\n\n### Errors with unconnected entities\n- Ensure that your electricity generator is properly connected to a power network and has the necessary input fluids to function correctly.\n\n### Errors with furnace ingredients\n- Always check that the furnace has the required ingredients to smelt before attempting to operate it."}
