{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) which extracts iron ore and deposits it into a chest.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (x=-15.5, y=-48.5) and (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) which store extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) which transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (x=-12.0, y=-48.0) and (x=-10.0, y=-48.0) which smelt iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserters** at positions (x=-14.5, y=-47.5) and (x=-8.5, y=-47.5) which manage the transfer of materials between chests and furnaces.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (x=-7.5, y=-47.5) and (x=-6.5, y=-47.5) which store the produced iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using inserters without available items\n- Ensure that there are source items available for the inserter to pick up. This can be done by checking the inventory of the source entity before attempting to use the inserter.\n\n### Errors when inserters have no space in destination\n- Make sure that the destination entity has enough space to accommodate the items being transferred by the inserter. Regularly check and clear out destination inventories to prevent bottlenecks.\n\n### Errors when attempting to insert items not in inventory\n- Verify that the items you are trying to insert are present in your inventory. Keep track of your inventory levels and gather necessary resources before attempting to insert them into entities."}
