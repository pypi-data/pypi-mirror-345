{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Smelting Setup at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) extracting coal.\n- Stone Furnace at position (43.0, -82.0) for smelting.\n- Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -80.5) for storing coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (43.5, -80.5) transferring coal to the furnace.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Setup at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0) for smelting iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) for storing iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-14.5, -46.5) transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Crafting Due to Missing Ingredients\n- Ensure all required ingredients are available in the inventory before attempting to craft an item. For example, iron plates require a furnace for smelting, and stone is a raw resource that must be gathered.\n\n### Errors When Placing Entities Due to Inventory Shortages\n- Verify that the inventory contains the necessary entities before attempting to place them on the map. For instance, ensure wooden chests are crafted and available before placement.\n\n### Errors When Placing Entities Due to Collision\n- Check for potential collisions with existing entities or terrain when placing new entities. Adjust the spacing, direction, or reference position to avoid conflicts, such as when placing a burner inserter near a stone furnace.\n\n### Errors When Extracting or Inserting Items\n- Ensure there are items available in the inventory for insertion into entities, and verify that the target entity is not full when extracting items."}
