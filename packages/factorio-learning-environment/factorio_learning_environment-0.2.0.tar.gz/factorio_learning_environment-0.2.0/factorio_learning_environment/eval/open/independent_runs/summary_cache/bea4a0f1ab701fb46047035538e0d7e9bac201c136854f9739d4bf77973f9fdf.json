{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (40.0, -84.0) extracting resources and outputting onto a transport belt.\n- Transport Belt system operational at positions (41.5, -85.5), (41.5, -84.5), and (41.5, -83.5) connecting the mining drill to a Burner Inserter.\n- Burner Inserter at position (40.5, -82.5) transferring items from the transport belt to a Wooden Chest at position (40.5, -81.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (40.5, -81.5) storing coal with current inventory of 76 coal.\n\n### Iron Smelting Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -49.0) with a warning of 'no ingredients to smelt', indicating a need for input materials.\n- Burner Inserter at position (41.5, -80.5) waiting for source items, indicating a connection to the smelting process.\n\n### Transport Belt Network\nConsists of multiple BeltGroups and individual belts connecting various entities:\n- BeltGroup at positions (41.5, -85.5) to (41.5, -83.5) and (41.5, -80.5) to (41.5, -82.5) facilitating item movement.\n- Additional BeltGroups and belts at various positions indicating a complex network for transporting resources across the map.\n\n### Storage and Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (56.5, -83.5) and Iron Chest at position (42.5, -80.5) for storage purposes.\n- Burner Inserter at position (54.5, -83.5) and associated transport belts for item transfer.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing wooden chests\n- Ensure there is a suitable, unoccupied position before attempting to place a wooden chest. Consider clearing obstacles or choosing a different location.\n\n### Errors when connecting belts directly to chests\n- Use an inserter to input items into a Wooden Chest instead of connecting belts directly. Inserters are required to transfer items from belts to chests.\n\n### Errors when placing entities without inventory\n- Verify that the required entity, such as a Burner Inserter, is available in your inventory before attempting to place it.\n\n### Resource Management for Crafting\n- Ensure sufficient resources are available for crafting entities like Burner Inserters to avoid interruptions in production.\n\n### Warnings for blocked outputs\n- Address warnings such as 'output blocked by item on the ground' by ensuring there is a sink entity or storage available to accept outputs from mining drills or furnaces."}
