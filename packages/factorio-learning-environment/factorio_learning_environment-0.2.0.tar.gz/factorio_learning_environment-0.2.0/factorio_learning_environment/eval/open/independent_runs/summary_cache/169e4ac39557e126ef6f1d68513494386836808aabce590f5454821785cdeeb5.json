{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=20.5, y=-4.0)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (x=27.5, y=-7.5)\n- Boiler at Position (x=20.5, y=-4.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (x=19.5, y=-1.5)\n- Pipe Group connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (x=-11.0, y=20.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at Position (x=-11.5, y=18.5)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (x=20.0, y=20.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at Position (x=19.5, y=18.5)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=2.0, y=0.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n\n### Copper Cable Factory\nConsists of:\n- Assembling Machine at Position (x=10.5, y=0.5) with a shortage of copper plates\n- Inserters and Small Electric Poles connecting the assembling machine to the power grid\n- Belt Group connecting the furnace to the assembling machine\n\n### Miscellaneous Structures\n- Wooden Chests at various positions for storage\n- Multiple Inserters at various positions with some waiting for source items\n- Pipe Groups for fluid transport\n- Electricity Group providing power distribution\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Lack of Resources\n- Ensure you have the necessary resources in your inventory before attempting to insert items into entities like boilers.\n\n### Errors in Connecting Pipes\n- Verify the path and connections of pipes before attempting to connect entities. Ensure there are no obstructions or incorrect connections that might prevent successful linking.\n\n### Inserter Errors\n- Ensure that inserters have a clear path and destination to avoid waiting for source items or space in the destination. Check that there are no items blocking the inserter's operation.\n\n### Assembling Machine Resource Shortage\n- Make sure the assembling machine has the required ingredients available to avoid production halts due to missing resources."}
