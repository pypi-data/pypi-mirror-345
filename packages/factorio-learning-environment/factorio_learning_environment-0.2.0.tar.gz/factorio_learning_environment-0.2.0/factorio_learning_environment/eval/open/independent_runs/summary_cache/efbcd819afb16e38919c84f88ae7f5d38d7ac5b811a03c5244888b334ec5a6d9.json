{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, -60.0)\n  - Status: WORKING\n  - Fuel: 4 units of coal\n  - Warnings: Chest at drop position is full. Empty the chest at (4.5, -58.5) to continue mining.\n  - Drop position: (4.5, -58.5)\n  - Neighbours: Wooden chest at (5.5, -60.5) and (4.5, -58.5)\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions:\n  - (5.5, -60.5)\n  - (4.5, -58.5) with inventory containing 3 units of iron ore\n  - (7.5, -60.5)\n  - (6.5, -60.5)\n  - (9.5, -60.5)\n  - (8.5, -60.5)\n  - (-14.5, -50.5)\n\n### Iron Smelting Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-15.0, -48.0)\n  - Status: WORKING\n  - Fuel: 5 units of coal\n  - Inventory: 1 unit of iron ore, 80 units of iron plate\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-13.0, -48.0)\n  - Status: NO_INGREDIENTS\n  - Fuel: 6 units of coal\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Inventory: 67 units of iron plate\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-11.0, -48.0)\n  - Status: NO_INGREDIENTS\n  - Fuel: 7 units of coal\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Inventory: 52 units of iron plate\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Ensure Fuel Availability\n- Make sure to maintain a steady supply of coal in the inventory to refuel mining drills and furnaces to avoid interruptions in production.\n\n### Manage Chest Inventory\n- Regularly check and empty chests at drop positions to prevent mining drills from halting due to full chests.\n\n### Maintain Ingredient Supply for Furnaces\n- Ensure that furnaces have a continuous supply of ingredients (e.g., iron ore) to prevent them from running out of materials to process.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- **extract_iron_ore**: Extracts iron ore from a specified chest position.\n- **insert_into_furnace**: Inserts specified items into a furnace at a given position.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the current inventory of items such as 'wooden-chest', 'coal', 'iron-plate', and 'iron-gear-wheel'.\n- `burner_mining_drill_status`: EntityStatus - Tracks the operational status of the burner mining drill.\n- `furnace_status`: Dict[Tuple[float, float], EntityStatus] - Tracks the operational status of each furnace by position."}
