{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=-1.5, y=24.0)\nConsists of:\n- Boiler at position (x=-1.5, y=24.0)\n- Steam engine at position (x=5.5, y=21.5)\n- Offshore pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting offshore pump to boiler and boiler to steam engine:\n  - Water pipes from offshore pump to boiler: [(x=-8.5, y=23.5), (x=-9.5, y=23.5), (x=-6.5, y=23.5), ..., (x=-5.5, y=23.5), (x=-3.5, y=23.5), (x=-3.5, y=24.5)]\n  - Steam pipes from boiler to steam engine: [(x=-0.5, y=22.5), (x=-1.5, y=22.5), (x=1.5, y=22.5), ..., (x=3.5, y=24.5), (x=5.5, y=24.5), (x=4.5, y=24.5)]\n\n### Copper Plate Production at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with copper-plate production capability\n\n### Lab at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Lab with input for automation-science-pack and connected to the electricity network\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of:\n- Small electric poles connecting the steam engine to the lab\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Attribute Errors in Code\n- Ensure that all attributes accessed on objects are correctly defined and exist within the context. For example, `tile_dimensions` should be a valid attribute of the object being accessed.\n\n### Type Errors with Unsupported Operations\n- Verify that operations involving different data types are compatible. For example, ensure that you are not trying to add an integer to a non-numeric attribute.\n\n### Inventory Management Errors\n- Ensure that you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to connect entities or craft items. For example, ensure you have pipes in your inventory before attempting to connect the offshore pump to the boiler.\n\n### Connection Errors\n- Verify that all entities are correctly connected and that you have the necessary items to make connections. For example, ensure that you have small electric poles in your inventory before attempting to connect the steam engine to the lab.\n\n### Crafting Errors\n- Ensure that you have the required materials before attempting to craft items. For example, check that you have enough copper plates to craft copper cables.\n\n### Entity Placement and Extraction Errors\n- Make sure that the entities you are trying to interact with exist and are in the correct state. For example, ensure that the stone furnace contains the expected items before attempting to extract them.\n\n### Name Errors in Code\n- Ensure that all variable names are correctly defined and used consistently throughout the code. For example, verify that `copper_cable_needed_for_poles` is defined before use."}
