{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Stone brick production at position (-50.0, 0.0)\n(No changes from previous report)\n\n#### Coal mining setup at position (30.0, 0.0)\nUpdated with:\n- Wooden chest at (29.5, 1.5) (empty)\n- Blocked output persists at drill drop position (30.5, 1.5)\n- Stone furnace at (31.0, 2.0) (fuel full, no ingredients)\n\n#### Coal distribution system at position (18.5, -0.5)\n(No changes from previous report)\n\n#### Stone brick production line at position (21.0, 13.0)\n(No changes from previous report)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Persistent placement failures (steps 72-77)\n- Repeated attempts to place inserters at occupied positions (30.0,1.0) and (30.0,0.5)\n- Must:\n  - Check exact collision boxes of existing entities\n  - Implement position scanning before placement attempts\n  - Maintain updated spatial database of occupied tiles\n\n#### Connection protocol violations (step 79)\n- Attempted direct belt connection from furnace\n- Critical rule:\n  - Never connect belts directly to machines/chests\n  - Always use inserters as intermediaries\n  - Verify connection types in API documentation\n\n#### Inventory management (step 78)\n- Attempted to overfill drill fuel inventory\n- Required checks:\n  - Verify inventory capacity before insertion\n  - Implement proper inventory monitoring\n  - Handle full inventory cases gracefully\n\n#### Spatial planning improvements\n- Current issues:\n  - No clear building space around drill\n  - Overlapping entity footprints\n  - Solutions:\n    - Pre-plan 2x2 clearance around miners\n    - Implement standardized spacing templates\n    - Use ghost placement previews\n\n#### Production chain fixes\n- Immediate actions needed:\n  - Clear blocked output at (30.5,1.5)\n  - Complete inserter placement with proper spacing\n  - Verify all connection points before building\n\n#### Optimization path\n- Current state:\n  - 0 functional production chains\n  - All outputs blocked\n  - Next steps:\n    1. Fix one complete coal->furnace line\n    2. Implement material flow monitoring\n    3. Expand to parallel production"}
