{"content": "Great! You've successfully extracted 9 copper plates from the furnace. Now, let's proceed with crafting copper cables and the small electric pole, and then place the pole to provide power to the assembling machine.\n\n### Steps to Craft and Place the Small Electric Pole:\n\n1. **Craft Copper Cables:**\n   - Use the copper plates you extracted to craft copper cables. Each copper cable requires 1 copper plate.\n\n2. **Craft the Small Electric Pole:**\n   - Once you have copper cables, craft the small electric pole. This requires wood and copper cables.\n\n3. **Place the Small Electric Pole:**\n   - Position the electric pole near the assembling machine to connect it to the power network.\n\nHere's how you can execute these steps:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Craft copper cables\ncopper_cables_needed = 2  # Assuming you need 2 copper cables for a small electric pole\ncrafted_copper_cables = craft_item(Prototype.CopperCable, quantity=copper_cables_needed)\nassert crafted_copper_cables == copper_cables_needed, \"Failed to craft the required number of copper cables.\"\n\n# Step 2: Craft the small electric pole\ncrafted_poles = craft_item(Prototype.SmallElectricPole)\nassert crafted_poles > 0, \"Failed to craft the small electric pole.\"\n\n# Step 3: Place the small electric pole\npole_position = Position(x=4.5, y=2.5)  # Adjust the position as needed\nelectric_pole = place_entity(Prototype.SmallElectricPole, Direction.UP, pole_position)\nassert electric_pole, \"Failed to place the small electric pole.\"\n\nprint(\"Successfully placed the small electric pole for power connectivity.\")\n```\n\n### Tips for Success:\n\n- **Inventory Management:** Ensure you have enough materials in your inventory before crafting.\n- **Positioning:** Carefully choose the position for the electric pole to ensure it connects to the assembling machine.\n- **Check Warnings:** After placing the pole, check if the assembling machine's warnings are resolved, indicating it's connected to power.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to power the assembling machine and resolve the \"NO_POWER\" status.", "summary_range": "[1-140]"}
