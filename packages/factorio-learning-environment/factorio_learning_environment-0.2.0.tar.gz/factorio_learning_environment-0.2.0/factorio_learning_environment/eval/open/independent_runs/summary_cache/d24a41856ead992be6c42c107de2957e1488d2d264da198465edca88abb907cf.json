confirm production chains are active.\n\n\u2022 CANDIDATE POSITION VERIFICATION:\n\u2003\u2013 Revalidate candidate positions after inventory or relocation events; errors such as referencing a boiler at (x=-5.5, y=24.0) after pick\u2010up highlight the need for updated position tracking.\n\u2003\u2013 Routine candidate function checks near key structures are critical to avoid repeated placement failures.\n\n\u2022 BOILER & OFFSHORE PUMP RELOCATION ERRORS:\n\u2003\u2013 Multiple relocation attempts for the boiler and offshore pump (candidate positions at (x=1.5, y=28.0), (x=20.0, y=20.0) and (x=29.5, y=28.0)/(x=29.0, y=28.5)) failed buildability checks; preselect open, unobstructed regions and clear nearby congestion before relocation.\n\u2003\u2013 Update entity status immediately after pick-up events to avoid retrieval errors and referencing outdated positions."}
