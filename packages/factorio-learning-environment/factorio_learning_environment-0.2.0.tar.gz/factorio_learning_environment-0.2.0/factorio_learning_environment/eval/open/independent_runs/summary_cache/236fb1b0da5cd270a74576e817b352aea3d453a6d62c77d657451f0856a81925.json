{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nCurrently, there are no structures built on the map. The logs indicate attempts to place various entities, but none have been successfully established. The inventory contains items that could be used to create structures, but no entities are present on the map as of the latest logs.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when attempting to place entities on non-buildable tiles\n- Ensure that the target tile is buildable before attempting to place an entity. This can be checked by verifying the buildability of the position beforehand.\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied or restricted tiles\n- Check if the tile is already occupied or has restrictions before placing an entity. Attempting to place an entity on such tiles will result in failure.\n\n### Errors due to lack of resources for operation\n- Make sure that the necessary resources, such as coal for furnaces, are available and supplied to the entities to ensure their operation.\n\n### General placement errors\n- Verify the environment settings and ensure that the positions selected for placing entities are suitable and free from global build restrictions."}
