{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Extraction and Storage at Position (x=52.5, y=-84.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=53.0, y=-83.0) extracting coal\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=52.5, y=-84.5) storing extracted coal\n\n### Iron Ore Extraction and Processing at Position (x=-14.5, y=-54.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0) extracting iron ore\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-54.5) storing extracted iron ore\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-23.0, y=-66.0) processing iron ore into iron plates\n\n### Copper and Iron Ore Processing with Belt Transport System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-25.0, y=-64.0) extracting copper ore and iron ore\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-23.0, y=-66.0) processing ores\n- Belt Group at positions (x=-26.5, y=-65.5) to (x=-22.5, y=-64.5) transporting ores to the furnace\n\n### Idle Furnace at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) currently not processing due to lack of ingredients\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Idle Furnace\n- Ensure that the furnace has the necessary ingredients to process. Check the inventory and supply the required resources to avoid idle status.\n\n### Efficient Resource Management\n- Regularly check the inventory of chests and furnaces to ensure they are not overfilled or under-supplied, which can lead to inefficiencies in production.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
