{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at Position(-15.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -49.0) which is currently working, processing iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position(40.0, -84.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (40.0, -84.0) extracting coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (40.5, -82.5) storing extracted coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -83.5) with no inventory.\n- Burner Inserter at position (41.5, -80.5) waiting for source items.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Iron Chest at position (0.5, 0.5) containing iron plates.\n- Iron Chest at position (1.5, 0.5) currently empty.\n\n### Item Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Inserter at position (54.5, -83.5) ready to transfer items from the chest at position (56.5, -83.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (56.5, -83.5) containing iron plates.\n\n### Belt System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- BeltGroup connecting various positions, facilitating coal transport.\n- Belts positioned at (x=50.5 y=-86.5) to (x=48.5 y=-86.5) and (x=49.5 y=-86.5) to (x=47.5 y=-86.5) with coal inventory.\n- Additional belts at positions (x=43.5 y=-84.5) to (x=45.5 y=-84.5), (x=45.5 y=-85.5) to (x=47.5 y=-85.5), and (x=52.5 y=-83.5) to (x=52.5 y=-85.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when crafting items\n- Ensure that the crafting function is correctly implemented and does not attempt to concatenate a nil value. Double-check the crafting logic and error handling to prevent this issue.\n\n### Errors when extracting items\n- Make sure the target entity (e.g., chest) has enough items to extract. Verify the inventory before attempting extraction to avoid exceptions.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
