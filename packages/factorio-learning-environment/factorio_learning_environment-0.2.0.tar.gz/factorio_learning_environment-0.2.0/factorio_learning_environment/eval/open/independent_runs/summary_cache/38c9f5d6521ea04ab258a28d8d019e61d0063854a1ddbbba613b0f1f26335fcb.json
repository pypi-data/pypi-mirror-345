{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (5.5, 21.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (5.5, 21.5)\n- Boiler (position not specified)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe network connecting these components, including pipes at positions such as (5.5, 18.5), (7.5, 19.5), and others forming a complex pipe group.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Multiple Stone Furnaces at positions (0.0, 0.0), (10.0, 0.0), (13.0, 0.0), and (16.0, 0.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserters at positions (8.5, 0.5), (17.5, 0.5), (19.5, 0.5), and (20.5, 0.5) for transferring materials between chests and furnaces.\n- Wooden Chests at positions (8.5, -0.5), (17.5, -0.5), (19.5, -0.5), and (20.5, -0.5) for storing raw materials and finished products.\n\n### Lab at Position (Not Specified)\nConsists of:\n- Lab with automation science packs input and connected to a power source, but no research in progress.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities on Occupied Tiles\n- Ensure you can place an entity on a tile before attempting to place it. Remove any existing entities from the target position if necessary.\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities Too Far\n- Move closer to the target position before attempting to place an entity. Ensure the distance is within the maximum allowable range.\n\n### Research Initiation Failures\n- Verify that all prerequisites for the research are met and that the lab has sufficient science packs before initiating research.\n\n### Steam Engine Connection Issues\n- Ensure all components of the electricity generation system are correctly connected and that there are no missing or misplaced pipes. Investigate and resolve any issues preventing the steam engine from working.\n\n### API Usage Errors\n- Ensure that all API calls are correctly defined and that all necessary entities are available at specified positions."}
