{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line at (x=1-3, y=1-3.5)\nConsists of:\n- Two stone furnaces at (x=1.0, y=1.0) and (x=3.0, y=1.0)\n- Two burner inserters at (x=1.5, y=2.5) and (x=3.5, y=2.5)\n- Two wooden chests at (x=1.5, y=3.5) and (x=3.5, y=3.5) storing iron plates\n- Additional wooden chest and burner inserter setup at (x=5.5, y=2.5-3.5)\n\n### Copper Plate Production Line at (x=2-4, y=7-9.5)\nConsists of:\n- Two stone furnaces at (x=2.0, y=7.0) and (x=4.0, y=7.0)\n- Two burner inserters at (x=2.5, y=8.5) and (x=4.5, y=8.5)\n- Two wooden chests at (x=2.5, y=9.5) and (x=4.5, y=9.5) storing copper plates\n\n### Power Generation System (x=-5.5 to x=13.5, y=26.5-35.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at (x=2.5, y=35.5) extracting water\n- Boiler at (x=7.0, y=35.5) converting water to steam\n- Steam engine at (x=13.5, y=35.5) generating electricity\n- Two pipe groups:\n  - Water pipes (system 1543) connecting pump to boiler\n  - Steam pipes (system 1546) connecting boiler to steam engine\n- Electricity distribution network with multiple small electric poles\n- Additional disconnected offshore pump at (x=-5.5, y=26.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Fluid System Connection Issues\n- Ensure offshore pumps are properly connected to the fluid system - one pump is currently disconnected and showing \"No fluid present in connections\" warning\n\n### Furnace Operation Issues\n- Monitor furnace fuel levels and ingredient supply to prevent \"no ingredients to smelt\" warnings\n- Consider implementing a more consistent refueling system for furnaces\n\n### Resource Management\n- Some furnaces are showing \"furnace fuel source is full\" warnings - implement a more efficient fuel distribution system to prevent overfilling"}
