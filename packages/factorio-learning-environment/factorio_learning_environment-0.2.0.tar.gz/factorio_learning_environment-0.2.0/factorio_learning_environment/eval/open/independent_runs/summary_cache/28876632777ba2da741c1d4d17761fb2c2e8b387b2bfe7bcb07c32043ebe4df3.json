{"content": "# Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-13.5, 23.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (-13.5, 23.5) - Status: NOT_CONNECTED\n- Boiler at position (-10.5, 21.0) - Status: NOT_CONNECTED\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5) - Status: WORKING\n- Various pipe groups connecting the components, with positions including (-9.5, 22.5), (-9.5, 23.5), (-10.5, 23.5), and others, some of which are EMPTY, FULL_OUTPUT, or NOT CONNECTED.\n\n### Stone Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Status: NO_INGREDIENTS\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Pipes\n- Ensure there is no existing object in the way before placing pipes or pipe-to-ground. Check the target location for obstructions.\n- Verify that the inventory contains the required pipes before attempting to place them.\n\n### Errors in Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure that the pipes are correctly aligned and positioned to connect to each other. Check the coordinates and alignment of pipe-to-ground entities to ensure connectivity.\n\n### Errors with Entity Status\n- Connect steam engines and boilers to the appropriate network to change their status from NOT_CONNECTED to operational.\n- Ensure that the electricity network is properly connected to avoid the NOT_PLUGGED_IN_ELECTRIC_NETWORK status.\n\n### API Usage Errors\n- Avoid using objects or functions incorrectly, such as treating a 'Position' object as callable. Check the API documentation for correct usage patterns."}
