For example, ensure a Stone Furnace or Wooden Chest is present at the target coordinates.\n\n### Errors in API usage\n- When using API functions like `pickup_entity`, ensure all arguments are correctly specified and valid. For instance, avoid using unexpected keyword arguments such as 'quantity' in `pickup_entity`.\n\n### Errors in item insertion\n- When inserting items into entities, ensure the correct data types are used. For example, avoid passing a boolean where a number is expected, as seen in the `insert_item` function."}
