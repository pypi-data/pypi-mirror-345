{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-16.0, -51.0) which is currently working and extracting iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) which is successfully producing iron plates. The furnace is fueled with coal and has a source inventory containing iron ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to insufficient inventory\n- Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to place entities. For example, the attempt to place a burner mining drill failed due to the absence of the drill in the inventory.\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied or invalid locations\n- Before placing an entity, verify that the desired location is unoccupied and suitable for the entity. This will prevent errors such as \"Cannot place Wooden Chest at the desired location\" and similar errors for transport belts and burner inserters.\n\n### Errors in furnace setup\n- Double-check the setup of your furnace to ensure it is correctly configured and supplied with the necessary resources. This will help avoid issues where the furnace is not producing iron plates as expected."}
