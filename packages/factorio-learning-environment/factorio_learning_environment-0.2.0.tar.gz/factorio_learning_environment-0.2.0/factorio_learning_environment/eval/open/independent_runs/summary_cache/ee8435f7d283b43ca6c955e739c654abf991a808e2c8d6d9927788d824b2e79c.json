{"content": "# Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=5.5, y=21.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam engine at position (x=5.5, y=21.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=-1.5, y=24.0)\n- Offshore pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\n- Connected by a series of pipes and pipe-to-ground components, including:\n  - PipeGroup with water at position (x=-9.5, y=23.5)\n  - PipeGroup with steam at position (x=-1.5, y=22.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\n- Furnace at position (x=10.0, y=0.0)\n- Furnace at position (x=13.0, y=0.0)\n- Furnace at position (x=16.0, y=0.0)\n- Each furnace is supplied with coal and iron ore and outputs iron plates\n\n### Inserter and Chest Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chests at positions (x=17.5, y=-0.5), (x=19.5, y=-0.5), and (x=20.5, y=-0.5)\n- Burner inserters at positions (x=8.5, y=0.5), (x=17.5, y=0.5), (x=19.5, y=0.5), and (x=20.5, y=0.5)\n- Inserters are configured to transfer items between furnaces and chests\n\n### Research Lab\n- Lab at position with no research in progress, connected to the electricity network\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using isinstance with incorrect types\n- Ensure that the object being checked with isinstance is not a list when expecting a specific entity type like Furnace or Chest.\n\n### Errors due to undefined names\n- Verify that all entity names used in code are correctly defined and imported. Use the correct entity class such as entities.Furnace instead of just Furnace.\n\n### Errors when connecting pipes\n- Ensure that all entities involved in pipe connections are correctly positioned and the correct pipe types are used for connections.\n\n### Errors when placing entities too far\n- Move closer to the target position before attempting to place an entity. The maximum placement distance is 10 units.\n\n### Errors when initiating research\n- Ensure that the research prerequisites are met and the lab is properly configured with the necessary science packs.\n\n### Inserter Configuration Errors\n- Check that inserters have a valid source and destination configuration to ensure they can transfer items correctly."}
