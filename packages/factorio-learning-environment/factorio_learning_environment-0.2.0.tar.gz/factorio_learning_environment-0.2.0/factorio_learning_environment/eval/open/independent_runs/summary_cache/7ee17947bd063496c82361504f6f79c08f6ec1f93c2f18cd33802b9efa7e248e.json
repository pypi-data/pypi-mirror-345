{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnaces**: \n  - Stone furnace at position (x=-15.0, y=-48.0) with a current inventory of 11 iron plates.\n  - Stone furnace at position (x=-13.0, y=-48.0) with a current inventory of 5 iron plates.\n  - Stone furnace at position (x=-11.0, y=-48.0) with a current inventory of 2 iron plates.\n- **Chests**:\n  - Multiple wooden chests positioned at (x=-14.5, y=-50.5) to (x=-6.5, y=-50.5) for storing iron plates, with some chests full and others partially filled.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill**:\n  - Positioned at (x=4.0, y=-60.0), extracting iron ore and depositing it into a chest at (x=4.5, y=-58.5).\n- **Chests**:\n  - A wooden chest at (x=4.5, y=-58.5) which is full and needs emptying to continue mining operations.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Full Chests\n- Ensure that chests used for storing extracted resources are regularly emptied to prevent mining operations from halting. The chest at (x=4.5, y=-58.5) is full, causing the mining drill to stop.\n\n### Errors Due to No Ingredients in Furnaces\n- Regularly check and refill furnaces with the necessary ingredients to maintain continuous production. Furnaces at positions (x=-15.0, y=-48.0), (x=-13.0, y=-48.0), and (x=-11.0, y=-48.0) have warnings of \"no ingredients to smelt.\"\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the given steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `iron_ore_inventory`: int, current count of iron ore in inventory.\n- `iron_plate_inventory`: int, current count of iron plates in inventory.\n- `iron_gear_wheel_inventory`: int, current count of iron gear wheels in inventory.\n- `wood_inventory`: int, current count of wood in inventory."}
