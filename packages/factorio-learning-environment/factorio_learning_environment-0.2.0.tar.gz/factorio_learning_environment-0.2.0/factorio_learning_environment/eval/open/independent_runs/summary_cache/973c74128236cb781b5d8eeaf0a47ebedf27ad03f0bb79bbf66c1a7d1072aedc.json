{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -80.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnaces at positions (0.0, 0.0), (10.0, 0.0), (13.0, 0.0), and (16.0, 0.0).\n- Burner Inserters at positions (8.5, 0.5), (17.5, 0.5), (19.5, 0.5), and (20.5, 0.5) facilitating material transfer.\n- Wooden Chests at positions (8.5, -0.5), (8.5, 1.5), (17.5, -0.5), (17.5, 1.5), (19.5, -0.5), (19.5, 1.5), (20.5, -0.5).\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-0.5, 17.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (-0.5, 17.5).\n- Boiler at position (-3.5, 22.0).\n- Offshore Pump at position (-7.5, 25.5).\n- Pipe Group connecting these entities, including positions (-2.5, 20.5), (-3.5, 20.5), (-0.5, 20.5), and (-1.5, 20.5).\n\n### Research Lab\n- Lab at an unspecified position with no research in progress.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting pipes\n- Ensure that the pipes are correctly aligned and that there is a clear path between the boiler and the steam engine. Verify that the connection points are not obstructed and that the pipes are placed correctly.\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities\n- Double-check the position and type of the entity you are trying to retrieve. Ensure that the entity exists at the specified position before attempting to interact with it.\n\n### Inserter waiting for source items\n- Make sure that the source chest or entity has the necessary items for the inserter to function. Regularly check and replenish the source inventory to prevent bottlenecks.\n\n### Boiler out of fuel\n- Regularly refuel the boiler to ensure continuous operation. Monitor fuel levels and automate refueling if possible to avoid interruptions.\n\n### Steam engine not connected\n- Verify that the steam engine is properly connected to the boiler and that there is a continuous flow of steam. Check for any missing or misplaced pipes in the connection."}
