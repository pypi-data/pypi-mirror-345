{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Operation at (15.5, 70.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill at (15.5, 70.5) extracting iron ore\n- Currently disconnected from power network (status: NO_POWER)\n\n### Power Generation Plant at (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, -0.5) extracting water\n- Boiler at (-5.5, 0.0) currently out of fuel\n- Steam engine at (-0.5, 0.5) not connected\n- Partial pipe network:\n  - Pipe at (-8.5, -0.5)\n  - Pipe at (-7.5, -0.5)\n- Currently non-functional due to:\n  - Broken water pipe connections\n  - Boiler fuel depletion\n\n### New Smelting Setup at (25.0, 79.0)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill at (25.5, 75.5)\n- Stone furnace at (25.0, 79.0)\n- Input burner inserter at (25.5, 77.5)\n- Output wooden chest at (27.5, 79.5)\n- Output burner inserter at (26.5, 79.5)\n- Currently non-functional due to power issues\n\n### Secondary Smelting Setup at (20.0, 73.0)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill at (20.5, 70.5)\n- Stone furnace at (20.0, 73.0)\n- Output wooden chest at (22.5, 73.5)\n- Missing input inserter configuration\n\n### New Mining Operation at (20.5, 20.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill at (20.5, 20.5)\n- Currently unconnected to any processing chain\n\n### New Furnace Setup at (20.0, 20.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace at (20.0, 20.0) with 19 coal\n- Wooden chest at (21.5, 20.5)\n- Currently idle due to missing input materials\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Persistent Water Placement Issues\n- Multiple failed attempts to place entities in water (steps 32,35,39)\n- Critical solution: \n  - Implement terrain validation before placement\n  - Use debug tools to check tile types\n  - Avoid building near water edges without proper checks\n\n### Fluid System Connection Failures\n- Repeated pipe connection failures (steps 37,38)\n- Required checks:\n  - Verify clear path between connection points\n  - Ensure proper pipe alignment\n  - Check for existing obstructions in pipe path\n\n### Resource Location Assumptions\n- Multiple failed iron ore checks at (0,0) (steps 33,34)\n- Always:\n  - Verify resource existence before attempting access\n  - Use proper scanning patterns for resource discovery\n  - Store valid resource locations for reuse\n\n### Power System Degradation\n- Complete power plant failure (step 36)\n- Critical maintenance:\n  1. Monitor boiler fuel levels\n  2. Verify all pipe connections\n  3. Check steam engine input connections\n  4. Maintain backup fuel supplies\n\n### Entity Collision Problems\n- Continuing placement failures due to existing objects (step 39)\n- Always:\n  - Scan target area before placement\n  - Maintain clearance buffers\n  - Implement collision detection routines\n\n### Production Chain Verification\n- Multiple non-functional production chains\n- Always verify:\n  1. Power supply to all electric devices\n  2. Fuel in all burner devices\n  3. Correct inserter alignment\n  4. Material flow through entire chain\n\n### Boiler Fuel Issues\n- Boiler warnings about being out of fuel\n- Implement regular fuel checks for burner devices\n- Consider automated fuel delivery systems\n\n### Entity Spacing Problems\n- Continuing placement failures due to insufficient space\n- Critical spacing rules:\n  - Minimum 0.5 tile clearance around all entities\n  - Larger machines need 1+ tile buffers\n  - Plan layouts with adequate spacing before placement"}
