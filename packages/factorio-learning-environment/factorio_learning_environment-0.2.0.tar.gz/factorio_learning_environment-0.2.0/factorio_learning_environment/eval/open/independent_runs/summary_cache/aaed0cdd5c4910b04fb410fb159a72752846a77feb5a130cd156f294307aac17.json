{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) storing extracted iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-9.0, -48.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -47.5) for additional storage.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-14.5, -46.5) transferring items between entities.\n\n### Coal Supply Facility at Position (41.5, -80.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) extracting coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -80.5) storing extracted coal.\n- Stone Furnace at position (43.0, -82.0) using coal as fuel.\n- Burner Inserter at position (43.5, -80.5) transferring items between entities.\n- Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -79.5) for additional storage.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities with insufficient space\n- Ensure there is enough space and no collisions with existing entities when placing new structures. Consider increasing the spacing or changing the direction or reference position to avoid placement errors.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient inventory items\n- Verify that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities. This will prevent errors related to missing inventory items.\n\n### Inserter waiting for source items\n- Ensure that the source entity has items available for the inserter to transfer. This can be achieved by maintaining a steady supply of resources to the source entity."}
