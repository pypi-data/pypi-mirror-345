{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Fuel: Coal\n  - Neighbours: Wooden Chest at (x=-14.5, y=-48.5), Burner Inserter at (x=-13.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Resources: Iron ore\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Inventory: 465 units of iron ore\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Status: Waiting for source items\n  - Fuel: Coal\n  - Neighbours: Wooden Chest at (x=-14.5, y=-48.5), Burner Mining Drill at (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\n  - Status: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Fuel: Coal\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Inserter Setup\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items from the source (chest) to the destination (furnace). Regularly check the inserter setup to prevent interruptions in the production line.\n\n### Errors when Refueling with Insufficient Inventory\n- Before attempting to refuel any entity, verify that you have the necessary fuel in your inventory. This can be done by checking your inventory levels and ensuring you have enough coal or other fuel types available.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Iron Ore\n- Check the inserter setup and ensure that the inserter is correctly transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace. Verify that the inserter is powered and has the correct pickup and drop positions set."}
