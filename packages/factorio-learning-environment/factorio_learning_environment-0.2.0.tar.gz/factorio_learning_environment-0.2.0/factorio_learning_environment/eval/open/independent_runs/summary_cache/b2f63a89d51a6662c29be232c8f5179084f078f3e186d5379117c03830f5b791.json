{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-15.0, -49.0) used for smelting iron ore into iron plates. Current status indicates no ingredients to smelt, with 6 units of coal as fuel and 86 iron plates in the result inventory.\n\n### Coal Mining and Transport System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (42.0, -83.0) extracting coal. The drill is operational but has a warning indicating its output is blocked by an item on the ground, with no sink entity to accept the output.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (42.5, -81.5) transferring items from the mining drill. It is currently waiting for source items, with a warning that the chest is full.\n- **Belt Group** consisting of:\n  - Belts running from (42.5, -82.5) to (44.5, -82.5) in the right direction.\n  - Belts running from (43.5, -81.5) to (43.5, -79.5) in the down direction.\n  - Belts running from (43.5, -80.5) to (42.5, -79.5) in the left direction.\n  - The belt system is currently empty and consists of 7 belts in total.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Wooden Chests\n- Ensure that the intended position for placing a wooden chest is clear and not obstructed by other entities or terrain. This will prevent placement errors.\n\n### Errors when Placing Inserters\n- Verify that the intended position for placing an inserter is valid and not occupied by another entity. This will help in avoiding placement issues.\n\n### Output Blockage in Mining Drills\n- Address the warning of output blockage by ensuring there is a sink entity (such as a chest or belt) to accept the output from the mining drill. This will prevent the drill from being blocked and improve efficiency.\n\n### Furnace Lacking Ingredients\n- Ensure that the stone furnace has a continuous supply of ingredients (iron ore) to maintain production. This will prevent the furnace from idling due to a lack of ingredients."}
