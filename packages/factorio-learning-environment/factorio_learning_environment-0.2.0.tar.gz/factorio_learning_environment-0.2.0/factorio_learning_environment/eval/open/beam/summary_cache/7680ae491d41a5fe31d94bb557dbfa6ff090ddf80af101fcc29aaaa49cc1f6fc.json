{"content": "Ah, now I understand the core issue. We need to move closer to where we want to place the furnace because there's a maximum placement distance of 10 units from the player's position. Here's the corrected code:\n\n```python\n# First check our inventory\ninventory = inspect_inventory()\nprint(f\"Current inventory: {inventory}\")\n\n# Find iron ore patch\niron_pos = nearest(Resource.IronOre)\nprint(f\"Found iron ore at {iron_pos}\")\n\n# Move to iron ore location and harvest some\nmove_to(iron_pos)\nharvest_resource(iron_pos, quantity=10)\nprint(\"Harvested iron ore\")\n\n# Stay where we are and place the furnace nearby (we're already at iron_pos)\ncurrent_pos = iron_pos\nfurnace_pos = Position(x=current_pos.x + 2, y=current_pos.y)\nmove_to(furnace_pos)  # Move to where we want to place the furnace\nfurnace = place_entity(Prototype.StoneFurnace, position=furnace_pos)\nprint(f\"Placed furnace at {furnace.position}\")\n\n# Add fuel to furnace\ninsert_item(Prototype.Coal, furnace, quantity=5)\nprint(\"Added fuel to furnace\")\n\n# Add iron ore to furnace\ninventory = inspect_inventory()\nif Prototype.IronOre in inventory:\n    insert_item(Prototype.IronOre, furnace, quantity=10)\n    print(\"Added iron ore to furnace\")\n\n# Wait for smelting\nprint(\"Waiting for smelting...\")\nsleep(5)\n\n# Check furnace contents\nfurnace_contents = inspect_inventory(furnace)\nprint(f\"Furnace contents: {furnace_contents}\")\n\n# Extract the iron plates\nif Prototype.IronPlate in furnace_contents:\n    extract_item(Prototype.IronPlate, furnace.position, quantity=furnace_contents[Prototype.IronPlate])\n    print(\"Extracted iron plates from furnace\")\n\n# Check our updated inventory\nnew_inventory = inspect_inventory()\nprint(f\"Updated inventory: {new_inventory}\")\n```\n\nKey changes made:\n1. Added a move_to() command before placing the furnace to ensure we're within range\n2. Stored our current position after moving to the iron ore\n3. Calculated the furnace position relative to where we are\n4. Made sure we're close enough before trying to place the furnace\n\nThis should resolve the \"too far away\" error we were getting. The maximum placement distance is 10 units, so we need to make sure we're within that range when placing entities.", "summary_range": "[1-2218]"}
