"""
This script generates a quarterly employee report by querying JIRA for issues assigned to the current user.
It includes a main function, `cli_quarterly_connection`, which retrieves JIRA issues from the last 90 days,
processes the information, and handles exceptions related to JIRA searches.

Functions:
- `cli_quarterly_connection`: Constructs a quarterly report by querying JIRA for issues created, resolved, updated,
or commented on by the current user within the last 90 days.

Arguments:
- `jira`: An instance of `JiraClient` for accessing JIRA issues.

Exceptions:
- Raises `QuarterlyConnectionError` if there are issues with the JIRA search operation.

Side Effects:
- Outputs "Building employee report" to the console and prints the summarized report.

Note:
- The function filters out issues related to CVEs and prints relevant summaries to the console.
