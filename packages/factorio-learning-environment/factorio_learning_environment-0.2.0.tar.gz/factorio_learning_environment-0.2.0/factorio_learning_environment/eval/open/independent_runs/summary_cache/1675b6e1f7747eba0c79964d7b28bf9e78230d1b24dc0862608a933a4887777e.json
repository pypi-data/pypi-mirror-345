Use an intermediary inserter to feed items properly.\n\n\u2022 Belt Connection Path Configuration:\n  - Ensure intermediate waypoints create an axis-aligned, monotonic path. Adjust offsets and alignment to prevent \u201cNot a valid path to normalise\u201d errors.\n\n\u2022 Inventory and Placement Verification:\n  - Confirm required items (e.g., wooden chests) are present in the inventory and that target positions are buildable. This avoids errors such as \u201cNo wooden_chest in inventory\u201d and TypeErrors arising from treating Position objects as callable.\n\n\u2022 Entity Retrieval Accuracy:\n  - When invoking functions like get_entity, verify that the target entity exists at the specified coordinates to avoid retrieval failures.\n\n\u2022 Consistent Connection Strategy:\n  - Regularly review both the target entity types and surrounding structure placements. Shifting source positions and reconfiguring intermediary waypoints can help mitigate conflicts and ensure proper belt placement."}
