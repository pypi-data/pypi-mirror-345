{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) extracting iron ore and depositing into a Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -54.5).\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) fueled with coal, currently inactive due to lack of ingredients.\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) extracting coal and depositing into a Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5).\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-25.0, -64.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-25.0, -64.0) extracting copper ore and depositing onto a Belt Group.\n- Belt Group transporting copper ore from position (-26.5, -65.5) to position (-22.5, -65.5).\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -65.0) fueled with coal, currently inactive due to lack of ingredients.\n\n### Item Transfer and Storage System at Position (2.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) transferring items from a Wooden Chest at position (3.5, 0.5) to another Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Inserters\n- Ensure that inserters are placed correctly to interact with the intended source and destination entities. Verify the direction and position before placement to avoid incorrect placements.\n\n### Errors when Fueling Entities\n- Always check the fuel status of entities such as burner mining drills and furnaces. Ensure they are adequately fueled to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Errors due to Lack of Ingredients in Furnaces\n- Monitor the input inventory of furnaces to ensure they have the necessary ingredients for smelting. Regularly supply the required ores to prevent inactivity.\n\n### Errors when Inserters are Waiting for Source Items\n- Verify that the source entity for inserters contains items to be transferred. Ensure continuous supply to the source entity to avoid idle inserters."}
