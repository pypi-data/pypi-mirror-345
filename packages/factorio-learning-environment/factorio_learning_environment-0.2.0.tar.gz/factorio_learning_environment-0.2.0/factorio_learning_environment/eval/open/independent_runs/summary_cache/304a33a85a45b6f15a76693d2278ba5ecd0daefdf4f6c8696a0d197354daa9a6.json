Always interpose an inserter to serve as the belt\u2019s input so that transport belts are never connected to a Prototype.SteamEngine entity.\n\u2013 When placing a wooden chest, ensure the target tile is within the allowed placement range. Move closer to the target location to avoid \u201ctarget position is too far away\u201d errors.\n\u2013 Before attempting placement, confirm that the required entity is available in the inventory to avoid \u201cNo \u2026 in inventory\u201d errors.\n\u2013 Verify variable names and references (for example, use the correctly defined target variable instead of an undefined identifier) to prevent NameErrors."}
