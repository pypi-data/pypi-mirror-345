{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n###Iron Plate Production Line at (-73.0)\nConsists of two stone furnaces for smelting iron ore:\n- First stone furnace at position (3.0, -73.0)\n- Second stone furnace at position (5.0, -73.0)\nBoth furnaces are operational with coal as fuel but currently have no ingredients to smelt\n- First furnace: 27 coal units as fuel\n- Second furnace: 23 coal units as fuel\n\n###Copper Mining and Smelting Setup at (-73.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill positioned at (-21.0, -73.0) targeting copper ore deposit\n- Stone furnace at (-19.0, -74.0)\n- Iron chest at (-21.5, -74.5) to collect copper ore from drill\n- Burner inserter at (-20.5, -74.5) moving items from chest to furnace\nCurrent status:\n- Mining drill is out of fuel\n- Furnace has 7 coal units as fuel and 63 copper plates\n- Inserter has 17 coal units as fuel\n\n###Iron Mining and Smelting Setup at (-76.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill positioned at (-2.0, -76.0) targeting iron ore deposit (facing DOWN)\n- Iron chest at (-1.5, -74.5) to collect iron ore from drill\n- Stone furnace at (0.0, -77.0)\n- Burner inserter at (-1.5, -73.5) to move iron ore from chest to furnace\nCurrent status:\n- Mining drill has 31 coal units as fuel\n- Furnace has 50 coal units as fuel\n- Chest contains 48 iron ore\n- Inserter has 19 coal units as fuel\n- System is operational but inserter is blocked due to incorrect drop position\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n###Entity Placement Spacing Issues\n- When placing a furnace near a mining drill, ensure there is adequate clear space at the drop position\n- Check if the target location for furnace placement is actually empty and accessible\n- Consider the tile dimensions of both the mining drill (2x2) and furnace (2x2) when planning placement\n\n###Inventory Management\n- Always check inventory before attempting to insert items\n- Ensure you have the required items (like coal) before attempting insertion operations\n- Verify you have the necessary items in inventory before attempting to use them in any operation\n\n###Inserter Setup Issues\n- Ensure inserter drop position aligns with the input tile of target furnace\n- Current issue: Inserter at (-1.5, -73.5) is dropping items at (-1.5, -72.5) while furnace is at (0.0, -77.0)\n- When repositioning inserters, clean up misplaced ones before placing new ones\n- Verify the drop position matches the actual input location of the target entity\n\n###Output Blocking Issues\n- Monitor furnace output capacity and collect products regularly to prevent blocking\n- Ensure there is a proper output collection system in place when setting up automated production lines\n- Set up additional storage or transport systems when furnace output is likely to fill up\n\n###Mining Drill Output Issues\n- When setting up mining drills, ensure there is a proper output collection system\n- If there's no sink entity to accept output, items will block on the ground\n- Verify the mining drill's drop position connects properly to the intended destination\n\n###Low Fuel Monitoring\n- Monitor fuel levels in mining drills and inserters regularly\n- Replenish fuel before it runs out (copper mining drill is currently out of fuel)\n- Maintain adequate fuel levels in all powered entities to ensure continuous operation"}
