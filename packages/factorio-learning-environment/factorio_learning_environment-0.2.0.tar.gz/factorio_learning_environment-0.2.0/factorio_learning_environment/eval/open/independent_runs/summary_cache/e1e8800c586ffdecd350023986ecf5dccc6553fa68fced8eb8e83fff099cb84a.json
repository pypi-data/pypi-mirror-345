{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-29.5, 30.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position -29.5, 30.5) and boiler (position -24.5, -50.0) connected by pipes (positions -24.5, -51.5 and -23.5, -51.5). The steam engine is currently not generating power due to connection issues.\n\n### Offshore pump at position(-10.5, 25.5)\nConsists of an offshore pump (position -10.5, 25.5) which is operational and connected to a pipe network.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(-18.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position -18.0, -49.0) and a furnace (position -18.0, -49.0)\n\n### Lab at position(-10.5, -10.5)\nCurrently, there is no lab present at the expected position. A new lab needs to be placed.\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine (position unknown) and inserter that puts into the assembling machine (position unknown).\n\n### Copper plate factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace (position -18.0, -49.0) that produces copper plates.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting steam engine to boiler\n- Ensure that the pipes are correctly placed and connected between the steam engine and boiler. Check the positions of pipes and ensure they are not obstructed.\n\n### Errors when placing lab\n- A lab was expected at position (-10.5, -10.5) but was not found. Ensure that the lab is placed at the correct position before attempting to access it.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
