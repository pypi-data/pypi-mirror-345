{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Oil Extraction System at (17.5, 40.5)\nConsists of:\n- Pumpjack at (17.5, 40.5) - now has small electric pole at (19.5,40.5) but still lacks power\n- Pipe network connecting pumpjack (positions: (19.5,38.5), (18.5,38.5), (21.5,38.5), (20.5,38.5))\n\n### Operational Power Plant at (-8.5, 20.0)\nConsists of:\n- Boiler at (-8.5, 20.0) - operational with 39 coal and connected water system\n- Offshore pump at (-11.5, 21.5) - actively supplying water\n- Pipe network (positions: (-6.5,21.5), (-6.5,20.5), (-11.5,22.5), (-8.5,22.5), (-7.5,22.5), (-6.5,22.5))\n\n### New Boiler Installation at (21.0, 40.5)\nConsists of:\n- Boiler at (21.0, 40.5) - placed but not yet connected to water supply\n- Currently contains coal but not operational\n\n### Coal Mining Operation at (16.0, 21.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (16.0, 21.0) - extracting coal\n- Wooden chest at (16.5, 23.5) - coal storage\n- Burner inserter at (16.5, 22.5) - transfers coal from drill to chest\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Variable reference errors (updated)\n- Steam engine variable undefined (occurred 4 times total) - ensure variables are properly initialized before use\n- Storage tank reference failed (occurred 2 times) - verify entity existence before operations\n- 'poles' variable undefined (new) - check all variable names before use in connection operations\n\n### Power system issues (updated)\n- Pumpjack still not receiving power despite pole placement - complete power connections\n- Failed to connect distant boiler (21.0,40.5) to existing water supply - build local offshore pump instead\n- Direct coal insertion to pumpjack failed (occurred 4 times) - pumpjacks require electricity, not fuel\n\n### Fluid system problems (new)\n- Long-distance pipe connections failing (occurred 3 times) - maximum connection distance is ~10 tiles\n- Offshore pump placement failed - ensure placement on deep water tiles\n- Boiler removed due to connection issues - verify connection feasibility before placement\n\n### Entity management (recurring)\n- Storage tank placement failed due to direction parameter - always specify direction for placeable entities\n- Failed to get entities at specified positions - always check entity existence before operations\n\n### Construction patterns (updated)\n- Complete power plant before attempting to power other systems\n- Verify all system components exist before connection attempts\n- For distant fluid systems, build local supply infrastructure\n- Check maximum connection distances for pipes and power poles\n\n### General tips (updated)\n- When debugging, check entity status messages carefully (\"not receiving electricity\", \"no fluid present\")\n- For complex systems, build and test components sequentially\n- Maintain backup of critical infrastructure positions\n- Verify power requirements for each machine type (electric vs fuel-powered)"}
