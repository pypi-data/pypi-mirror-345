{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-46.5, -123.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-46.5, -123.5)\n- Steam Engine at position (-40.5, -113.5)\n- Pipe Group at position (-46.5, -122.5) connecting the offshore pump to the steam engine\n- Electricity Group at position (-45.803, -115.682) consisting of multiple small electric poles connecting the steam engine to the power network\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -76.0) with a wooden chest at position (-15.5, -77.5) for iron ore collection\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -73.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n- Stone Furnace at position (9.0, -64.0) and (6.0, -62.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n- Wooden Chest at position (7.5, -61.5) storing iron plates\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) not receiving electricity, intended to move items from the furnace to a wooden chest at position (6.5, -59.5)\n- Lab with automation science packs but not receiving power\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Boiler Placement\n- Ensure that the boiler is placed on a suitable tile. Check for obstacles or unsuitable terrain before attempting to place the boiler.\n\n### Errors in Power Connection\n- Ensure that all power-consuming entities are connected to the power network. Verify that the steam engine is connected to the power grid and receiving input liquid.\n\n### Errors in Fuel Management\n- Ensure that all burner mining drills and furnaces have adequate fuel to operate. Regularly check and refill fuel to avoid interruptions.\n\n### Errors in Resource Management\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Regularly supply furnaces with raw materials to maintain production efficiency.\n\n### Errors in Inserter Power Supply\n- Ensure that inserters are connected to the power network. Verify that they are receiving electricity to function properly."}
