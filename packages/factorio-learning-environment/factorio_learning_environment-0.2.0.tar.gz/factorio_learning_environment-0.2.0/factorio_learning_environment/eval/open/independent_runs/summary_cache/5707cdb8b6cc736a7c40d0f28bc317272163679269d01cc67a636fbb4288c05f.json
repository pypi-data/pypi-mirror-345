{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Electricity Generator at (x=-3.0, y=2.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump (x=-9.5, y=-0.5)\n- Boiler (x=-3.0, y=2.5) [fuel: 21 coal]\n- Steam engine (x=0.5, y=2.5)\nConnected by pipes and power poles (working, producing 13150.0 power)\n\n#### Oil Processing Facility\n1. Crude Oil Extraction:\n   - Pumpjack (x=17.5, y=40.5) [working, connected to power]\n   - Storage tank (x=4.5, y=15.5) [110.84 crude oil]\n\n2. Oil Refinery:\n   - Oil refinery (x=9.5, y=15.5) [FLUID_INGREDIENT_SHORTAGE, Basic Oil Processing]\n   - Connected to:\n     - Crude oil input (9.44 crude oil)\n     - Petroleum gas output pipe (empty)\n\n3. Chemical Processing:\n   - Chemical plant (x=2.5, y=8.5) [FLUID_INGREDIENT_SHORTAGE, Sulfur recipe]\n   - Connected to:\n     - Water input (60 water)\n     - Petroleum gas input (not connected)\n     - Sulfur output tank (x=6.5, y=8.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Persistent Pipe Connection Failures\n- Multiple connection attempts between pumpjack (x=17.5,y=40.5) and storage tank (x=4.5,y=15.5) failing\n  - Verify path is completely clear of obstructions\n  - Use underground pipes for long-distance connections\n  - Consider rebuilding entire pipeline with fresh pipes\n\n#### Fluid System Validation\n- Chemical plant shows FLUID_INGREDIENT_SHORTAGE despite water connection\n  - Petroleum gas input remains unconnected\n  - Verify all connection points are properly aligned\n  - Check recipe requirements match fluid types\n\n#### Empty Source Connections\n- Attempted to connect empty petroleum gas source to chemical plant\n  - Ensure refinery is producing petroleum gas first\n  - Verify storage tank (x=14.5,y=30.5) has fluid before connecting\n\n#### Power System Issues\n- Boiler ran out of fuel (coal: 0)\n  - Monitor fuel levels and automate replenishment\n- Steam engine connection error (attempting to connect to itself)\n  - Verify target entities are different from source\n\n#### API Usage Errors\n- Attempted to use Prototype.PipeToGround (correct name: PipeToGround)\n  - Verify exact prototype names in API documentation\n\n#### Successful Fixes\n- Boiler refueled (now 21 coal)\n- Steam engine restored (13150.0 power)\n- Pumpjack operational (1600.0 power)\n\n#### General Fluid System Tips\n1. Verify fluid production at source first\n2. Check all intermediate storage levels\n3. Validate pipe connections end-to-end\n4. Use underground pipes for cleaner layouts\n5. Monitor entity status indicators continuously"}
