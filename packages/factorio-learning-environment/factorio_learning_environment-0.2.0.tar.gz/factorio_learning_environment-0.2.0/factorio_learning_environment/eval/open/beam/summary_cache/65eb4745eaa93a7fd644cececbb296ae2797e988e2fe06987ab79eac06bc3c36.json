{"content": "It appears that the search for an operational **Burner Inserter** is not yielding any results, despite the presence of **Burner Inserters** in the game state. This could be due to the specific status filter I applied, which may not be capturing the available entities correctly.\n\n### Steps to Diagnose and Resolve the Issue\n\n1. **List All Burner Inserters**: I will retrieve all **Burner Inserters** on the map without filtering by status to confirm their presence.\n\n2. **Check Their Statuses**: After listing them, I will check their statuses to understand why none were recognized as operational.\n\n3. **Insert Coal**: If any **Burner Inserters** are found, I will attempt to insert coal into one of them.\n\n### Implementation\n\nLet's implement these steps:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Retrieve all Burner Inserters on the map without filtering by status\nburner_inserters = get_entities({Prototype.BurnerInserter})\n\n# Step 2: Check if any Burner Inserters are found\nif burner_inserters:\n    print(\"Found Burner Inserters:\")\n    for inserter in burner_inserters:\n        print(f\" - {inserter.name} at {inserter.position} with status {inserter.status}\")\n\n    # Step 3: Attempt to insert coal into the first found Burner Inserter\n    first_burner_inserter = burner_inserters[0]  # Take the first one found\n    if current_inventory.get(Prototype.Coal, 0) >= 5:\n        insert_item(Prototype.Coal, first_burner_inserter, 5)  # Insert coal into the first Burner Inserter\n        print(\"Inserted 5 coal into the Burner Inserter.\")\n        \n        # Step 4: Check the status of the Burner Inserter after the insertion\n        burner_inserter_status = first_burner_inserter.status\n        print(\"Status of the Burner Inserter after refueling:\", burner_inserter_status)\n    else:\n        print(\"Not enough coal in inventory to insert into the Burner Inserter.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No Burner Inserters found on the map.\")\n```\n\n### Expected Outcome\nThis approach should help identify any **Burner Inserters** present on the map and allow for the insertion of coal into one of them if available. If no **Burner Inserters** are found, it will provide a clearer understanding of the situation.", "summary_range": "[1-2016]"}
