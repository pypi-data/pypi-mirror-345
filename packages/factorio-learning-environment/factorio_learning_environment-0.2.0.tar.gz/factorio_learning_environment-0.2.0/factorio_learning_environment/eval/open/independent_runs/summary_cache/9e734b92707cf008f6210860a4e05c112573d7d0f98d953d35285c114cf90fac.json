{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (0, 0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace (position 0, 0)\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at position (42, -83)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position 42, -83)\n- Burner Inserter (position 43.5, -81.5) that is waiting for space in destination\n- Wooden Chest (position 42.5, -81.5) with coal inventory\n\n### Iron Ore Storage at position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of:\n- Wooden Chest (position -14.5, -48.5) with iron ore inventory\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to insufficient fuel\n- Ensure that burner mining drills are supplied with fuel to avoid them becoming inactive. Regularly check and refill their fuel supply.\n\n### Errors when crafting due to lack of materials\n- Ensure you have enough Copper Plates to craft an Assembling Machine. Regularly monitor your inventory and gather necessary resources in advance.\n\n### Errors when using inserters\n- Burner Inserters are often waiting for source items or space in destination. Make sure that the source (like a wooden chest) has items available and that the destination (like another chest or machine) has enough space to accept items.\n\n### Errors when harvesting\n- Ensure you are close enough to the target entity when harvesting resources to avoid errors.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n#### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked yet.\n\n#### Important Variables\n- `copper_ore`: int\n- `iron_plate`: int\n- `coal`: int\n- `iron_ore`: int\n- `wood`: int\n- `burner_mining_drill_status`: str\n- `stone_furnace_status`: str"}
