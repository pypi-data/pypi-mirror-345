For example, attempting to place a burner mining drill without having one in inventory will result in an error.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient resources for crafting\n- Make sure you have enough resources in your inventory to craft the desired item. For instance, attempting to craft a Burner Mining Drill without sufficient resources will fail.\n\n### Errors when placing entities too far from the player\n- Move closer to the target position before placing an entity. The maximum distance for placing an entity is limited, so ensure you are within range.\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied tiles\n- Check the target tile for existing entities or obstructions before placing a new entity. If the tile is occupied or unsuitable (e.g., water), adjust the placement position or direction accordingly.\n\n### Errors when placing entities with incorrect spacing or direction\n- Adjust the spacing or direction when placing entities next to others. If a collision is detected or the area is unsuitable, consider increasing the spacing or changing the direction to avoid placement errors."}
