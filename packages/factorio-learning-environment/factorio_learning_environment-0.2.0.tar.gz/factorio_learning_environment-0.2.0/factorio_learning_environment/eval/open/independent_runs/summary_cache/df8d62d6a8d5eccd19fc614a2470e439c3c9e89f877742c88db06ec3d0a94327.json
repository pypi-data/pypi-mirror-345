{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Automation Science Pack Production Setup at (8.5, 13.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine-1 at (8.5, 13.5)\n- Output inserter (burner-inserter) at (10.5, 13.5)\n- Output wooden chest at (11.5, 13.5)\n- Input copper inserter at (5.5, 14.5)\n- Input iron gear inserter at (9.5, 16.5)\n- Transport belt system connecting inputs\n\n### Mining and Smelting Setups\nMultiple mining-smelting chains set up at:\n1. First chain at (-28.0, -61.0):\n- Burner mining drill\n- Input chest at (-27.5, -59.5)\n- Stone furnace at (-25.0, -59.0)\n- Output chest at (-22.5, -58.5) with iron plates\n\n2. Second chain at (-18.0, -53.0):\n- Burner mining drill\n- Input chest at (-17.5, -51.5)\n- Stone furnace at (-15.0, -51.0)\n- Output chest at (-12.5, -50.5) with iron plates\n\n3. Coal mining setup at (41.0, -82.0):\n- Burner mining drill\n- Output chest at (41.5, -80.5) with coal\n- Burner inserter at (41.5, -79.5)\n\n### Power Generation System\nLocated around (-4.5, 12.5):\n- Steam engine at (-4.5, 12.5)\n- Boiler at (-4.5, 16.0)\n- Offshore pump at (-3.5, 27.5)\n- Connected pipe network for water and steam\n- Electric pole network connecting power consumers\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities near existing structures\n- Check for existing entities before placing new ones\n- Increase spacing or change direction when placing inserters next to assemblers/belts\n- Consider removing blocking entities first if they're misplaced\n\n### Errors with chest and inventory operations\n- Ensure required items are in inventory before attempting to insert into chests\n- Verify chest positions are accessible to inserters before placement\n\n### Entity placement conflicts\n- When placing entities like furnaces, ensure the target location is clear\n- Remove any existing entities that might block placement\n- Consider alternative positions if the desired location is blocked\n\n### Resource management\n- Ensure burner devices have fuel before operation\n- Keep mining drills fueled to maintain resource production\n- Monitor input/output chest contents to maintain production flow"}
