{"content": "\"\"\"\nAfter waiting for the furnace to process, it successfully produced a total of **18 pieces of iron plates**. However, it now shows **\"NO INGREDIENTS\"**, indicating that it has completed processing and currently has no materials to smelt further.\n\n### Current Inventory Overview:\n- 3 pieces of stone furnaces\n- 2 pieces of coal remaining for fuel\n- 5 pieces of copper ore\n- **18 pieces of iron plates** produced and available.\n- The furnace is now empty of iron ore and showing no further inputs.\n\n### Observations:\n- The furnace has effectively utilized its resources to produce a significant amount of iron plates.\n- However, the lack of raw materials means that production has halted, and I need to consider my next steps carefully.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Crafting Opportunities**: With **18 iron plates** available, I should explore what can be crafted with this resource.\n2. **Resource Gathering**: I need to gather more iron ore and copper ore to ensure that the furnace can operate continuously in the future.\n3. **Research and Technology**: Investigate if there are any technological advancements or recipes that can be unlocked to enhance production capabilities.\n\nLet\u2019s check for specific crafting options with the available iron plates and see if any crafting can be done directly. \n\"\"\"\n\n# Check for specific recipes that can be crafted using iron plates\niron_plate_recipe = get_prototype_recipe(Prototype.IronPlate)\ncopper_cable_recipe = get_prototype_recipe(Prototype.CopperCable)\n\n# Print available recipes related to current resources\nprint(f\"Iron Plate Recipe: {iron_plate_recipe}\")  # Status of the iron plate recipe\nprint(f\"Copper Cable Recipe: {copper_cable_recipe}\")  # Status of the copper cable recipe\n\n# Additionally, check for any other relevant recipes that could utilize iron plates\nother_recipes = [get_prototype_recipe(prototype) for prototype in Prototype if prototype != Prototype.IronPlate and prototype != Prototype.CopperCable]\nprint(f\"Other available crafting recipes: {[recipe.name for recipe in other_recipes if recipe.enabled]}\")  # List all other available recipes based on enabled status.", "summary_range": "[1-212]"}
