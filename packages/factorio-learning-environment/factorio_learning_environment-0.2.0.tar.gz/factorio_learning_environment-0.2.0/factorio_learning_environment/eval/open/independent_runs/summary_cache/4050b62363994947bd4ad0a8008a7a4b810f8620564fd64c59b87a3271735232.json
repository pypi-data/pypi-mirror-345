{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16, -51)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (5 units)\n  - Direction: UP\n  - Energy: 2666.67\n  - Status: WORKING\n  - Warnings: Output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Resources: Iron ore (40,000 units)\n  - Drop Position: (x=-16.5, y=-52.5)\n  - Neighbours: Stone Furnace at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)\n\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (14 units)\n  - Direction: UP\n  - Energy: 1600.0\n  - Status: NO_INGREDIENTS\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Furnace Result: Iron Plate (60 units)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied locations\n- Ensure the target tile is unoccupied before attempting to place entities like Wooden Chests, Burner Inserters, and Transport Belts.\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities from incorrect positions\n- Verify the position of entities like Wooden Chests and Stone Furnaces before attempting to interact with them to ensure they exist at the specified coordinates.\n\n### Errors due to blocked output\n- Ensure there is a sink entity in place to accept the output from production entities like the Burner Mining Drill to prevent blockage and maintain efficiency.\n\n### Errors when moving entities\n- Confirm the destination tile is suitable for the entity being moved, such as the Stone Furnace, to avoid placement errors."}
