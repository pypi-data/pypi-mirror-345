Always retrieve and apply the active fluid_system ID from the latest working entities.\n\n- Rigid Pipeline Stabilization Approach:\n  \u2022 Relying on a fixed 10-second waiting period for pipeline stabilization leads to unreliable connectivity. Implement dynamic checks to verify that pipelines are properly connected before retrying.\n\n- Persistent Steam Engine Disconnection:\n  \u2022 Despite multiple reattempts with varying fluid_system IDs, the steam engine remains unconnected. Verify that its connection points align correctly with the operative fluid system to achieve successful linkage."}
