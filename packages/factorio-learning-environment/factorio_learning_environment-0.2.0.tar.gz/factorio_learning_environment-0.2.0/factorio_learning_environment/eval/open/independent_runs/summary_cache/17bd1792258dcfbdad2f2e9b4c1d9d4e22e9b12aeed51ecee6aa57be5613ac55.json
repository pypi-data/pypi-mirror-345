{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility at Position (x=9.0, y=-64.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=9.0, y=-64.0) with a status of full output, fueled by coal and processing copper ore into iron plates.\n\n### Idle Furnace at Position (x=6.0, y=-62.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=6.0, y=-62.0) with no ingredients to smelt, fueled by coal.\n\n### Storage and Inserter System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=7.5, y=-61.5) and another at position (x=6.5, y=-59.5) for storing items.\n- Inserter at position (x=6.5, y=-60.5) not receiving electricity, intended to move items between the furnace and chests.\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=-5.5, y=24.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5) not connected to the fluid system.\n- Boiler at position (x=-5.5, y=24.0) not connected to input liquid.\n- Steam Engine at position (x=-1.5, y=24.5) not connected to the power network.\n\n### Research Lab\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab with input of automation science packs, not receiving power.\n\n### Pipe Networks\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Multiple PipeGroups at various positions, all with status empty and not connected to fluid systems.\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of the following entities:\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at various positions, currently with zero voltage.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Connection Errors with Pipes\n- Ensure that pipes are correctly aligned and connected between the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine to establish a fluid connection.\n\n### Power Supply Issues\n- Verify that all electrical entities, such as inserters and labs, are connected to a functional electricity network. Check the alignment and connectivity of electric poles.\n\n### AttributeError with PipeGroup\n- When manipulating PipeGroup objects, ensure that you are using the correct attributes and methods. The 'prototype' attribute does not exist for PipeGroup objects.\n\n### Placement Blockage\n- Before placing entities, ensure that the target tiles are not occupied by other entities to avoid placement blockage errors."}
