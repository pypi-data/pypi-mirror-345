{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll create a comprehensive report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Mining Complex at (-10, -59)\nComplex mining setup consisting of:\n- Three burner mining drills at positions (-10.0, -59.0), (-8.0, -59.0), (-6.0, -59.0)\n- Three wooden chests at (-9.5, -57.5), (-7.5, -57.5), (-5.5, -57.5) collecting iron ore\n- Multiple burner inserters managing material flow between components\n- Transport belt system connecting the mining area\n\n### Iron Smelting Line at (0, 0)\nLarge smelting array consisting of:\n- Four stone furnaces at (0.0, 0.0), (2.0, 0.0), (4.0, 0.0), (6.0, 0.0)\n- Input chests at (0.5, -2.5), (2.5, -2.5), (4.5, -2.5), (6.5, -2.5)\n- Output chests at (0.5, 2.5), (2.5, 2.5), (4.5, 2.5), (6.5, 2.5)\n- Burner inserters managing input at (0.5, -1.5), (2.5, -1.5), (4.5, -1.5), (6.5, -1.5)\n- Burner inserters managing output at (0.5, 1.5), (2.5, 1.5), (4.5, 1.5), (6.5, 1.5)\n\n### Secondary Production Area at (-27, -59)\nProduction setup consisting of:\n- Stone furnace at (-27.0, -59.0)\n- Burner mining drill at (-28.0, -61.0)\n- Output chest at (-24.5, -58.5) containing iron and copper plates\n- Additional furnaces at (-23.0, -58.0) and (-21.0, -58.0)\n- Multiple burner inserters managing material flow\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Fuel Management Issues\n- Keep monitoring fuel levels in burner mining drills - one drill was found without fuel\n- Ensure consistent fuel supply to all burner devices to maintain continuous operation\n\n### Blocked Output Issues\n- Some inserters are waiting for space in destination - ensure proper item flow and storage capacity\n- Clear blocked furnace outputs regularly to maintain production flow\n\n### Material Flow Issues\n- Multiple inserters are waiting for source items - optimize material supply chains\n- Some furnaces have no ingredients to smelt - ensure consistent ore supply\n\n### Belt System Issues\n- Some belt groups are empty - verify proper connectivity and material flow through transport belt systems\n- Ensure belt connections are properly aligned with input/output positions of machines"}
