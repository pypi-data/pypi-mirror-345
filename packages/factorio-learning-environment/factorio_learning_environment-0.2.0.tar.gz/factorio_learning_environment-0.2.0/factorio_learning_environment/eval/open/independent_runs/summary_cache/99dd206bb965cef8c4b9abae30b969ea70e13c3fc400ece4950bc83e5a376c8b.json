{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nCurrently, there are no structures present on the map. All attempts to place entities such as furnaces, transport belts, and wooden chests have failed, resulting in an empty map.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities in non-buildable areas\n- Ensure the area is buildable before attempting to place entities like furnaces, transport belts, or wooden chests. Check for obstructions or terrain issues that may prevent placement.\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Verify that the target tile is unoccupied before placing an entity. Attempting to place entities like transport belts or chests on occupied tiles will result in failure.\n\n### Errors due to lack of nearby entities for resource insertion\n- Make sure there are appropriate entities nearby that can accept resources like coal. Attempting to insert resources into non-existent or incorrectly placed entities will lead to errors.\n\n### Errors due to unavailable resources\n- Confirm that the necessary resources, such as coal, are available and accessible for the intended operations. Lack of resources will prevent successful entity operation.\n\n### Errors when checking for global build restrictions\n- Be aware of any global build restrictions that may prevent the placement of entities in certain areas. Check these restrictions before attempting to place new structures."}
