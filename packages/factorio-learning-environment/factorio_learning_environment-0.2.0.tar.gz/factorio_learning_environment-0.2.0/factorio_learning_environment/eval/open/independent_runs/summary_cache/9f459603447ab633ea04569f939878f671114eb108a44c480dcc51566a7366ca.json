{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-18.5, 19.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position -18.5, 19.5), boiler (position -13.5, 20.0), and offshore pump (position -11.5, 26.5).\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(-18.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position -18.0, -49.0) and a furnace (position -18.0, -49.0).\n\n### Iron plate factory at position(-18.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace (position -18.0, -49.0) that processes iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Lab at position(-17.5, 23.5)\nConsists of lab (position -17.5, 23.5) for research activities.\n\n### Assembling machine at position(-21.5, 25.5)\nConsists of assembling machine (position -21.5, 25.5) for crafting automation science packs.\n\n### Pipe groups\nConsists of multiple pipe groups facilitating fluid transport:\n- PipeGroup (fluid system 44031, position -12.5, 21.5)\n- PipeGroup (fluid system 44028, position -18.5, 16.5)\n\n### Electric pole group\nConsists of multiple small electric poles providing power:\n- Small electric pole (position -15.5, 18.5)\n- Small electric pole (position -16.5, 18.5)\n- Small electric pole (position -16.5, 20.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when crafting items due to missing ingredients\n- Ensure that all required ingredients are available in the inventory before attempting to craft items. For example, iron-gear-wheel requires iron plates, which must be produced in a furnace.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors related to power connections\n- Check that all power-consuming entities (like the steam engine and assembling machine) are connected to a power network to avoid warnings about lack of electricity."}
