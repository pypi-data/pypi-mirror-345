{"content": "I see the issue. Instead of trying to pick up the existing inserter, let's try a fresh approach by placing the inserter in the correct position from the start:\n\n```python\n# Get our reference points\ndrill = get_entities({Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill})[0]\nfurnace = get_entities({Prototype.StoneFurnace})[0]\nprint(f\"Drill at {drill.position} with drop at {drill.drop_position}\")\nprint(f\"Furnace at {furnace.position}\")\n\n# Move to position near drill's drop position\nmove_to(Position(20.5, -17.5))  # Move to exact position where items need to be picked up\nprint(f\"Moved to position between drill and furnace\")\n\n# Place inserter at the correct position to bridge drill and furnace\ninserter = place_entity(\n    Prototype.BurnerInserter,\n    position=Position(20.5, -17.5)  # Place directly at drill's output\n)\nprint(f\"Placed inserter at {inserter.position}\")\n\n# Rotate inserter to face from drill to furnace\nrotate_entity(inserter, Direction.RIGHT)\nprint(\"Rotated inserter to face furnace\")\n\n# Add fuel to inserter\ninsert_item(Prototype.Coal, inserter, quantity=1)\nprint(\"Added fuel to inserter\")\n\n# Verify setup\nprint(f\"Drill drop position: {drill.drop_position}\")\nprint(f\"Inserter pickup position: {inserter.pickup_position}\")\nprint(f\"Inserter drop position: {inserter.drop_position}\")\nprint(f\"Furnace position: {furnace.position}\")\nprint(f\"Final inventory: {inspect_inventory()}\")\n```\n\nThis approach:\n1. Places the inserter exactly where the drill's output is\n2. Rotates it to face the furnace\n3. Ensures it can reach both the drill's output and furnace input\n4. Adds fuel to power it\n\nThe key is placing the inserter at the exact position where it can bridge the gap between the drill's output and the furnace's input.", "summary_range": "[1-2954]"}
