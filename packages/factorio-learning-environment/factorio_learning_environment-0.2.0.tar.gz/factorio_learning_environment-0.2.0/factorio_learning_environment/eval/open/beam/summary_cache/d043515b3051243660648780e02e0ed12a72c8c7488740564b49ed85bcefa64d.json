{"content": "### Stone Furnace Recipe Overview:\nThe recipe for crafting a **Stone Furnace** requires:\n- **5 Stone**\n\n### Current Inventory Overview:\n- 3 pieces of stone furnaces\n- 2 pieces of coal remaining for fuel\n- 5 pieces of iron ore\n- 3 pieces of copper ore\n- 3 pieces of iron plates produced and available.\n\n### Observations:\n- I currently do not have any **Stone** in my inventory, which means I cannot craft an additional Stone Furnace at this time.\n- The lack of Stone and the inability to produce Copper Plates limits my options for expanding production capabilities.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Gather Stone**: I need to find and gather Stone from the environment to enable the crafting of additional furnaces or other necessary components.\n2. **Manual Mining**: If I can find a nearby Stone deposit, I should manually mine it to collect enough Stone for crafting.\n3. **Consider Other Technologies**: I can also revisit the available technologies to see if any can be researched that would aid in resource gathering or processing.\n\nLet's proceed to gather some Stone from the environment. \n\n### Action Plan:\n- Move to a location where Stone is available and begin mining. \n- Once I have enough Stone, I can craft additional furnaces or explore other crafting options.\n\nLet's find a suitable location for mining Stone. \n\"\"\"\n\n# Move to a position to mine Stone (assuming a nearby position)\nmove_to(Position(x=1, y=1))  # Example position where Stone can be found\n\n# Attempt to mine Stone from the environment\nmine_item(Prototype.Stone, quantity=5)  # Mine 5 pieces of Stone from the environment. \n\n# After mining, check the overall inventory to confirm Stone collection\noverall_inventory_after_mining = inspect_inventory() \nprint(f\"Overall current inventory after mining: {overall_inventory_after_mining}\")  # Check total inventory after mining for Stone. \nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")  # Review entities on the map after mining.", "summary_range": "[1-256]"}
