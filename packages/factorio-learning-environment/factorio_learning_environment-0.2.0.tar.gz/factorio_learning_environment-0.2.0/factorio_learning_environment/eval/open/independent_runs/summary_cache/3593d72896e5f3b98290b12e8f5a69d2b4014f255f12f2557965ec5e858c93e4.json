For example, the furnaces at positions (0.0, 0.0) and (2.0, 0.0) reported being full, preventing the insertion of coal.\n\n### Errors when attempting to operate furnaces without coal\n- Make sure to provide coal to the furnaces to operate them. All furnaces reported needing coal to operate.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing. This applies to the furnaces that are unable to accept more items due to full inventories."}
