{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron ore mining and smelting structure at position around (17.5, 72.5)\nConsists of the following connected entities:\n- Electric mining drill at position (17.5, 72.5) facing down, powered but output blocked due to furnace belt blockage.\n- Stone furnace at position (18.0, 75.0) fueled with coal and actively smelting iron ore, output inventory often full.\n- Three wooden chests at positions (19.5, 75.5), (21.5, 75.5), and (21.5, 77.5) used for staged storage of iron plates.\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5) and (20.5, 77.5) fueled and operational, transferring iron plates between furnace and chests.\n- Small electric pole at (15.5, 75.5) connected to power network.\n- Output blockage on furnace belt persists, limiting mining drill throughput.\n\nThis structure supports iron ore extraction, smelting, and intermediate storage of iron plates, with improved inserter fueling and power connectivity but unresolved output belt blockage.\n\n### Steam power generation structure at position around (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, -0.5) extracting water.\n- Boiler at (-5.0, 2.5) fueled with coal and operational.\n- Steam engine at (0.5, 6.5) generating power, connected to boiler via pipes.\n- Small electric poles placed near boiler (-4.5, -0.5), steam engine (0.5, 3.5), and newly placed poles at (0.5, 6.5), (17.5, 72.5), and (25.5, 80.5) forming an extended power network.\n\nThis structure reliably produces electricity from steam power, supplying the factory\u2019s electric grid.\n\n### Iron gear wheel assembly structure at position around (25.5, 80.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine 2 at (25.5, 80.5), powered and connected to the electric network.\n- Input wooden chest at (21.5, 75.5) receiving iron plates, with iron plates inserted directly into assembler input.\n- Output wooden chest at (25.5, 82.5), currently empty.\n- Burner inserter at (25.5, 83.5) fueled and operational, moving assembled items to output chest.\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 77.5) and (25.5, 83.5) fueled and active.\n- Assembling machine intermittently holds iron plates and iron gear wheels in input and output inventories but frequently reports shortage of iron plates preventing continuous crafting.\n\nThis structure is configured for iron gear wheel production with power and inserter support but requires consistent iron plate supply and clearing of input/output inventories for smooth operation.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity placement conflicts due to occupied tiles\n- Multiple failed attempts to place small electric poles near furnace at (18.0, 75.0) and steam engine at (0.5, 6.5) due to collisions with existing entities (mining drill, furnace) or unplaceable terrain (water).\n- To avoid these errors, verify tile occupancy before placement, increase spacing, change pole orientation, or select alternative nearby positions.\n\n### Inserter inventory and fuel management\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5), (20.5, 77.5), and (25.5, 83.5) consistently fueled and operational.\n- Inserters occasionally wait for source items due to empty chests, especially at (20.5, 75.5) and (20.5, 77.5).\n- Maintain steady input materials in chests feeding inserters to prevent stoppages.\n\n### Crafting and recipe dependency errors\n- Assembling machine at (25.5, 80.5) intermittently holds iron plates and iron gear wheels but frequently reports missing iron plates preventing crafting.\n- Input and output inventories sometimes empty despite iron plates being inserted into input chest.\n- Ensure continuous supply of iron plates to input chest and clear output chest regularly to avoid crafting interruptions.\n\n### Output blockage and power connectivity warnings\n- Mining drill at (17.5, 72.5) continues to report \"furnace belt at drop position is blocked,\" causing output blockage and limiting throughput.\n- Furnace output inventory often full, preventing further smelting.\n- Power network extended with additional poles at (0.5, 6.5), (17.5, 72.5), and (25.5, 80.5), improving connectivity.\n- To resolve output blockage, clear or extend output belts and chests to accept items and maintain free output inventory space.\n\n### Extraction errors from empty chests\n"}
