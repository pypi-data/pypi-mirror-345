{"content": "I see the problem now. The current setup is too cramped - the drill and furnace are right next to each other, leaving no room for an inserter. We need to rebuild the setup with proper spacing:\n\n```python\n# First, let's clear the existing setup\ndrill = get_entities({Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill})[0]\nfurnace = get_entities({Prototype.StoneFurnace})[0]\n\nprint(\"Removing existing entities...\")\ndestroy_entity(drill)\ndestroy_entity(furnace)\n\n# Now rebuild with proper spacing\nprint(\"Rebuilding setup with correct spacing...\")\n\n# Place drill\nnew_drill = place_entity(\n    Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill,\n    position=Position(19.0, -17.0)\n)\nprint(f\"Placed new drill at {new_drill.position}\")\n\n# Place furnace with 2 tiles gap for inserter\nnew_furnace = place_entity(\n    Prototype.StoneFurnace,\n    position=Position(22.0, -17.0)  # 3 tiles to the right of drill\n)\nprint(f\"Placed new furnace at {new_furnace.position}\")\n\n# Now place inserter in the gap\ninserter = place_entity(\n    Prototype.BurnerInserter,\n    position=Position(20.5, -17.0)  # Between drill and furnace\n)\nprint(f\"Placed inserter at {inserter.position}\")\n\n# Add fuel to all machines\ninsert_item(Prototype.Coal, new_drill, quantity=5)\ninsert_item(Prototype.Coal, inserter, quantity=5)\ninsert_item(Prototype.Coal, new_furnace, quantity=5)\nprint(\"Added fuel to all machines\")\n\n# Wait for system to work\nprint(\"Waiting for system to process ore...\")\nsleep(10)\n\n# Check final status\nprint(f\"\\nFinal system status:\")\nprint(f\"Drill status: {new_drill.status}\")\nprint(f\"Inserter status: {inserter.status}\")\nprint(f\"Furnace status: {new_furnace.status}\")\nprint(f\"Furnace inventory: {inspect_inventory(new_furnace)}\")\n```\n\nThis approach:\n1. Removes the existing entities that are too close together\n2. Rebuilds them with proper spacing (3 tiles between drill and furnace)\n3. Places an inserter in the middle\n4. Adds fuel to all machines\n\nThis should give us enough room to place the inserter and create a working ore processing line.", "summary_range": "[1-3258]"}
