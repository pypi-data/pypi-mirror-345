{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo new structures have been successfully placed on the map. Multiple attempts to deploy a Lab at position (0.5, 2.5) were made but none succeeded due to inventory shortages and cascading crafting errors. In parallel, the agent accessed existing furnace structures\u2014an iron furnace at Position(x=5.0, y=5.0) and a copper furnace at Position(x=-27.0, y=-60.0)\u2014to process ores into plates. These furnaces were used for smelting operations but were not constructed by the agent.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 API Usage Errors for Entity Retrieval\n\u2003\u2013 Avoid using unsupported keywords or argument formats when calling get_entities. The function was invoked with a keyword argument \u201cradius\u201d and later with multiple positional arguments, both of which lead to signature mismatches. Always confirm the correct calling convention per the API documentation.\n\u2003\n\u2022 Lab Placement and Iteration Mistakes\n\u2003\u2013 Before attempting to place a Lab at (0.5, 2.5), verify that the Lab item exists in the inventory to prevent placement failures.\n\u2003\u2013 Ensure that functions returning collections (e.g., the list of labs) are validated for None before iterating over them.\n\n\u2022 Lab Crafting Supply Chain Shortcomings\n\u2003\u2013 Multiple crafting errors indicate missing sub-ingredients for Lab production (such as iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, and copper-cables). Ensure that all production chains are complete by securing adequate base resources (e.g., iron-plates and copper-plates) and establishing the necessary smelting or assembly capabilities before attempting to craft complex items like Labs."}
