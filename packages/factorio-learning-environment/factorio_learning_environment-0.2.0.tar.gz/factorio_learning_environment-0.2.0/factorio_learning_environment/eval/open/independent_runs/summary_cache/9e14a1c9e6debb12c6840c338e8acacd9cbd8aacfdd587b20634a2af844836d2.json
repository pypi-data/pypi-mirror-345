{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-46.5) collecting iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5) transferring iron ore from the wooden chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-1.5, y=0.5) transferring iron plates from the furnace.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Ensure there is no existing object at the target location before attempting to place a new entity. This can be done by checking the position for occupancy or clearing the area beforehand.\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities from incorrect positions\n- Verify the position of the entity you want to interact with before attempting to retrieve it. This can be done by ensuring the coordinates are correct and the entity type matches.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient inventory items\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert or refuel entities. Regularly check your inventory levels and replenish as necessary.\n\n### Errors due to inserters waiting for source items\n- Ensure that the source entity (e.g., chest or furnace) has the necessary items for the inserter to function. This can be achieved by maintaining a steady supply of materials to the source entity.\n\n### Errors when inspecting entities with no inventory\n- Ensure the entity you are inspecting has an inventory to check. This can be verified by confirming the entity type and its current status before inspection."}
