Harvest and craft additional pipes if necessary.\n- Verify that the connection path between entities is clear and that the entities are correctly aligned for connection.\n\n### Errors when Inserting Items\n- Before inserting items into an entity, ensure that the items are available in your inventory.\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities\n- Verify that you have the required entity in your inventory before attempting to place it on the map.\n\n### Errors with Electric Network\n- Ensure that all electric poles are properly connected to form a complete electric network. Check that the poles are within range to connect to each other and to the entities requiring power.\n\n### Assertion Errors\n- Regularly check the status of your entities to ensure they are working as expected. If an entity is not working, investigate and resolve any underlying issues such as missing connections or insufficient resources."}
