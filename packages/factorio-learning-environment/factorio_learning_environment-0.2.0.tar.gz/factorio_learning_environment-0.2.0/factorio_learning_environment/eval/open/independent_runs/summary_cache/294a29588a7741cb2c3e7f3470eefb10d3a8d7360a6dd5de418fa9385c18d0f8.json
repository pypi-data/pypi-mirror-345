Check for existing objects or unplaceable terrain like water.\n- Verify that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to place them.\n\n### Errors in Crafting\n- Ensure all required ingredients are available before attempting to craft items. For example, iron plates are necessary for crafting pipe-to-ground but require a crafting machine or furnace.\n\n### Connection Errors\n- Make sure all components of a structure are properly connected. For instance, steam engines and boilers need to be connected to function correctly.\n\n### Inventory Management\n- Keep track of your inventory to avoid running out of essential items like pipes during construction activities."}
