{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n--------------------\nNo structures have been successfully placed on the map. The agent repeatedly attempted to establish a Lab at position (0.5, 2.5) with the intent to supply Automation Science Packs for research, but due to inventory shortages and persistent crafting failures no Lab was ever built. Although available furnaces (an iron smelting furnace at (5.0, 5.0) and a copper smelting furnace at (\u201327.0, \u201360.0)) were identified and used for processing resources, these were not created by the agent in the current steps.\n\nERROR TIPS\n----------\n\u2022 Incorrect get_entities() Usage:\n  \u2013 Avoid passing unexpected keyword arguments (e.g. \u2018radius\u2019) or extra positional arguments. Always verify and use the API\u2019s defined parameter signature.\n\n\u2022 Iterating Over a None Value:\n  \u2013 Before filtering or iterating over the results of get_entities(), ensure that the returned collection is not None by applying an empty list fallback when necessary.\n\n\u2022 Structure Placement Without Inventory Items:\n  \u2013 Confirm that the required item (such as a Lab) is present in the inventory prior to attempting placement to prevent errors like \u201cNo lab in inventory.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Insufficient Resources for Crafting:\n  \u2013 Verify that all sub-ingredients necessary for complex recipes (for example, those needed to craft a Lab\u2014iron-gear-wheels, electronic circuits, copper cables, etc.) are available. Address shortages early to prevent cascading crafting failures.\n\n\u2022 Crafting Chain Dependencies:\n  \u2013 Recognize that missing basic resources (such as iron-plates or copper-plates) may block production of intermediary components. Plan resource conversion and production steps accordingly to satisfy end-product requirements."}
