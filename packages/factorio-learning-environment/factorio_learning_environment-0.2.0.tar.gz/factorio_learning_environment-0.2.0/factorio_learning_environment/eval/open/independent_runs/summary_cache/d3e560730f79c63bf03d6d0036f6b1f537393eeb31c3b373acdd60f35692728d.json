{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll generate a new report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing Setup (around position x=41, y=-82)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0) mining coal\n- Wooden chest at (41.5, -80.5) collecting coal\n- Burner inserter at (42.5, -80.5) moving coal from chest\n- Stone furnace at (45.0, -81.0)\n\nThe setup appears to be a coal mining and processing line, though it's currently experiencing some operational issues with full storage and blocked paths.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Conflicts\n- Before placing entities, ensure the target location is completely clear of other entities and items\n- When placing connected structures (like inserter-furnace pairs), verify the alignment and spacing first\n- Clear any items blocking placement positions before attempting to place new entities\n\n### Storage and Flow Issues\n- Monitor chest capacity and implement emptying mechanism when chest gets full\n- Clear blocked transport paths when \"output blocked\" warnings appear\n- Ensure proper spacing between inserters and their target entities\n\n### Entity Alignment Issues\n- When placing furnaces to work with inserters, ensure the furnace input position aligns with the inserter's drop position\n- Double-check entity orientations (especially inserters) to ensure proper material flow\n\nNAMESPACE\n\n### Variables\n- `belt`: TransportBelt\n- `furnace`: Furnace\n- `second_inserter`: BurnerInserter\n\n### Entity States\n- BurnerMiningDrill: Working state with full chest warning\n- Chest: Normal state but full (800 coal)\n- BurnerInserter: Waiting state due to blocked output\n- Furnace: No ingredients state, fuel full\n\nThe setup shows attempts to create an automated coal processing line, but is facing several placement and alignment challenges that need to be resolved for proper operation."}
