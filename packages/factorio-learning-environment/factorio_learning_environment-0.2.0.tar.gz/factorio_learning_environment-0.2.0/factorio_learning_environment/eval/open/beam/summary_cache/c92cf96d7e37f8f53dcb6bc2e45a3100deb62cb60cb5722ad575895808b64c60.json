{"content": "The repeated errors indicate that there is a persistent issue with inspecting the inventory of the **Iron Chest**. It seems that the **Iron Chest** might not be accessible or is not recognized by the API at the specified coordinates. \n\n### Troubleshooting Steps\n\n1. **Verify Entity Existence**:\n   - First, I'll check if the **Iron Chest** is still present in the game world by listing all entities on the map.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Get all entities on the map to verify if the Iron Chest exists.\nentities_on_map = get_entities()\nprint(\"Current Entities on the Map:\", entities_on_map)\n```\n\n2. **Identify the Iron Chest**:\n   - If the **Iron Chest** is present, I will confirm its position and ensure that I am using the correct reference to interact with it.\n\n3. **Harvest Coal Directly**:\n   - If the **Iron Chest** is not accessible, I will focus on harvesting Coal directly from the resource patch.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n- If the **Iron Chest** is found in the entities list, I will attempt to interact with it again using its correct reference.\n- If the **Iron Chest** is not found, I will proceed to harvest Coal from the nearest resource patch.\n\n### Execute the Verification\n\nLet's execute the verification step to see the current state of the entities in the game world. \n\n```python\n# Check all entities on the map to see if the Iron Chest is present.\nentities_on_map = get_entities()\nprint(\"Entities on the Map:\", entities_on_map)\n```\n\n### Based on the Output\n\n- If the **Iron Chest** is listed, I will attempt to interact with it using the correct reference.\n- If it is not listed, I will proceed to harvest Coal directly from the nearest resource patch. \n\n### Harvesting Coal\n\nIf I need to harvest Coal, I will move to the nearest Coal resource and attempt to gather some.\n\n```python\n# Move to the nearest Coal resource.\nmove_to(nearest(Resource.Coal))\n\n# Harvest a quantity of Coal (e.g., 10).\nharvested_coal = harvest_resource(position=nearest(Resource.Coal), quantity=10)\nprint(\"Harvested Coal:\", harvested_coal)\n```\n\n### Final Steps\n\nAfter harvesting, I will check my inventory again and attempt to insert Coal into the **Burner Inserter**.", "summary_range": "[1-1930]"}
