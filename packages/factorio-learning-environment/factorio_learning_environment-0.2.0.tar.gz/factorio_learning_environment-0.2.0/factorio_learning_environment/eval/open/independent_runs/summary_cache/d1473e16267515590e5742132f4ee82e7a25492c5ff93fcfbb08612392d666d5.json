{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and transfers it to a nearby chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates, though currently not receiving iron ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Inserter Alignment and Functionality\n- Ensure that inserters are correctly aligned and positioned to transfer materials between entities. The inserter at position (-13.5, -48.5) needs to be correctly set up to transfer iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Fuel\n- Always check and ensure that all fuel-dependent entities, such as burner inserters and mining drills, have sufficient fuel to operate. Regularly refuel these entities to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Errors When Attempting to Insert Items Without Inventory\n- Before attempting to insert items into entities, verify that the required items are available in your inventory. For example, ensure coal is available before trying to refuel entities with it."}
