{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-14.0, -49.0) and (-12.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) and (-12.0, -48.0)\n- Burner Inserters at positions (-13.5, -47.5), (-14.5, -45.5), and (-13.5, -45.5)\n- Transport Belts connecting furnaces and inserters\n- Wooden Chest at position (-13.5, -46.5) and (-13.5, -44.5)\n- Iron Chest at position (-11.5, -44.5)\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-7.0, 23.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Boiler at position (-7.0, 23.5)\n- Steam Engine at position (-3.5, 23.5)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe Group connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine\n\n### Transport Belt System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Belt Group connecting various furnaces and chests\n- Transport Belts at positions (-11.5, -46.5) to (-9.5, -46.5), (-8.5, -45.5) to (-8.5, -43.5), (-16.5, -49.5) to (-16.5, -47.5), (-14.5, -45.5) to (-14.5, -47.5), (-13.5, -46.5) to (-11.5, -46.5), (-14.5, -45.5) to (-14.5, -43.5), (-13.5, -45.5) to (-11.5, -45.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Inserters are Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source items are available and reachable by the inserters to prevent them from waiting indefinitely.\n\n### Errors when Inserters are Blocked\n- Make sure there is sufficient space in the destination for inserters to place items. Clear any obstructions that might block the inserter's path.\n\n### Errors when Inserting Items with Insufficient Inventory\n- Verify that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into an entity. This will prevent insertion errors due to lack of items.\n\n### Errors when Inserters are Waiting for Space in Destination\n- Ensure that the destination has enough capacity to accept the items being transferred by the inserters. Consider using larger storage or clearing existing items to make space."}
