Verify that the targeted PipeGroup exists, is active, and that its fluid_system ID aligns with the current pipeline configuration (for example, use the working PipeGroup with fluid_system=16620).\n\n\u2022 Inefficient Pipeline Stabilization:\n  - Replace fixed 10-second wait intervals with dynamic status checks to confirm pipeline readiness before attempting reconnections, thereby reducing idle time."}
