{"content": "## Report\n\n### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Electricity Generator at Position (-7.0, 23.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (-3.5, 23.5)\n- Boiler at position (-7.0, 23.5)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe Group connecting various positions for fluid transport\n- Electricity Group with multiple poles for power distribution\n\n#### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) and (-12.0, -48.0)\n- Burner Inserters at positions (-13.5, -47.5), (-14.5, -45.5), (-13.5, -45.5), (-11.5, -45.5), (-9.5, -44.5), and (-14.5, -43.5)\n- Wooden Chests at positions (-13.5, -46.5), (-13.5, -44.5), and (-9.5, -43.5)\n- Iron Chest at position (-11.5, -44.5)\n- Belt Group connecting various positions for item transport\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors When Extracting Items\n- Ensure that the target entity (e.g., chest) contains the items you are trying to extract. Verify the inventory of the entity before attempting extraction.\n\n#### Errors Due to Full Inventory\n- Regularly check and manage your inventory space to prevent it from becoming full. Consider crafting or using items to free up space.\n\n#### Errors in Crafting Due to Concatenation Issues\n- Ensure that all variables and messages are correctly defined and initialized before concatenation operations.\n\n#### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Verify that the source entities are supplying the necessary items for inserters to operate. Check the connections and ensure that the source is not depleted.\n\n#### Output Blocked by Item on the Ground\n- Ensure that there is a destination entity available to accept the output from inserters. Clear any obstructions that may block the output path."}
