{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Crude Oil Extraction Structure at position (17.5, 40.5)\nConsists of a pumpjack at position (17.5, 40.5) and a storage tank at position (21.5, 41.5) connected via a pipe group at position (18.5, 38.5)\n\n### Electricity Generator at position (8.5, 41.5)\nConsists of \n- A boiler at position (12.5, 41.0) \n- A steam engine at position (8.5, 41.5)\n- Two offshore pumps at positions (-9.5, -0.5) and (-9.5, 1.5) connected to the boiler via pipe groups at positions (-8.5, -0.5) and (-8.5, 1.5)\n- The steam engine is connected to the pumpjack at position (17.5, 40.5) via an electricity network\n\n### Petroleum Gas Production Structure at position (26.5, 43.5)\nConsists of an oil refinery at position (26.5, 43.5), a storage tank at position (31.5, 43.5) to store petroleum gas, and a pipe group at position (18.5, 38.5) connecting the storage tank at position (21.5, 41.5) to the oil refinery.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities due to collision with existing entities or unplaceable terrain\n- Ensure that the target location is clear of other entities and is on a buildable terrain before attempting to place an entity.\n- Consider adjusting the position or direction of placement to avoid collisions.\n\n### Errors when placing entities next to other entities with specific spacing and direction\n- Verify that the spacing and direction used for placing entities next to each other are valid and do not result in collisions with existing entities.\n- Adjust the spacing or direction as needed to successfully place the entity.\n\n### Errors when connecting entities without fluid in the source entity\n- Ensure that the source entity has the required fluid before attempting to connect it to another entity that requires that fluid.\n\n### Errors when inspecting inventory of entities that do not support inventory inspection\n- Verify that the entity supports inventory inspection before attempting to inspect its inventory.\n\n### Errors when entities are not receiving electricity\n- Ensure that entities requiring electricity are properly connected to a power source.\n\n### Errors when attempting to retrieve non-existent entities\n- Verify that the entity exists at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it.\n\n### Errors due to undefined variables\n- Ensure that all variables are defined before using them in the code.\n\n### Errors when accessing non-existent attributes of objects\n- Verify that the attribute exists for the object before attempting to access it. For example, 'PipeGroup' object does not have a 'fluid' attribute.\n\n### Errors when connecting entities with incompatible fluid systems\n- Ensure that the source entity has the required fluid and is properly connected to the target entity.\n\n### Errors when connecting entities without specifying connection type\n- Specify the connection type explicitly when connecting entities to avoid inferring the wrong connection type.\n\n### Errors when using undefined names\n- Ensure that all names are defined before using them in the code.\n\n### Errors when entities are not working due to lack of input ingredients\n- Ensure that the entity has the required input ingredients before attempting to operate it.\n\n### Errors when trying to access 'fluid' attribute of 'PipeGroup' object\n- Be aware that 'PipeGroup' objects do not have a 'fluid' attribute; instead, check the fluid status within the PipeGroup object.\n\n### Errors due to NameError\n- Ensure that all variables and names are defined before using them in the code.\n\n### Errors due to invalid syntax\n- Ensure that the code is syntactically correct and does not contain any invalid characters or statements.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\nNo utility functions have been defined by the agent."}
