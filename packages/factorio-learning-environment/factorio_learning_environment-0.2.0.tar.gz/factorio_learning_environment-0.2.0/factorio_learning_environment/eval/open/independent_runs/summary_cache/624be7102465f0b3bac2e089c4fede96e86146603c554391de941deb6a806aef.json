{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Wooden Chest at position(41.5, -80.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest (position(41.5, -80.5)) with inventory containing coal.\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position(41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position(41.0, -82.0)) which is currently not collecting coal due to being out of fuel and having a full drop position.\n\n### Stone Furnace at position(-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace (position(-15.0, -50.0)) which is currently not smelting due to no ingredients available.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n- **Errors when the Burner Mining Drill is out of fuel**: Ensure that the Burner Mining Drill is regularly fueled to maintain its operation. Monitor the fuel levels and refill as necessary.\n- **Errors when the drop position is full**: The Burner Mining Drill cannot collect more resources if the drop position (Wooden Chest) is full. Regularly empty the Wooden Chest to allow continued mining.\n- **Errors when the Furnace has no ingredients**: Ensure that the Stone Furnace is supplied with the necessary ingredients to smelt. Check inventory and provide required materials.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- **Utility Functions**: \n  - `extract_from_chest(chest, item)`: Successfully extracts items from the chest unless the chest is empty.\n  - `insert_into_mining_drill(drill, fuel)`: Successfully inserts fuel into the mining drill unless the drill is already full or the chest is full.\n  \n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `coal`: int\n  - `wood`: int\n  - `iron_plate`: int\n  - `burner_mining_drill_position`: Position\n  - `wooden_chest_position`: Position\n  - `stone_furnace_position`: Position"}
