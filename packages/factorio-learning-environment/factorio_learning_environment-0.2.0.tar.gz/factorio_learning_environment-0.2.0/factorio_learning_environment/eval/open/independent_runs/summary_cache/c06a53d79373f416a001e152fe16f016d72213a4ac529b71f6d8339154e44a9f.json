{"content": "# Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) with fuel inventory of coal, working status, and connected to:\n  - **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) and another at (x=-15.5, y=-48.5) for storing mined resources.\n  - **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) transferring resources to:\n    - **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0) with coal fuel, working status, and smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n    - **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-10.0, y=-48.0) with coal fuel, currently not smelting due to lack of ingredients.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions:\n  - (x=-6.5, y=-49.5) with 1500 iron plates.\n  - (x=-6.5, y=-48.5) with 1500 iron plates.\n  - (x=-7.5, y=-48.5) with 60 iron plates.\n  - (x=-5.5, y=-48.5) with 1500 iron plates.\n  - (x=-4.5, y=-48.5) with 62 iron plates.\n  - (x=-3.5, y=-48.5) empty.\n\n### Additional Resource Handling\n- **Burner Inserters** at various positions facilitating the movement of resources between chests and furnaces, some of which are waiting for source items or space in destination.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Inserter Blockages\n- Regularly check and clear inserter drop positions to prevent blockages that halt production.\n\n### Extraction Errors\n- Verify the availability of items in the entity before attempting extraction to avoid extraction failures.\n- Ensure the correct quantity is specified for extraction based on the available inventory.\n\n### Fuel Management\n- Regularly refuel mining drills and furnaces to ensure continuous operation and avoid production halts due to lack of fuel."}
