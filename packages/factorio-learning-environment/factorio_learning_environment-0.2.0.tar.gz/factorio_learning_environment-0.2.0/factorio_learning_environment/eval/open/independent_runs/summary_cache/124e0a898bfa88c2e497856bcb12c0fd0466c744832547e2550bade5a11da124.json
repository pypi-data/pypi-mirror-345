{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nNo structures have been successfully created on the map. All attempts to place entities have failed, resulting in no entities being present on the map.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure that the tile where you are attempting to place an entity is not already occupied by another entity. This will prevent placement errors such as \"Cannot place Wooden Chest at x=0.0 y=0.0.\"\n\n### Errors related to movement\n- When moving to a new position, ensure that the coordinates are correctly formatted and accessible. Errors like \"Cannot move. string indices must be integers, not 'str'\" can occur if there is a mismatch in expected data types.\n- Verify that the path to the target position is valid and that the goal position is reachable to avoid errors like \"Could not get path from x=199.5 y=199.5 to x=400.5 y=400.0.\"\n\n### General placement errors\n- Before placing any entity, confirm that the area is buildable and that there are no restrictions or obstacles that could prevent placement. This will help in avoiding repeated placement failures across different coordinates."}
