{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -70.0) and another Stone Furnace at position (-18.0, -70.0).\n- Burner Inserter at position (-17.5, -64.5) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-16.5, -64.5) for iron plate storage.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Transport System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) connected to a series of Transport Belts leading to a Wooden Chest at position (-23.5, -69.5).\n- BeltGroup connecting various positions from (-25.5, -70.5) to (-21.5, -66.5).\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Transport System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-12.5, -54.5) via a Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5).\n\n### Miscellaneous Storage\n- Multiple Wooden Chests at various positions such as (-13.5, -61.5), (-14.5, -54.5), and (3.5, 0.5) used for storing various resources.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with BeltGroup Retrieval\n- Ensure that BeltGroups are correctly initialized and available before attempting to retrieve them. This will prevent assertion errors related to missing BeltGroups.\n\n### Errors with Connecting Entities\n- Verify that there are no gaps in the placement of transport belts. Ensure that all belts are correctly aligned and connected to avoid connectivity errors.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Operations\n- Ensure that inserters have access to source items and are correctly positioned to pick up and drop items. This will prevent inserters from waiting indefinitely for source items.\n\n### Errors with Mining Drill Fuel\n- Regularly check and refuel mining drills to prevent them from running out of fuel and halting operations.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Operations\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Regularly supply furnaces with ores to maintain continuous production."}
