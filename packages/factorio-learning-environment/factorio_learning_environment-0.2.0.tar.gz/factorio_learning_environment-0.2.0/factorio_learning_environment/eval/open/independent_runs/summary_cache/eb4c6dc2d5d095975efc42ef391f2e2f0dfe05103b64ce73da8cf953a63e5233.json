{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Boiler at position (-5.5, 24.0) with fuel inventory of 7 coal, connected to a steam engine and a small electric pole.\n- Steam Engine at position (-1.5, 24.5), currently not generating power due to connection issues.\n- Offshore Pump at position (-10.5, 25.5), supplying water through a pipe network.\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -73.0) with a fuel inventory of 8 coal, currently not smelting due to lack of ingredients.\n- Stone Furnace at position (9.0, -64.0) with a fuel inventory of 16 coal, currently not smelting due to lack of ingredients.\n- Stone Furnace at position (6.0, -62.0) with a fuel inventory of 35 coal, currently not smelting due to lack of ingredients.\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) not operational due to lack of power, intended to transfer items to/from the stone furnace.\n- Wooden Chest at position (7.5, -61.5) and another at (6.5, -59.5) for storing materials.\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- PipeGroup at position (-5.5, 26.5) with pipes extending to (-3.5, 27.5), currently empty.\n- PipeGroup at position (-10.5, 24.5) carrying water, fully operational.\n\n### Electricity Networks\n- ElectricityGroup with ID 91187, covering positions from (4.5, -62.5) to (7.5, -60.5), currently without voltage.\n- ElectricityGroup with ID 91197, spanning multiple positions, currently without voltage.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Connecting Steam Engine to Power Network\n- Ensure all necessary connections are established between the steam engine and the power network. Check for missing pipes or poles that may prevent the steam engine from receiving water or connecting to the power grid.\n\n### Errors in Pipe Connectivity\n- Verify that pipes are correctly placed and connected to transport fluids between entities. Avoid blockages by ensuring there is a clear path for the fluid to flow.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Power\n- Make sure that all electrical entities, such as inserters and labs, are connected to a functioning power network. Check the connections and ensure that the power source is active and capable of supplying electricity.\n\n### Errors in Furnace Operation\n- Ensure that all furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Regularly check the inventory and supply chain to prevent production halts due to missing materials."}
