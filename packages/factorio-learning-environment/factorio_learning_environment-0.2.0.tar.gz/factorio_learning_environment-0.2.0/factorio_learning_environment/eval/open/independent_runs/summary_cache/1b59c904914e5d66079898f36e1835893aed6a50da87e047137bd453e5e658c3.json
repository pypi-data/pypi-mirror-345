Ensure there is enough space around inserters for them to rotate and transfer items.\n- The inserter at (40.5, -80.5) is blocked by a transport belt at (39.5, -80.5). Ensure there is no overlap between entities when placing them.\n\n### Errors related to inserter fuel\n- The inserter at (40.5, -80.5) already has fuel. Check the inserter's inventory before attempting to insert fuel.\n\n### Insufficient resources\n- The agent does not have enough iron ore in its inventory. Ensure that you have enough resources in your inventory before attempting to craft or build.\n- The agent does not have enough wooden chests in its inventory.
