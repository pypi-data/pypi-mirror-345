{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (x=41.0, y=-82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=40.5, y=-83.5) for coal storage.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=41.5, y=-83.5) transferring coal from a Wooden Chest at position (x=42.5, y=-83.5) to another Wooden Chest at position (x=40.5, y=-83.5).\n\n### Stone Furnace Setup for Smelting at Position (x=61.0, y=-54.0) and (x=64.0, y=-53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=61.0, y=-54.0) with a Burner Inserter at position (x=61.5, y=-55.5) for coal input.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=64.0, y=-53.0) with a Burner Inserter at position (x=64.5, y=-54.5) for coal input.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=61.5, y=-52.5) for storing smelted products and other items.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting belts directly to furnaces\n- Ensure that belts are not directly connected to furnaces. Use an inserter to input items into a furnace.\n\n### Errors when placing entities too far from the player\n- Move closer to the target position before attempting to place an entity. The maximum placement distance is 10 units.\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Check that the target tile is unoccupied before placing an entity to avoid placement errors.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `connect_entities(belt_start_position, inserter_1.pickup_position, Prototype.TransportBelt)`: This function attempts to connect a belt to an inserter. Ensure that the connection is valid and does not attempt to connect directly to a furnace.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `belt_to_inserter_1`: Represents the connection between a belt and an inserter. Ensure this is correctly defined and used.\n- `inserter_1_position`: Position variable for placing an inserter. Ensure the position is within the allowable range from the player's current position."}
