{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nConsists of three stone furnaces in a row:\n- Furnace 1 at position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Furnace 2 at position (2.0, 0.0)  \n- Furnace 3 at position (4.0, 4.0)\n\n### Electronic Circuit Production Line\nLocated around position (9.5, 11.5), consists of:\n- Input wooden chest at position (6.5, 11.5)\n- Burner inserter at position (7.5, 11.5) moving items from input chest to assembler\n- Assembling machine at position (9.5, 11.5) crafting electronic circuits\n- Burner inserter at position (11.5, 11.5) moving finished products\n- Output wooden chest at position (12.5, 11.5) storing completed circuits\n\n### Power Generation System\nLocated around position (-7.0, 24.5), consists of:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, 24.5) providing water\n- Pipe network connecting pump to boiler:\n  - Pipes at (-9.5, 23.5), (-8.5, 23.5), (-8.5, 22.5), (-7.5, 22.5)\n- Boiler at position (-7.0, 24.5) generating steam\n- Steam pipe at position (-5.5, 24.5)\n- Steam engine at position (-2.5, 24.5) generating electricity\n- Electricity distribution network with multiple poles around positions (4.5, 8.5), (6.5, 1.5), (4.5, 16.5), etc.\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied positions\n- Check if target position is already occupied before placing new entities\n- Remove existing entities if you need to place something in their position\n- This occurred when trying to place a lab at position (0.5, 28.5)\n\n### Errors with entity retrieval\n- Ensure the entity exists at the target position before trying to get it\n- Verify the correct prototype and position when using get_entity()\n- This occurred when trying to get lab at position (0.5, 28.5)\n\n### Errors with item insertion\n- Check inventory has sufficient items before attempting to insert them\n- This occurred when trying to insert coal into boiler with empty coal inventory"}
