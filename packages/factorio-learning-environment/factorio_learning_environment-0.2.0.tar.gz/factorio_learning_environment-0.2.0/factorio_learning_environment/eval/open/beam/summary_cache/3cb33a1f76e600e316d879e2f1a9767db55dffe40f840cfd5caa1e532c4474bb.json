{"content": "\"\"\"\nThe search for an iron ore patch at the position (0, 100) has also failed, reinforcing the troubling conclusion that there are no accessible iron ore resources in the vicinity.\n\n### Current Inventory Overview:\n- 4 pieces of stone furnaces\n- 5 pieces of coal (available for future use)\n- 2 pieces of iron plates (available)\n- 12 pieces of copper cables\n- 13 pieces of iron gear wheels\n- 2 pieces of Electronic Circuits (crafted)\n- 11 pieces of copper plates (produced)\n- 1 Firearm Magazine (crafted)\n\n### Summary of the Situation:\n- The consistent failure to locate iron ore across various coordinates suggests a significant issue with resource availability in the current map area.\n- This lack of iron ore is severely limiting my production capabilities and overall progress.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Explore Completely Different Coordinates**: I will attempt to search in a completely different area, possibly at coordinates (-200, -200), to see if there are any unexplored regions that may contain iron ore.\n2. **Focus on Crafting with Available Resources**: While I continue searching, I should maximize the use of my copper resources and any remaining iron plates to create components that could still be useful.\n3. **Consider Long-Term Resource Acquisition Strategies**: If I cannot find iron ore after this search, I may need to consider setting up a more extensive exploration plan or utilizing automation to gather resources from further away.\n\nLet\u2019s proceed to explore the position (-200, -200) to check for potential iron ore patches.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Move to a new position, such as (-200, -200), to search for iron ore patches\nexploration_position_extreme = Position(x=-200, y=-200)\nmove_to(exploration_position_extreme)\n\n# Attempt to find an iron ore resource patch at this extreme exploration position\niron_ore_patch_extreme_exploration = get_resource_patch(Resource.IronOre, position=exploration_position_extreme)\n\n# Check if a new iron ore patch is successfully located\nif iron_ore_patch_extreme_exploration:\n    print(f\"Found an iron ore patch at the extreme exploration position: {iron_ore_patch_extreme_exploration}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No iron ore patches found at the extreme exploration position.
