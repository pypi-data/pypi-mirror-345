{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -48.0 to -11.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -48.0) with coal as fuel, currently lacking iron ore for smelting.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0) with coal as fuel, currently lacking iron ore for smelting.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0) with coal as fuel, currently lacking iron ore for smelting.\n\n### Iron Ore Extraction and Storage Facility at Position (4.0, -60.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (4.0, -60.0) extracting iron ore, with a warning that the chest at drop position is full.\n- Wooden Chest at position (4.5, -58.5) storing extracted iron ore.\n- Multiple Wooden Chests at positions (5.5, -60.5), (7.5, -60.5), (6.5, -60.5), (9.5, -60.5), and (8.5, -60.5) for additional storage.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chests at positions (-14.5, -50.5), (-13.5, -50.5), (-12.5, -50.5), (-11.5, -50.5), (-10.5, -50.5), (-9.5, -50.5), (-8.5, -50.5), (-7.5, -50.5), and (-6.5, -50.5) storing iron plates, with some chests full and issuing warnings.\n- Iron Chests at positions (-6.5, -50.5) and (-5.5, -50.5) storing additional iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Insufficient Inventory for Insertion\n- Ensure that the required items are available in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. For example, the attempt to insert coal into the drill failed due to a lack of coal in the inventory.\n\n### Errors Due to Full Storage\n- Regularly check and empty storage chests to prevent them from becoming full, which can halt production processes. The chest at position (4.5, -58.5) is full, preventing further iron ore extraction.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces have a continuous supply of raw materials (iron ore) to maintain production efficiency. The furnaces at positions (-15.0, -48.0), (-13.0, -48.0), and (-11.0, -48.0) are currently lacking iron ore.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `insert_item(item_type: Prototype, target_entity, quantity: int)`: Attempts to insert a specified quantity of an item into a target entity. Failure occurs if the item is not present in the inventory.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `inventory: dict`: A dictionary representing the current inventory, e.g., `{'wood': 10, 'iron-plate': 3719, 'iron-gear-wheel': 4}`.\n- `coal_to_insert: int`: The quantity of coal intended for insertion into entities, which should be checked against available inventory."}
