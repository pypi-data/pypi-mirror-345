Ensure all required sub-ingredients and raw resources are available before initiating a craft.\n\n\u2022 Entity Placement and Collision Issues  \n\u2003\u2013 Attempts to place Small Electric Poles near the Assembling Machine failed when placement zones were obstructed \u2013 either by an existing pole (e.g. at (4.5, 6.5)), by nearby furnaces (notably one at (6, 7)), or by other entities. Verify that target tiles are clear and adjust spacing, direction, or reference positions to avoid collisions.\n\n\u2022 Power Network Connection Errors  \n\u2003\u2013 Connections between the Steam Engine and the Assembling Machine have failed due to an insufficient number of Small Electric Poles in inventory and improper chaining of placements. Check inventory for the required number of poles and verify that placements form a continuous, unbroken power network.\n\n\u2022 Function and Type Usage Errors  \n\u2003\u2013 A TypeError occurred when a Position object was mistakenly treated as a callable function (e.g. mid_pole_pos = buildable_area.center() triggered a 'Position' object is not callable error). Ensure that properties of position objects are accessed correctly without invoking them as functions.\n\n\u2022 Underground Fluid Connection Failures  \n\u2003\u2013 Ensure both source and target connection points are unobstructed and configured with matching fluid flow parameters. Adjust layouts to ease congestion near critical connection zones.\n\n\u2022 Offshore Pump and Electronic Component Crafting Failures  \n\u2003\u2013 Verify that all sub-ingredients are adequately available to support downstream production, consolidating resource flows to avoid missing ingredient errors.\n\n\u2022 Repositioning and Buildable Area Computation Errors  \n\u2003\u2013 Ensure that computed buildable areas fall within the maximum placement distance. Moving closer to the target area center can prevent out-of-range errors.\n\n\u2022 Resource Insertion and Availability Issues  \n\u2003\u2013 Confirm that required entities are present in inventory before placement attempts; craft new units if they are absent.\n\n\u2022 Fuel and Resource Insertion Issues  \n\u2003\u2013 Monitor resource levels closely and replenish critical inputs (such as fuel and raw materials) to sustain continuous production operations.\n\n\u2022 Component Extraction Failures  \n\u2003\u2013 Repeated failures to extract products from the Assembling Machine indicate that production may be halted. Confirm that processing cycles are complete and that valid outputs are available before extraction.\n\n\u2022 Assembler Production and Power Connection Issues  \n\u2003\u2013 The Assembling Machine\u2019s persistent NO_POWER status, despite multiple connection attempts, suggests that its power network is not robust. Verify that the assembler is connected to a continuous chain of power sources and that all required inputs are properly supplied.\n\n\u2022 Removal Operation and Relocation Computation Errors  \n\u2003\u2013 Verify entity existence and proper data type handling during removals or positional computations to avoid type-related failures."}
