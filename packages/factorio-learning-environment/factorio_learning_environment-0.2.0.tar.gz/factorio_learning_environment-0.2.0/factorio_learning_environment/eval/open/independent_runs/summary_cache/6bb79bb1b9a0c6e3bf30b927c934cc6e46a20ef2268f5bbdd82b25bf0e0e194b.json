{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Two Stone Furnaces at positions (x=1.0, y=1.0) and (x=3.0, y=1.0) with inserters positioned to refuel and extract products.\n- Burner Inserters at positions (x=1.5, y=-0.5), (x=3.5, y=-0.5), (x=-0.5, y=1.5), (x=1.5, y=2.5), and (x=3.5, y=2.5) for moving items in and out of the furnaces.\n- A BeltGroup connecting the iron ore supply to the inserters at positions (x=1.5, y=3.5) and (x=3.5, y=3.5), facilitating the transportation of iron ore to the furnaces.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting belts to furnaces\n- Ensure you use an inserter to connect belts to furnaces. Belts cannot be connected directly to a Stone Furnace.\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied tiles\n- Verify that the target tile is unoccupied before placing an entity. Adjust spacing or change direction if necessary to avoid overlap with existing entities.\n\n### Errors in creating valid belt paths\n- Check the path for belt connections to ensure it is valid and unobstructed. Adjust the path or remove obstacles to establish a proper connection.\n\n### Errors due to inserters being out of fuel\n- Regularly refuel inserters to maintain their operation and prevent production halts. \n\n### Errors in belt normalization\n- Ensure the belt path is continuous and does not have gaps or invalid segments that could disrupt the flow of materials."}
