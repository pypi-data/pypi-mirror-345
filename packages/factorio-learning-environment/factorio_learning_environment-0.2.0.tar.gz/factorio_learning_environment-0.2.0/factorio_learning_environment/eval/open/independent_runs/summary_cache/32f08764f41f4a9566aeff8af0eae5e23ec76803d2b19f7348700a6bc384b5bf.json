Verify alignment and remove obstructions before attempting reconnection.\n  - Double-check that any manual pipe chain spans the proper connection endpoints so that the fluid source and target expect the same fluid type.\n\n- Entity Repositioning & Placement:\n  - Validate that repositioned entities are being placed within a buildable area and within the allowed placement distance; if not, move the player closer to the target location.\n  - Confirm correct handling and referencing of positional objects to avoid errors such as \"'Position' object is not callable\" or attempting to update attributes of a non-existent (NoneType) entity.\n\n- Fluid Network Integration:\n  - Ensure that the fluid type present in a pipe group matches the expected input of connected machines. Mismatches in fluid types can prevent proper connection and fluid flow.\n  - Prior to extending a pipe network, verify that an initial pipe group exists near the source (boiler) to serve as a reliable starting point for further connections."}
