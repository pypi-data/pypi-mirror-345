{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(2.5, 2.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Small electric pole (position 2.5, 2.5) - Status: NOT_PLUGGED_IN_ELECTRIC_NETWORK\n\n### Lab at position(6.5, 6.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab (position 6.5, 6.5) - Status: NO_POWER, requires automation science packs to complete research.\n\n### Furnace setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace (position 0.0, 0.0) - Status: NO_INGREDIENTS, currently has 8 iron plates.\n- Furnace (position 2.0, 0.0) - Status: NO_INGREDIENTS, currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n- Wooden chest (position 3.5, 0.5) - Status: NORMAL, currently empty.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to electricity\n- Ensure that electric poles are connected to the electric network to avoid the NOT_PLUGGED_IN_ELECTRIC_NETWORK status. Check the positioning and connections of poles.\n\n### Errors when accessing entities\n- Ensure that the entity you are trying to access (e.g., Lab) exists at the specified position before attempting to interact with it. The error indicates that no lab was found at position (0, 1).\n\n### Errors when inserting items\n- The lab's inventory is full, which prevents the insertion of automation science packs. Check the lab's inventory capacity and ensure it has space before attempting to insert items.\n\n### Repeated errors\n- The same errors regarding the lab not being found and the inability to insert items into the lab have occurred multiple times. Review the positions and inventory management to avoid these repeated issues."}
