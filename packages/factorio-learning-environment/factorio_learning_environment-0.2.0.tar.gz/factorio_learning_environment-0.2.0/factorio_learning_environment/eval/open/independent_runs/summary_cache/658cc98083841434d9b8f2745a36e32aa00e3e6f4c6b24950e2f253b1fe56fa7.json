{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (52.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (52.0, -82.0) extracting coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (53.5, -80.5) storing extracted coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (52.5, -79.5) transferring coal from the chest at (53.5, -80.5) to another chest at (52.5, -78.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -78.5) storing transferred coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (52.5, -76.5) waiting for source items to transfer.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-12.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-12.0, -51.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-11.5, -49.5) storing extracted iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) processing iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-11.5, -48.5) waiting for source items to transfer.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-8.5, -48.5) waiting for source items to transfer.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -46.5) waiting for source items to transfer.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-13.5, -45.5) currently empty.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entities (e.g., chests or belts) have items available for the inserters to transfer. Check for blockages or missing items in the supply chain.\n\n### Chest Full Warning\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are at capacity to prevent interruptions in mining operations. Specifically, the chest at (-11.5, -49.5) needs to be emptied to continue mining operations.\n\n### Furnace No Ingredients Warning\n- Ensure that the furnace has a continuous supply of raw materials to process. The stone furnace at (-14.0, -49.0) is currently lacking ingredients to smelt.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined by the agent in the provided logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Current inventory containing items such as 'wooden-chest', 'wood', 'coal', 'iron-ore', and 'iron-plate'."}
