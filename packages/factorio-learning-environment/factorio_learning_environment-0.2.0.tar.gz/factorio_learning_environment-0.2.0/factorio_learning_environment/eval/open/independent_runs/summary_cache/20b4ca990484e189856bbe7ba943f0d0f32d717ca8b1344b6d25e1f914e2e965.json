{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -49.0) which is actively working. It is fueled by coal and processes iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Coal Mining and Transport System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (42.0, -83.0) which is currently out of fuel and has its output blocked.\n- Burner Inserter at position (42.5, -81.5) which is waiting for source items and is connected to the mining drill and transport belts.\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (42.5, -82.5) to (44.5, -82.5) and (43.5, -81.5) to (43.5, -79.5), facilitating the movement of mined resources.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Wooden Chests\n- Ensure that the intended position for placing a wooden chest is clear of any obstructions or existing entities before attempting placement.\n\n### Errors when Extending Transport Belts\n- Verify that the intended path for extending transport belts is unobstructed and that there is sufficient space for the extension.\n\n### Fuel and Output Blockage in Mining Drills\n- Regularly refuel mining drills to maintain operation.\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity in place to accept the output from mining drills to prevent blockage.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Check that the source entities are actively producing items and that there are no blockages preventing the flow of items to the inserter."}
