{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Smelting Facility at Position (-15.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -49.0) which is actively smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Coal Mining and Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (40.0, -84.0) extracting coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (40.5, -82.5) storing extracted coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -83.5) for additional storage.\n- Burner Inserter at position (54.5, -83.5) transferring items between chests.\n- BeltGroup with belts connecting various positions to facilitate coal movement.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Iron Chest at position (0.5, 0.5) storing iron plates.\n- Iron Chest at position (1.5, 0.5) for additional storage.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Attribute Errors in Code\n- Ensure that the variables used in the code are of the correct type and have the necessary attributes. For instance, when accessing attributes like `position`, ensure the variable is an object with such attributes.\n\n### Extraction Errors\n- Before attempting to extract items from an entity, confirm that the entity has sufficient items to fulfill the extraction request. Adjust the quantity to match the available items.\n\n### Inventory Full Errors\n- Regularly monitor and manage inventory space to prevent it from becoming full. Transfer excess items to storage chests to free up space.\n\n### Harvesting Errors Due to Full Inventory\n- Ensure that there is adequate space in the inventory before attempting to harvest resources. Transfer items to storage if necessary to create space.\n\n### Inserter and Chest Management\n- Ensure that chests connected to inserters are not full to allow continuous operation. Regularly remove items from chests to maintain workflow efficiency."}
