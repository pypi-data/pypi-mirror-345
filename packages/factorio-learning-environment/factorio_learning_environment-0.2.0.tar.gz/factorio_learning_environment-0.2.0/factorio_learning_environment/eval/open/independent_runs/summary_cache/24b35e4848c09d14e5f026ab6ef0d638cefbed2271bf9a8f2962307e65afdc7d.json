{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Automation Science Pack Production Line (around x=8.5, y=13.5)\nConsists of following entities:\n- Assembling machine-1 at (x=8.5, y=13.5)\n- Iron gear inserter at (x=6.5, y=13.5)\n- Output inserter at (x=10.5, y=13.5)\n- Output chest at (x=11.5, y=13.5)\n- Iron gear inserter at (x=8.5, y=11.5)\n- Iron gear chest at (x=8.5, y=10.5)\n- Transport belt system connecting components\n\n### Power Generation System (around x=-4.5, y=12.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam engine at (x=-4.5, y=12.5)\n- Boiler at (x=-4.5, y=16.0)\n- Offshore pump at (x=-3.5, y=27.5)\n- Connected pipe networks for water and steam transport\n- Electrical network with multiple poles covering the production area\n\n### Mining and Smelting Setups\nMultiple setups consisting of:\n1. Setup at (x=41.0, y=-82.0):\n- Burner mining drill\n- Wooden chest at (x=41.5, y=-80.5)\n- Burner inserter at (x=41.5, y=-79.5)\n\n2. Setup at (x=-28.0, y=-61.0):\n- Burner mining drill\n- Wooden chest at (x=-27.5, y=-59.5)\n- Burner inserter at (x=-26.5, y=-59.5)\n- Stone furnace at (x=-25.0, y=-59.0)\n- Output chest at (x=-22.5, y=-58.5)\n- Output inserter at (x=-23.5, y=-58.5)\n\n3. Setup at (x=-18.0, y=-53.0):\n- Burner mining drill\n- Wooden chest at (x=-17.5, y=-51.5)\n- Burner inserter at (x=-16.5, y=-51.5)\n- Stone furnace at (x=-15.0, y=-51.0)\n- Output chest at (x=-12.5, y=-50.5)\n- Output inserter at (x=-13.5, y=-50.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Collision Errors\n- Check for existing entities before placing new ones - common collisions with:\n  - Transport belts\n  - Electric poles\n  - Wooden chests\n  - Stone furnaces\n- Increase spacing or change direction when placing entities near existing structures\n- Consider the full tile dimensions of larger entities like assembling machines and furnaces\n\n### Entity Positioning Strategy\n- Plan the layout considering the space needed for all components before placing them\n- Leave adequate space between production lines and components\n- Consider the direction of inserters and belts when planning chest and machine placement\n\n### Power System Issues\n- Ensure boilers are properly fueled to maintain power supply\n- Monitor power consumption and generation capacity\n\n### Production Line Setup\n- Verify all components (inserters, chests, machines) are properly connected\n- Ensure proper spacing for input/output logistics\n- Plan for adequate material flow paths between components"}
