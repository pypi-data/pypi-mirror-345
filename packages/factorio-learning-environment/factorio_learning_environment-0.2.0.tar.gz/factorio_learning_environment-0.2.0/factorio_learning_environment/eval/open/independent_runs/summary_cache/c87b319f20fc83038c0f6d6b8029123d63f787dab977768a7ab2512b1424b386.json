{"content": "I'll create a report based on the provided execution logs.\n\n# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Transport System (around x=41, y=-82)\nComplex system for mining and transporting coal consisting of:\n- Burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0) facing DOWN\n- Storage chest (iron-chest) at (41.5, -83.5) containing 1600 coal\n- Wooden chest at (41.5, -80.5) containing 347 coal\n- Transport belt at (42.5, -80.5) facing RIGHT\n- Burner inserter at (43.5, -80.5) facing RIGHT, picks up from belt (42.5, -80.5) and drops at (44.5, -80.5)\n\n### Furnace System (around x=45, y=-81)\nTwo furnaces for smelting:\n- Stone furnace at (45.0, -81.0)\n- Stone furnace at (47.0, -81.0)\nBoth furnaces currently have no ingredients but contain 50 coal as fuel\n\n### Storage System\n- Wooden chest at (49.5, -80.5) containing 1500 iron plates\n\n### Belt Transport System\n- Belt group running from (42.5, -68.5) to (42.5, -77.5)\n- Additional belts at:\n  - (42.5, -80.5) facing RIGHT\n  - (42.5, -79.5) facing DOWN\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Conflicts\n- Multiple attempts to place burner-inserter failed due to existing objects in the way at positions:\n  - (42.5, -79.5)\n  - (41.5, -81.5)\n  - (41.5, -81.5)\n- Before placing entities, check if the target location is clear of other objects\n- Consider implementing a position validation check before attempting placement\n\n### System Design Issues\n- The coal transport system shows signs of inefficient placement with multiple removal and replacement of chest inserters\n- Plan the entire layout before placing components to avoid constant adjustments\n- Ensure proper alignment of inserters with their source and destination positions\n\n# NAMESPACE\n\n### Important Variables\n- `chest_inserter`: EntityType.BURNER_INSERTER\n- `mining_drill`: EntityType.BURNER_MINING_DRILL\n- `coal_chest`: EntityType.CHEST\n- `furnace`: EntityType.FURNACE\n- `belt`: EntityType.TRANSPORT_BELT\n\n### System States\nThe code tracks various entity states including:\n- EntityStatus.WORKING\n- EntityStatus.WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS\n- EntityStatus.WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION\n- EntityStatus.NO_INGREDIENTS\n- EntityStatus.NORMAL"}
