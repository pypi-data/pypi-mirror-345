The error \"Cannot place pipe at the target location - something is in the way\" indicates obstruction.\n\n### Boiler Connection Errors\n- Verify that the boiler is properly connected to the water source. The status \"Boiler is still not connected to the water source\" suggests a connection issue. Ensure all necessary pipes are correctly placed and connected.\n\n### Power Supply Issues\n- Check that all entities requiring power are connected to a functioning power network. The status \"not receiving electricity\" indicates a lack of power supply, which may be due to disconnected or unpowered electric poles."}
