{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Iron Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) fueled with coal, processing iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (2.5, 0.5) used for storing processed items.\n- Burner Inserter at position (1.5, 0.5) transferring items from the furnace to the chest.\n- Transport Belt from position (3.5, 0.5) to (5.5, 0.5) moving items to further processing.\n- Burner Inserter at position (3.5, 0.5) waiting for source items, connected to the transport belt.\n\n### Copper Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Copper Furnace at position (10.0, 0.0) fueled with coal, processing copper ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (8.5, 0.5) transferring items from the chest to the furnace.\n- Wooden Chest at position (7.5, 0.5) used for storing processed items.\n- Burner Inserter at position (11.5, 0.5) waiting for source items to transfer to the next stage.\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) extracting coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (40.5, -83.5) storing extracted coal.\n- Transport Belt from position (40.5, -83.5) to (38.5, -83.5) moving coal to storage.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when attempting to extract or insert items\n- Ensure the target entity contains the required items before attempting to extract or insert. Verify that the inventory is not empty.\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Confirm that there is sufficient space and no existing objects at the target location before placing a new entity. Check inventory to ensure the entity is available for placement.\n\n### Errors with inserters waiting for source items\n- Make sure the source entity has items available for the inserter to transfer. Regularly check and restock source inventories to prevent idle inserters.\n\n### Errors due to full inventory\n- Regularly monitor and manage inventories to prevent overflow. Ensure there is enough space in the destination entity before transferring items.\n\n### Errors with blocked paths or destinations\n- Ensure that the path or destination for item transfer is clear and not obstructed by other entities. Regularly check and clear any blockages to maintain smooth operation.\n\n### Errors with missing entities at specified positions\n- Verify the presence of entities at specified positions before attempting operations like insertion or extraction. Use the map data to confirm entity locations.\n\n### Errors when attempting to place entities on occupied tiles\n- Always check if the tile is free before placing an entity to avoid conflicts with existing structures."}
