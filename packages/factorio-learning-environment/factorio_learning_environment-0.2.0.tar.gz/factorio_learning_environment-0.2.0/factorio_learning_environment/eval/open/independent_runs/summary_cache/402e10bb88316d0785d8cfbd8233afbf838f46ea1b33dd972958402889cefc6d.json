This will prevent errors like \"No iron-ore to insert from your inventory\" or \"No coal to insert from your inventory.\"\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Before placing an entity, verify that the target tile is unoccupied. This will help avoid errors such as \"Could not place wooden-chest at (-28.5, -62.5), as there is an existing object in the way.\"\n\n### Errors with connecting entities without required items\n- Make sure you have the necessary items in your inventory to connect entities, such as transport belts. This will prevent errors like \"Could not connect transport-belt from x=-28.0 y=-61.0 to x=-28.5 y=-62.5. You do not have the required item in their inventory.\""}
