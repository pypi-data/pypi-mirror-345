{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-9.5, 24.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5) - Status: WORKING\n- Steam Engine at position (-5.5, 19.5) - Status: NOT_CONNECTED\n- Boiler at position (-2.5, 24.0) - Status: NOT_CONNECTED\n- Pipe Groups connecting various positions:\n  - Pipe Group at position (-4.5, 16.5) - Status: EMPTY\n  - Pipe Group at position (-9.5, 23.5) - Status: FULL_OUTPUT\n  - Pipe Group at position (-7.5, 24.5) - Status: EMPTY\n  - Pipe Group at position (-4.5, 24.5) - Status: EMPTY\n\n### Stone Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Stone Furnace - Status: NO_INGREDIENTS/WORKING (varies across steps)\n\n### Electricity Network\n- Electricity Group at position (-3.6666666666666665, 20.214285714285715) - Status: NOT_PLUGGED_IN_ELECTRIC_NETWORK\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors When Placing Pipes or Pipe-to-Ground\n- Ensure that the target location for placing pipes or pipe-to-ground does not overlap with water or other entities. Consider repositioning the pipes to a suitable location.\n\n### Errors Due to Missing Inventory Items\n- Before attempting to place or craft items, verify that the required items are available in the inventory. For example, ensure you have enough pipes or iron plates before crafting or placing.\n\n### Errors with Entity Connections\n- Make sure that all entities such as steam engines and boilers are properly connected to the network to function correctly.\n\n### Errors in Crafting Due to Missing Ingredients\n- Ensure that all necessary ingredients are available before attempting to craft items. For example, iron plates are required for crafting certain items and should be smelted in a furnace if not available.\n\n### API Misuse Errors\n- Correctly use API attributes and methods. For instance, ensure that the correct attribute names are used, such as 'PipeGroup' instead of 'PipeToGround'.\n\n### Assertion Errors Due to Resource Availability\n- Verify that resources like iron ore are available before attempting operations that require them, such as smelting.\n\n### Type Errors in Function Arguments\n- Ensure that function arguments are of the correct type. For example, when using functions that require numerical inputs, ensure that the inputs are not of incompatible types like 'ModelPrivateAttr'."}
