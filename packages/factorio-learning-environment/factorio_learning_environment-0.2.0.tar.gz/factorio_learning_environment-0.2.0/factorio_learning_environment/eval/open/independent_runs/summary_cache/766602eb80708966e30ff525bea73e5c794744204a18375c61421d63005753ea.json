{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) for iron ore extraction.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=41.0, y=-80.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0) connected to a Stone Furnace at position (x=-20.0, y=-71.0) for copper ore extraction and smelting into copper plates.\n\n### Storage Facility\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=43.5, y=-79.5) for storing items.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Insufficient Inventory for Insertion\n- Ensure that you have enough coal in your inventory before attempting to insert it into furnaces or drills. This error occurred multiple times when trying to insert coal into the iron and copper furnaces.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `insert_item`: This function is used to insert items into entities such as furnaces and drills. It failed when there was insufficient coal in the inventory.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `iron_furnace`: Represents the iron furnace entity.\n- `copper_furnace`: Represents the copper furnace entity."}
