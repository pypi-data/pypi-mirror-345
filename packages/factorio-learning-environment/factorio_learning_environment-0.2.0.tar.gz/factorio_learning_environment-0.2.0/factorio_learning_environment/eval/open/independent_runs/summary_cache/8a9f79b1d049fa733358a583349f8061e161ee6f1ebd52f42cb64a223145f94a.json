{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage at Position (x=53.0, y=-83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=53.0, y=-83.0) supplying coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=52.5, y=-84.5) storing coal.\n\n### Iron Plate Production at Position (x=-20.0, y=-70.0) and (x=-18.0, y=-70.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-20.0, y=-70.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-18.0, y=-70.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-23.5, y=-69.5) storing copper ore.\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-23.0, y=-68.0) extracting copper ore.\n- Transport belts connecting the mining drill to the chest and furnaces.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Transport at Position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Transport belts connecting the mining drill to a wooden chest at position (x=-12.5, y=-54.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-12.5, y=-54.5) storing iron ore.\n\n### Iron Plate Production and Storage at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=1.5, y=0.5) storing coal, iron ore, and iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=2.5, y=0.5) waiting for source items.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=3.5, y=0.5) empty.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using BeltGroup object\n- Ensure that the BeltGroup object has the correct attributes. The error indicates that 'BeltGroup' object has no attribute 'direction'. Verify the BeltGroup class definition and ensure that all necessary attributes are correctly implemented.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the inserters have access to source items. The inserters at positions (x=-20.5, y=-66.5) and (x=2.5, y=0.5) are waiting for source items. Check the supply lines and ensure that the inserters are positioned correctly to pick up items from the belts or chests.\n\n### No Ingredients to Smelt in Furnaces\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. The furnaces at positions (x=-20.0, y=-70.0), (x=-18.0, y=-70.0), and (x=0.0, y=0.0) are reporting no ingredients to smelt. Verify the supply of raw materials to these furnaces and adjust the transport belts or inserters accordingly."}
