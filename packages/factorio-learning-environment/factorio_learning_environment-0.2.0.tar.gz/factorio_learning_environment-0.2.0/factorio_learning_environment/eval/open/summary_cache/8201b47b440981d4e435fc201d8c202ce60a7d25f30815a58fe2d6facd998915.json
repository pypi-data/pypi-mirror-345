{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron plate production setup at position (16.0, 71.0)\nConsists of the following entities working together to mine and smelt iron ore into iron plates:\n- Burner mining drill at position (16.0, 71.0) facing down, extracting iron ore.\n- Stone furnace at position (16.0, 73.0) facing up, smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden chest at position (17.5, 73.5) collecting iron plates from the furnace.\n- Burner inserter at position (18.5, 73.5) facing right, transferring iron plates from the furnace to the wooden chest.\n\nThis structure forms a compact iron plate production line with direct output storage.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors placing inserters adjacent to occupied tiles\n- When placing an inserter next to another entity (e.g., wooden chest), ensure the target tile for the inserter is free. If placement fails due to collision, try increasing spacing, changing the inserter\u2019s facing direction, or adjusting the reference position.\n- Before placing an entity, check for existing entities in the intended tile to avoid placement conflicts.\n\n### Inserter waiting for source items despite fuel and operational status\n- Inserters may show \"waiting for source items\" if the source container (e.g., furnace output) is empty or not producing items yet.\n- Ensure the furnace has input materials and is actively producing output before expecting the inserter to operate.\n- Confirm that the mining drill is outputting ore into the furnace to maintain continuous production.\n\n### Output blocked warning on mining drill\n- The burner mining drill shows \"output blocked by item on the ground\" warning indicating no entity is currently accepting its output.\n- To resolve, ensure the furnace or another entity is correctly positioned to receive ore from the drill\u2019s output position.\n- Verify inserter placement and connections to prevent output blockage.\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nNo user-defined functions have been defined in the provided steps."}
