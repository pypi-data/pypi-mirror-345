{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Automation Science Pack Production Setup at (8.5, 13.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine-1 at (8.5, 13.5)\n- Input inserter for copper plates at (6.5, 13.5)\n- Input inserter for iron gears at (8.5, 11.5)\n- Output inserter at (10.5, 13.5)\n- Copper plate input chest at (6.5, 14.5)\n- Iron gear input chest at (8.5, 10.5)\n- Output chest at (11.5, 13.5)\n- Electric pole at (8.5, 17.5)\n- Transport belt system connecting components\n\n### Power Generation System at (-4.5, 12.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam engine at (-4.5, 12.5)\n- Boiler at (-4.5, 16.0)\n- Offshore pump at (-3.5, 27.5)\n- Pipe networks connecting water and steam\n- Electric pole network connecting power to other structures\n\n### Mining and Smelting Operations\nMultiple mining and smelting setups at different locations:\n1. Setup at (41.0, -82.0):\n   - Burner mining drill\n   - Output chest at (41.5, -80.5)\n   - Inserter at (41.5, -79.5)\n\n2. Setup at (-28.0, -61.0):\n   - Burner mining drill\n   - Output chest at (-27.5, -59.5)\n   - Inserter at (-26.5, -59.5)\n   - Stone furnace at (-25.0, -59.0)\n   - Output chest at (-22.5, -58.5)\n   - Output inserter at (-23.5, -58.5)\n\n3. Setup at (-18.0, -53.0):\n   - Burner mining drill\n   - Output chest at (-17.5, -51.5)\n   - Inserter at (-16.5, -51.5)\n   - Stone furnace at (-15.0, -51.0)\n   - Output chest at (-12.5, -50.5)\n   - Output inserter at (-13.5, -50.5)\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Conflicts\n- Check for existing entities before placing new ones at a position\n- When placing entities next to transport belts, use appropriate spacing or different directions\n- Consider using alternative positions when standard placement fails due to occupied tiles\n\n### Power Connection Issues\n- Ensure all machines requiring electricity are connected to the power network\n- Connect separate power networks using electric poles with appropriate spacing\n\n### Production Line Issues\n- Verify all required ingredients are available before starting production\n- Ensure proper fuel supply for burner-type entities\n- Check that inserters have correct pickup and drop positions\n\n### Crafting Errors\n- Items like copper plates cannot be crafted directly - use appropriate production methods (furnaces)\n- Verify recipe requirements and use correct production facilities\n\n### Resource Management\n- Ensure mining drills are available in inventory before attempting to place them\n- Keep track of fuel requirements for burner-type entities"}
