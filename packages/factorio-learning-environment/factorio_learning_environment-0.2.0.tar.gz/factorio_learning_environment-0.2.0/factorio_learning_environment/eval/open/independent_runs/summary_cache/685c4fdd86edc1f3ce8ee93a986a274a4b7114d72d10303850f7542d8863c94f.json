No changes have been noted since the previous report.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Automation Setup\nConsists of a burner\u2011mining drill positioned at (\u201315.0, \u201350.0) complemented by a wooden chest and interconnected transport belts that efficiently collect and route iron\u2011ore. The setup remains unchanged.\n\n### Steam Power Generation System\nConsists of:\n\u2022 A boiler at (8.0, 20.5) that supplies steam.\n\u2022 A network of steam engines placed at (0.5, 9.5), (18.5, 11.5), (1.5, 13.5), (13.5, 14.5), (19.5, 14.5), (22.5, 18.5), (17.5, 20.5), (12.5, 21.5) and (4.5, 23.5).\n\u2022 An extra steam engine intended to integrate into the network that remains unplaceable due to severe congestion. Overlapping and misaligned burner\u2011inserters, transport belts and other interfering entities (especially near the boiler at (8.0, 20.5) and the obstructed buildable area around (8.5, 22.5)) continue to block its placement.\n\n### Automation Research Lab\nConsists of a laboratory configured to process automation science packs. The lab remains unpowered. Recent diagnostics now show an updated electrical identifier (electrical_id now at 7599) while still experiencing power connectivity issues.\n\n### Electrical and Transport Infrastructure\nConsists of interconnected electricity groups, belt groups, and pipe groups that distribute power and maintain material flow across the base. No structural modifications have been observed in this setup.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 Extra Steam Engine Placement Issue\n  - The extra steam engine repeatedly fails to be placed due to severe congestion in the designated area around the boiler at (8.0, 20.5) and an obstructed buildable space near (8.5, 22.5).\n  - Recommendation: Manually inspect the boiler\u2019s vicinity and its connection interfaces. Remove or reposition overlapping burner\u2011inserters, misaligned transport belts, and other interfering entities. Alternatively, consider relocating the extra steam engine to a dedicated area with sufficient clearance or reconfigure the boiler layout.\n\n\u2022 Burner\u2011Inserter Fuel and Source Item Issues\n  - Numerous burner\u2011inserters across both the mining and smelting systems display warnings such as \u201cout of fuel\u201d or \u201cwaiting for source items.\u201d\n  - Recommendation: Ensure that a reliable fuel supply and proper source item routing are in place. Adjust the positioning of chests and transport belts as necessary to maintain uninterrupted fueling and delivery.\n\n\u2022 Steam Engine Connectivity Warnings\n  - Multiple steam engines continue to report connectivity issues, including \u201cnot connected to power network\u201d and missing fluid inputs (\u201cno input liquid\u201d and \u201cno fluid present in connections\u201d).\n  - Recommendation: Verify the alignment and connection of pipes and power interfaces associated with the steam engine network. Correct any misalignments to establish effective power and fluid delivery.\n\n\u2022 Laboratory Power Deficiency\n  - The Automation Research Lab remains unpowered.\n  - Recommendation: Reassess the lab\u2019s electrical connections and ensure it is properly integrated into the active power grid to restore its functionality."}
