{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nThis facility is designed to mine iron ore and smelt it into iron plates. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0): This drill extracts iron ore from the ground. It is currently fueled with coal and has a warning indicating that its output is blocked by an item on the ground, suggesting there is no sink entity to accept the output.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0): This furnace is used to smelt the iron ore into iron plates. It is fueled with coal but currently has no ingredients to smelt, as indicated by its warning status.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities\n- **Transport Belt, Wooden Chest, and Burner Inserter Placement Errors**: Ensure that the desired location for placing these entities is not already occupied by another entity. Verify the placement area is clear before attempting to place these items.\n\n### Errors when Moving Entities\n- **Stone Furnace Movement Error**: Confirm that the target location for moving the stone furnace is valid and unoccupied. Ensure there is enough space for the entity to be placed at the new location.\n\n### Errors in Entity Retrieval\n- **Stone Furnace Retrieval Error**: When attempting to get an entity at a specific position, ensure that the entity type matches the expected type and that the entity exists at the specified coordinates.\n\n### Output Blockage Warnings\n- **Burner Mining Drill Output Blockage**: Address the warning by ensuring there is a sink entity, such as a chest or conveyor belt, to accept the output from the drill. Clear any items blocking the drop position to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Insufficient Ingredients for Smelting\n- **Stone Furnace No Ingredients Warning**: Ensure that the stone furnace has the necessary ingredients, such as iron ore, to perform smelting operations. Regularly supply the furnace with the required materials to prevent idle time."}
