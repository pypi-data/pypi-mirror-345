{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0) with coal as fuel, smelting iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter 1** at position (1.5, 0.5) transferring iron plates from the furnace to a wooden chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (2.5, 0.5) storing iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter 2** at position (3.5, 0.5) extracting iron plates from the wooden chest and placing them onto a transport belt.\n- **Transport Belt** connecting positions (3.5, 0.5) to (5.5, 0.5) and (4.5, 0.5) to (6.5, 0.5), moving iron plates towards the end chest.\n- **Burner Inserter 3** at position (6.5, 0.5) transferring iron plates from the transport belt to the end chest.\n- **End Wooden Chest** at position (7.5, 0.5) collecting iron plates from the transport belt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied positions\n- Ensure that the target position for placing an entity is not already occupied by another entity. Consider adjusting the spacing, changing the direction, or selecting a different reference position.\n\n### Errors when connecting belts directly from a chest\n- Use an inserter to extract items from a chest before attempting to connect them to a transport belt. Belts cannot be directly connected to chests.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient inventory items\n- Ensure you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to place or craft entities. For instance, gather wood before crafting a wooden chest.\n\n### Errors when attempting to craft without required resources\n- Verify that all required sub-ingredients are available in your inventory before crafting an item. For example, wood must be gathered as it is a raw resource needed for crafting wooden chests."}
