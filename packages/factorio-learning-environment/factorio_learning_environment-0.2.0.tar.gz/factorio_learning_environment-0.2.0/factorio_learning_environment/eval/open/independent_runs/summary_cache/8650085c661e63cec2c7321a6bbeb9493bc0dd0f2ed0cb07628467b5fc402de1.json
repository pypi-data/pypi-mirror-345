{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -80.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest (position 41.5, -80.5) containing coal (391 units).\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 41.0, -82.0) with coal (9 units) as fuel. It is currently working and has a warning indicating that the chest at drop position (41.5, -80.5) is full.\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position -15.0, -50.0) with coal (50 units) as fuel. It has warnings indicating no ingredients to smelt, furnace fuel source is full, and furnace result is full.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n- **Errors when extracting items from the wooden chest**\n  - Ensure that the quantity you are trying to extract does not exceed the available amount in the wooden chest. The extraction attempt for 50 units of coal failed multiple times due to insufficient quantity.\n\n- **Errors when picking up entities due to full inventory**\n  - Make sure to manage your inventory space before attempting to pick up entities. The pickup attempt for the wooden chest failed multiple times because the inventory was full.\n\n- **Errors when inserting items into the burner mining drill**\n  - Ensure that the burner mining drill has sufficient capacity to accept the inserted items. The drill has been successfully receiving coal, but keep an eye on its fuel levels.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions Defined:**\n  - `extract_item(Prototype.Coal, wooden_chest, quantity=50)`: Failed due to insufficient quantity in the wooden chest.\n  - `pickup_entity(Prototype.WoodenChest, Position(41.5, -80.5))`: Failed due to full inventory.\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `extracted_count`: int\n  - `quantity`: int\n  - `wooden_chest`: Entity\n  - `Position`: Class (with attributes x: float, y: float)\n  - `current_inventory`: dict"}
