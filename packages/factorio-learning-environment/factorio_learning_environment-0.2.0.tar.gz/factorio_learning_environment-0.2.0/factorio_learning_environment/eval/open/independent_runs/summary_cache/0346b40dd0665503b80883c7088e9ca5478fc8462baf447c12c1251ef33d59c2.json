The inserters at (40.5, -80.5), (6.5, -57.5), and (8.5, -57.5) are repeatedly blocked.\n\n### Not enough resources\n- Ensure that you have enough resources in your inventory before attempting to craft or build something. Specifically, the agent repeatedly attempts to craft something requiring iron ore and wooden chests, but does not have enough of either.\n\n### Inserter already has fuel\n- Check the inserter's inventory before inserting fuel to avoid wasting resources.\n\nNAMESPACE\nImportant variables:\n- inventory: Dict[str, int]\n```"}
