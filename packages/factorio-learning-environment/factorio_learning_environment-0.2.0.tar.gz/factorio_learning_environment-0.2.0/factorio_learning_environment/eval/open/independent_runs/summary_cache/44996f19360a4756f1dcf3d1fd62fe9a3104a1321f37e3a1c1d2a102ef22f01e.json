{"content": "# Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nThis facility is responsible for mining and smelting iron ore into iron plates. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0), which extracts iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-15.5, -48.5) and (-14.5, -48.5), used for temporary storage of resources.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5), responsible for transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0), which smelts iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-14.5, -47.5), which moves items between entities.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-10.0, -48.0), which is currently not in use due to lack of ingredients.\n\n### Storage Area\nConsists of multiple wooden chests used for storing iron plates:\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-6.5, -49.5), (-6.5, -48.5), (-7.5, -48.5), (-5.5, -48.5), (-4.5, -48.5), and (-3.5, -48.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extract_item function\n- Ensure the target entity has the required items before attempting extraction.\n- Verify the quantity specified for extraction is available in the entity.\n\n### Inserter Blockage Issues\n- Ensure the drop position for inserters is not blocked by other items or entities.\n- Regularly clear output areas to prevent inserters from stalling.\n\n### Furnace Ingredient Shortage\n- Ensure furnaces have a continuous supply of ingredients to prevent idle time.\n- Monitor and refill the furnace's ingredient inventory as needed."}
