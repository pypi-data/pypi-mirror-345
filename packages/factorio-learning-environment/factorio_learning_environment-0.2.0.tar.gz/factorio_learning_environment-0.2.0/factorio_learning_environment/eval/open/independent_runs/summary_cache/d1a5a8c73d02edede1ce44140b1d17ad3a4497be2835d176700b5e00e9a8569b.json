{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Stone Furnace Smelting Setup at position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of:\n\u2022 Stone Furnace at (41.0, -82.0) processing ores.\n\u2022 Burner Inserter at (41.5, -83.5) transferring furnace output.\n\u2022 Wooden Chest at (41.5, -84.5) storing processed items.\n\u2022 Wooden Chest at (42.5, -81.5) serving as additional storage.\n\n### Lab Setup at position (~45.5, -79.5)\nConsists of:\n\u2022 Lab (various electrical IDs over time; latest at 207) at its designated position receiving automation science packs for research.\n\n### Boiler and Steam Engine Production Setup\nConsists of:\n\u2022 Boiler originally at (42.5, -79.0) now repositioned to (-21.0, 26.5) near the Offshore Pump. The repositioned boiler has been picked up and placed with connection points now at (-20.5, 24.5) and (-20.5, 28.5), with its steam output at (-23.0, 26.5). It shows warnings such as \u201cno input liquid\u201d though it received wood fuel in a later step.\n\u2022 Steam Engine (Generator) at (48.5, -75.5) with its connection points at (48.5, -78.0) and (48.5, -73.0) continues to be disconnected from power and displays warnings (not receiving electricity, no input liquid, no fluid present in connections).\n\n### Offshore Pump Water Supply Setup\nConsists of:\n\u2022 Offshore Pump at (\u201317.5, 26.5) operating with a connection point at (\u201317.5, 25.5) and providing water.\n\u2022 Multiple PipeGroups linking the offshore pump to the boiler system. The latest pipe group of interest is at position (\u201316.5, 25.5) (FULL_OUTPUT) with others nearby designated by their fluid system IDs.\n\n### Electricity Pole Network\nConsists of:\n\u2022 Multiple Small Electric Poles (positions around the lab and generator) interconnected in an ElectricityGroup (latest ID 207) linking poles at positions such as (48.5, \u201379.5), (46.5, \u201375.5), and (48.5, \u201380.5).\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 Connection Failures for Water Supply \u2013 Several attempts to connect the Offshore Pump to the Boiler have failed due to missing required items. Verify inventory and ensure that the correct connecting item (pipe) is picked up before attempting the connection.\n\u2022 Incorrect Prototype Usage in Pickup \u2013 An error occurred when using a construction prototype (StoneFurnace) instead of a proper Position object. Ensure that all tool or method arguments correctly supply Position objects rather than prototypes.\n\u2022 Boiler Placement Obstructions \u2013 Multiple boiler placement errors arose due to collisions with existing entities or unsuitable terrain (e.g., water areas). Increase spacing or alter direction/reference positions to avoid collisions with entities such as offshore pumps or water blocks.\n\u2022 Repeated Connection Attempt Handling \u2013 Repeated reconnection errors suggest reviewing the inventory requirements and ensuring that connection items are refilled or available prior to attempting reconnection procedures.\n\n"}
