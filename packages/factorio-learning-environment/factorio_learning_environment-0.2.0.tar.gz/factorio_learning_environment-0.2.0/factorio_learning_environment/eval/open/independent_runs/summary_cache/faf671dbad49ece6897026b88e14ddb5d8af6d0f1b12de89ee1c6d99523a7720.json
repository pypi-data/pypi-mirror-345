{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line 1 (around x=-2, y=-74)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (x=-2.0, y=-76.0) mining iron ore\n- Stone furnace (x=-1.0, y=-74.0) smelting iron plates\n- Burner inserter (x=0.5, y=-74.5) moving items to chest\n- Iron chest (x=1.5, y=-74.5) storing iron plates\n- Additional iron chest (x=0.5, y=-72.5) storing iron plates\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line 2 (around x=3, y=-73)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace (x=3.0, y=-73.0)\n- Stone furnace (x=5.0, y=-73.0)\n- Burner inserter (x=2.5, y=-74.5) moving items from chest\n- Burner inserter (x=6.5, y=-72.5) moving items to storage\n- Iron chest (x=7.5, y=-72.5) storing iron plates\n- Iron chest (x=3.5, y=-71.5) for additional storage\n\n### Copper Plate Production Line (around x=-20, y=-74)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (x=-21.0, y=-73.0) mining copper ore\n- Iron chest (x=-21.5, y=-74.5) storing copper ore\n- Burner inserter (x=-20.5, y=-74.5) moving items\n- Stone furnace (x=-19.0, y=-74.0) smelting copper plates\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter placement and orientation errors\n- Ensure inserter drop position aligns with the target entity's input position\n- Check that inserter's orientation allows it to reach both source and destination entities\n- The inserter at x=2.5, y=-74.5 has incorrect drop position (x=3.5, y=-74.5) which is blocked\n\n### Resource management issues\n- Mining drill at x=-21.0, y=-73.0 is out of fuel, ensure regular fuel supply\n- Some mining drills have blocked outputs, ensure there are appropriate destination entities for the mined resources\n\n### Space management\n- Some entities have \"output blocked\" warnings due to items on ground\n- Ensure proper spacing between entities and clear paths for item movement\n- Make sure there are appropriate destination entities for all outputs\n\n### Entity status monitoring\n- Multiple furnaces show \"no ingredients to smelt\" warning\n- Ensure proper supply chain of materials to keep production flowing\n- Monitor fuel levels in burner entities to prevent work stoppage"}
