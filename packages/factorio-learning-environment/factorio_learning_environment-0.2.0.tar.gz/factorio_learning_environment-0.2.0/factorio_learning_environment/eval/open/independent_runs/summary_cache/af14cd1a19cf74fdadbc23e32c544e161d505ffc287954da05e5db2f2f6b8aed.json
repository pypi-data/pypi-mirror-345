{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator near position (x=3.0, y=12.0)\n\nThis structure is set up to generate electricity using steam power. The agent attempted to connect the boilers to the steam engines using pipes but encountered several placement and connection issues. The steam engines were picked up and re-placed further away from the boilers to allow space for pipes. Currently, the system is partially built, with water piped to the boilers, but the steam output is not yet connected to the engines.\n\n*   **Offshore Pump** at position (x=-9.5, y=-0.5): Extracts water. Connected via pipes to the boilers.\n*   **Boiler 1** at position (x=0.0, y=10.5): Heats water into steam (currently requires fuel). Steam output is at (x=1.5, y=10.5).\n*   **Boiler 2** at position (x=0.0, y=13.5): Heats water into steam (currently requires fuel). Steam output is at (x=1.5, y=13.5).\n*   **Steam Engine 1** at position (x=4.5, y=10.5): Intended to consume steam to generate power.\n*   **Steam Engine 2** at position (x=4.5, y=13.5): Intended to consume steam to generate power.\n*   **"}
