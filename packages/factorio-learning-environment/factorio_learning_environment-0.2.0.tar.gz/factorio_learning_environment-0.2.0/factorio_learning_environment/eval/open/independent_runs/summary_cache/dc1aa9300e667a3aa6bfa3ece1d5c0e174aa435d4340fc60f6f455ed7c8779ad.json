{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Smelting Setup at Position (-14.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) fueled with coal and processing iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-13.5, -46.5) storing iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -47.5) transferring iron plates from the furnace to the wooden chest.\n\n### Iron Smelting Setup at Position (-16.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-16.0, -49.0) fueled with coal and processing iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure that the target tile is unoccupied before attempting to place an entity. Placement errors occurred when trying to place a Transport Belt and Iron Chest at occupied positions.\n\n### Errors in crafting without the appropriate setup\n- Iron plates cannot be crafted manually; they require a Stone Furnace for smelting. Ensure you have the necessary structures before attempting to craft items that require specific machinery.\n\n### Errors during entity placement due to validation issues\n- Ensure that the dimensions and properties of entities are correctly defined and valid. Validation errors occurred during Stone Furnace placement, indicating issues with the expected input types.\n\n### Errors related to inventory management\n- Before inserting items into entities, confirm that the required items are available in your inventory. An error occurred when attempting to insert iron ore into a furnace without having any in the inventory."}
