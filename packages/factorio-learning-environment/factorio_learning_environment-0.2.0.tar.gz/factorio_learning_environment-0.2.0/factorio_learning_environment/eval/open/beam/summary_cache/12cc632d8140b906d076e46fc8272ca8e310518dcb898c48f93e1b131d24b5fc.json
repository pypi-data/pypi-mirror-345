{"content": "It looks like the `random` module wasn't imported, which is causing the `NameError`. Let's fix that by ensuring the `random` module is imported at the beginning of the script. Here's the corrected code:\n\n```python\nimport random\n\ndef ensure_entity_placement(prototype, position=None):\n    \"\"\"Ensure that a given entity is placed.
