{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0)\n  - Fueled with coal and actively mining iron ore.\n  - Drops mined ore into a chest at position (-14.5, -48.5).\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-14.5, -48.5) and (-15.5, -48.5)\n  - Used for storing mined iron ore.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0)\n  - Fueled with coal and used for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n  - Currently has a warning for \"no ingredients to smelt\".\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-14.5, -47.5)\n  - Transfers items between the chests.\n  - Fueled with coal and currently waiting for source items.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when extracting items from non-existent or empty entities\n- Ensure that the target entity exists and contains the items you wish to extract before attempting extraction.\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Before placing an entity, verify that the target tile is unoccupied by other entities. Consider adjusting the spacing, direction, or reference position to avoid collisions.\n\n### Errors when placing entities in unsuitable locations\n- Ensure that the target location for placing an entity is suitable and does not conflict with existing entities or terrain features like water. Adjust the placement parameters accordingly.\n\n### Errors due to full storage\n- Regularly check and manage the inventory of storage entities to prevent them from becoming full, which can halt production processes."}
