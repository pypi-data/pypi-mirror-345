All elements remain as previously established.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Automation Setup  \nPurpose: Facilitates the extraction of iron ore and its conveyance toward processing areas.  \nComponents: A burner\u2011mining drill with its adjacent wooden chest, several burner\u2011inserters lining the extraction site, and transport belts that channel the mined ore. This setup is unchanged from the historical report.\n\n### Steam Power Generation System  \nPurpose: Generates electrical power from steam energy.  \nComponents: A boiler located at Position(8.0, 20.5) with connection points at approximately (8.5, 18.5) and (8.5, 22.5), and multiple steam engines placed at various positions (e.g. (0.5, 9.5), (18.5, 11.5), (1.5, 13.5), (13.5, 14.5), (19.5, 14.5), (22.5, 18.5), (17.5, 20.5), (12.5, 21.5), (4.5, 23.5)). Notably, an extra steam engine remains in inventory due to unresolved spatial congestion issues around the boiler area.\n\n### Automation Research Lab  \nPurpose: Conducts technological research using science packs.  \nComponents: Laboratory units that process automation\u2011science\u2011packs; these labs intermittently experience issues with power connectivity but remain otherwise intact.\n\n### Offshore Pump and Fluid Network  \nPurpose: Secures a steady water supply for fluid processes.  \nComponents: An offshore pump positioned at (0.5, 30.5) linked to a network of pipe groups that distribute water across the map. The layout and connections are as previously reported.\n\n### Electricity, Transport, and Fluid Infrastructure  \nPurpose: Provides the foundational network for power distribution, material logistics, and fluid transport.  \nComponents: Electricity groups formed by arrays of power poles, belt groups that interconnect production sites, and pipe groups that maintain dedicated fluid systems. These interconnected networks have not seen any structural changes.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 Extra Steam Engine Placement Issue  \n  \u2013 The extra steam engine remains unplaceable due to persistent spatial congestion. Overlapping burner\u2011inserters and misaligned transport belts in the boiler zone (notably near Position(8.0, 20.5) and around (8.5, 22.5)) prevent the formation of a clear build area.  \n  \u2013 Mitigation Strategies:  \n     \u2022 Remove or reposition conflicting entities (such as burner\u2011inserters and transport belts) in and around the boiler zone to clear sufficient build space.  \n     \u2022 Adjust the design of adjoining connection interfaces to ensure that expansion space is available for additional power generation units.  \n     \u2022 Consider relocating the extra steam engine to a less congested area or redesigning the boiler layout to resolve the placement bottleneck."}
