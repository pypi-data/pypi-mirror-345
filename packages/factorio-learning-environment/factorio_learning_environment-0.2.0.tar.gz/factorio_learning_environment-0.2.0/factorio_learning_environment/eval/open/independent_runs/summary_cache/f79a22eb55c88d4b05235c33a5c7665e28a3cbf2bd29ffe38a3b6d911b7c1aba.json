{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0), extracting iron ore and dropping it into a chest.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-14.5, -48.5) and (-15.5, -48.5), used for storing extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5), transferring iron ore from the chest to the stone furnaces.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (-12.0, -48.0) and (-10.0, -48.0), smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-6.5, -49.5), (-6.5, -48.5), (-7.5, -48.5), and (-5.5, -48.5), used for storing iron plates.\n\n### Iron Ore Buffer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -46.5), used for buffering iron ore before it is smelted.\n\n### Iron Plate Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-8.5, -47.5), transferring iron plates from the stone furnaces to storage chests.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-7.5, -47.5), used as an intermediary storage for iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entity (e.g., chest or furnace) has items available for the inserter to pick up. Regularly check and replenish the source inventory to avoid idle inserters.\n\n### Furnace Result is Full\n- Regularly extract smelted items from the furnace output to prevent it from becoming full and halting production. Consider using inserters to automate this process.\n\n### No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Ensure that furnaces are continuously supplied with raw materials (e.g., iron ore) to prevent them from idling. Automate the supply chain with inserters and belts if necessary.\n\n### Furnace Belt at Drop Position is Blocked\n- Ensure that the drop position of inserters is clear and that there is enough space in the destination entity to receive items. Regularly clear or expand storage to prevent blockages."}
