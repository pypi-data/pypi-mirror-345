{"content": "\"\"\"\nThe attempt to rebuild the active furnace has resulted in a new setup, but the furnace is currently not operational:\n\n### New Active Furnace Output Status:\n- The newly built active furnace is empty and shows no contents.\n- The status indicates **\"NO_FUEL\"** and **\"NO_INGREDIENTS\"**, meaning it is not engaged in any processing and lacks the necessary materials to operate.\n\n### Overall Inventory Overview:\n- **Current Inventory**:\n  - 5 pieces of stone furnaces (including the newly built one)\n  - **14 pieces of coal** available (increased due to previous operations).\n  - **1 piece of stone** available.\n  - **5 pieces of iron ore** available.\n  - **21 pieces of iron plates** available.\n\n### Observations:\n- The new furnace is not recognizing any fuel or ingredients, which suggests that it may require a fresh input of materials to initiate operations.\n- The increase in coal indicates that there is enough fuel available, but the furnace needs to be properly loaded with ingredients to start smelting.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Load Coal into the Furnace**: I will insert some coal into the new furnace to provide it with fuel.\n2. **Load Stone and Copper Ore**: After fueling the furnace, I will attempt to load the **1 piece of stone** and **1 piece of Copper Ore** to see if it engages in smelting.\n3. **Monitor Furnace Behavior**: After loading the materials, I will check if the furnace transitions to a working state.\n\nLet\u2019s proceed by inserting coal into the new active furnace. \n\"\"\"\n\n# Load coal into the new active furnace to provide fuel\ninsert_item(Prototype.Coal, new_active_furnace, quantity=7)  # Insert 7 pieces of coal into the new active furnace\n\n# Check the inventory status of the new furnace after loading coal\nnew_active_furnace_status_after_coal = inspect_inventory(new_active_furnace)  # Inspect the status of the furnace post-insertion\noverall_inventory_after_coal_loading = inspect_inventory()  # Check total inventory after inserting coal.\n\nprint(f\"New Active Furnace inventory status after loading coal: {new_active_furnace_status_after_coal}\")  # Status of the furnace after loading coal.\nprint(f\"Overall current inventory after loading coal: {overall_inventory_after_coal_loading}\")  # Total inventory post operations.\nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")  # Review entities available on the map.", "summary_range": "[1-364]"}
