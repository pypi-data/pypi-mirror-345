{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Setup at position (-28.0, -61.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at (-28.0, -61.0) for mining iron ore and copper ore.\n- **Stone Furnace** at (-26.0, -61.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at (-27.5, -62.5) for transferring items between the mining drill and furnace.\n- **Wooden Chest** at (-28.5, -62.5) for storing coal used as fuel.\n- **Wooden Chest** at (-27.5, -59.5) for storing mined iron ore and copper ore.\n\n#### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Setup at position (2.0, -63.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at (2.0, -63.0) for mining iron ore.\n- **Stone Furnace** at (4.0, -63.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at (3.5, -61.5) for transferring items between the mining drill and furnace.\n- **Wooden Chest** at (2.5, -61.5) for storing items.\n- **Wooden Chest** at (4.5, -61.5) for storing iron ore.\n\n#### Additional Wooden Chests for Storage\n- **Wooden Chest** at (-29.5, -59.5) for overflow storage of iron ore and copper ore.\n- **Wooden Chest** at (-25.5, -59.5) for additional storage.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when extracting items\n- Ensure the target entity (e.g., chest or mining drill) contains the item you are trying to extract before attempting extraction.\n- Verify that the entity is accessible and not blocked or full.\n\n#### Errors when inserting items\n- Ensure the target entity (e.g., mining drill or furnace) has space for the item you are trying to insert.\n- Verify that the item exists in your inventory before attempting insertion.\n\n#### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure you have the required item (e.g., wooden chest) in your inventory before attempting to place it.\n- Verify that the target tile is empty and not occupied by another entity.\n\n#### Errors related to fuel and resources\n- Ensure mining drills and furnaces have sufficient fuel (e.g., coal) to operate.\n- Check that furnaces have the necessary ingredients (e.g., iron ore) for smelting.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n#### Utility Functions\n- **extract_item(Prototype, entity, quantity)**: Extracts items from an entity. Fails if the entity does not contain the item or is inaccessible.\n- **insert_item(Prototype, entity, quantity)**: Inserts items into an entity. Fails if the entity is full or the item is not in inventory.\n- **place_entity(Prototype, position)**: Places an entity at a specified position. Fails if the item is not in inventory or the tile is occupied.\n\n#### Important Variables\n- **chest**: Position (-27.5, -59.5), type: WoodenChest.\n- **new_chest_pos**: Position (-29.5, -59.5), type: Position.\n- **mining_drill**: Position (-28.0, -61.0), type: BurnerMiningDrill."}
