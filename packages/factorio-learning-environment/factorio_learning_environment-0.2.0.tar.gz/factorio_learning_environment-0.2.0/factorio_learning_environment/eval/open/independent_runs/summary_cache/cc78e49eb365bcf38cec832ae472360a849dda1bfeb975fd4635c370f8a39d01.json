{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-15.0, -76.0) and a Wooden Chest at Position (-15.5, -77.5) for storing mined iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-19.0, -73.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Stone Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0) with iron plates as output.\n- Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0) with iron plates as output.\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) not receiving electricity, connected to a Wooden Chest at Position (6.5, -59.5) storing iron ore and iron plates.\n\n### Pipe Network\nConsists of multiple PipeGroups:\n- PipeGroup at Position (-35.5, -122.5)\n- PipeGroup at Position (-48.5, -112.5)\n- PipeGroup at Position (-37.5, -111.5)\n- PipeGroup at Position (-42.5, -109.5)\n- PipeGroup at Position (-0.5, 10.5)\n- PipeGroup at Position (-0.5, 17.5)\n- PipeGroup at Position (-12.5, 23.5)\n- PipeGroup at Position (-5.5, 24.5)\n- PipeGroup at Position (1.5, 24.5)\n- PipeGroup at Position (2.5, 25.5)\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of:\n- ElectricityGroup with poles spanning from Position (1.5, -68.5) to Position (-7.5, -74.5).\n\n### Laboratory\n- Lab with input of automation science packs, currently without power.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Using Entity Attributes\n- Ensure that when interacting with entities, you are using valid attributes. For example, the 'PipeGroup' object does not have a 'prototype' attribute, which caused an AttributeError. Verify the available attributes of an entity before attempting operations on them.\n\n### Errors when Entities are Not Receiving Power\n- Ensure that all entities requiring power, such as inserters and labs, are connected to a functioning power source. Check the connections and the status of the electricity network to resolve power issues."}
