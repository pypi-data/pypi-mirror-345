repeated placement errors (e.g. electric pole placement adjacent to an occupied transport belt at (x=4.5, y=19.5)) require adjusting spacing or direction.\n\u2003\u2013 Confirm the buildable area of a structure before moving, as error messages about occupied tiles indicate potential conflicts with nearby entities.\n\n\u2022 Pipe Connection and Resource Management:\n\u2003\u2013 Check and secure sufficient pipe resources prior to connecting fluid systems; an error stating \u201cnot enough pipe\u201d (required 9, available 0) demonstrates the need for proactive resource management.\n\u2003\u2013 Validate that function arguments refer to valid entities (avoid passing None) when interacting with fuel insertion routines.\n\n\u2022 Power Network and Operational Readiness:\n\u2003\u2013 Ensure that critical processing units (e.g. the Assembling Machine in the Copper Cable Factory) are both connected to the power network and supplied with necessary resources to avoid operational warnings.\n\u2003\u2013 Monitor fuel and input levels for boilers, steam engines, and related components to prevent interruptions in fluid and power supply.\n\n\u2022 General Checks:\n\u2003\u2013 Before executing build or connection operations, review both spatial constraints and resource inventories to reduce repetitive errors involving placement, crafting dependencies, and connectivity between modules.\n"}
