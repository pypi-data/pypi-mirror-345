{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates. Fuel: coal.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (1.5, 0.5) transferring iron plates from the furnace to a wooden chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (2.5, 0.5) storing iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (3.5, 0.5) extracting iron plates from the wooden chest and placing them onto a transport belt.\n- **Transport Belt** (BeltGroup) connecting the burner inserter at position (3.5, 0.5) to another burner inserter at position (6.5, 0.5).\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (6.5, 0.5) transferring iron plates from the transport belt to a wooden chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (7.5, 0.5) collecting iron plates from the transport belt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied positions\n- Ensure there is enough space and no existing entities at the target position before placing a new entity. Consider increasing spacing or changing the direction or reference position.\n\n### Errors when connecting belts directly from a chest\n- Use an inserter to extract items from a chest before connecting them to a transport belt. Belts cannot be directly connected to a chest.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient inventory items\n- Check your inventory to ensure you have the required items before attempting to place or craft entities. Gather necessary raw resources if needed.\n\n### Errors when crafting items due to missing raw resources\n- Ensure you have all the required raw resources in your inventory before attempting to craft items. For items like wooden chests, gather wood first as it is a raw resource not available through crafting recipes."}
