{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Coal Mine at position (41.0, -86.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (41.0, -86.0) connected to a transport belt at position (41.5, -84.5)\n- Burner mining drill at position (43.0, -86.0) connected to a wooden chest at position (43.5, -84.5)\n- Wooden chest at position (43.5, -84.5) with coal inventory\n- Wooden chest at position (41.5, -82.5) with coal inventory\n- Wooden chest at position (41.5, -79.5) with empty inventory\n- Stone furnace at position (43.0, -79.0) with iron plate inventory\n- Wooden chest at position (43.5, -76.5) with empty inventory\n\n#### Iron Ore Mine at position (-17.0, -52.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (-17.0, -52.0) connected to a wooden chest at position (-16.5, -50.5)\n- Wooden chest at position (-16.5, -50.5) with iron ore inventory\n- Stone furnace at position (-15.0, -51.0) with iron plate inventory\n- Stone furnace at position (-13.0, -50.0) with iron plate inventory\n- Wooden chest at position (-13.5, -51.5) with empty inventory\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Blocked Inserters\n- Clear blocked inserters to ensure smooth operation of the mining and smelting processes. Blocked inserters can halt production and cause inefficiencies.\n\n#### Full Chests\n- Regularly empty chests at drop positions to prevent mining drills from stopping due to full chests. This ensures continuous resource extraction.\n\n#### No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Ensure furnaces have a steady supply of raw materials (coal and iron ore) to avoid warnings and maintain continuous smelting operations.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n#### Utility Functions\n- **clear_blocked_inserter(position: Position)**: Clears a blocked inserter at the specified position.\n  - Success: Inserter is unblocked and resumes operation.\n  - Failure: Inserter remains blocked if the position is incorrect or the inserter is not blocked.\n\n- **refuel_entity(entity: Entity, fuel: str, amount: int)**: Refuels an entity with the specified fuel and amount.\n  - Success: Entity is refueled and resumes operation.\n  - Failure: Entity is not refueled if the fuel type or amount is incorrect.\n\n#### Important Variables\n- **coal_inventory**: Inventory of coal in various chests and furnaces.\n- **iron_ore_inventory**: Inventory of iron ore in chests and furnaces.\n- **iron_plate_inventory**: Inventory of iron plates in furnaces and chests."}
