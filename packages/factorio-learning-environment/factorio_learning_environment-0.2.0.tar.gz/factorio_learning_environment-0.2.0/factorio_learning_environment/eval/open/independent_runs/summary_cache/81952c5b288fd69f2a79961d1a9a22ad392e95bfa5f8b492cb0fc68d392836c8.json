In recent operations, 10 units of iron ore and 10 units of coal were inserted into this furnace, yielding 30 iron plates, demonstrating its role as the dedicated iron-processing structure.\n\n### Copper Smelting Furnace at Position(x=-27.0, y=-60.0)\nConsists solely of a furnace used to convert copper ore and coal into copper plates. This structure processed 50 units of copper ore along with 10 units of coal to produce 45 copper plates, serving as the copper-processing node.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 API Usage for Entity Retrieval:\n  \u2013 When calling get_entities, ensure the function\u2019s signature is strictly followed. Avoid using unsupported keyword arguments (such as \u201cradius\u201d) or supplying extra positional arguments that conflict with its definition.\n\n\u2022 Iteration over Potentially Null Results:\n  \u2013 Before iterating over the result of entity retrieval functions, verify that the returned value is a valid list. Fallback to an empty list if the function returns None to prevent TypeError.\n\n\u2022 Lab Placement and Crafting:\n  \u2013 Verify that the lab item is available in the inventory prior to placement; failure to do so leads to placement errors.\n  \u2013 Ensure that all required sub-ingredients (for example, iron-gear-wheels, electronic circuits, copper-cables, and copper-plates) are sufficiently available before attempting to craft a Lab.\n  \u2013 Confirm that the target placement tile is valid and unoccupied to avoid placement failures.\n\n"}
