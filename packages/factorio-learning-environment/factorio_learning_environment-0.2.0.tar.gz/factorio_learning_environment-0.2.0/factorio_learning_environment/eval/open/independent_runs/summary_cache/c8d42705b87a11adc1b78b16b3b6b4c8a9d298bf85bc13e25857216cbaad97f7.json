{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnaces**:\n  - Furnace at position (-15.0, -48.0) with fuel coal and producing iron plates.\n  - Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0) with fuel coal and producing iron plates.\n  - Furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0) with fuel coal and producing iron plates.\n\n### Iron Ore Extraction Site\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill**:\n  - Positioned at (4.0, -60.0), extracting iron ore and dropping it into a chest at position (4.5, -58.5).\n- **Chests**:\n  - Multiple wooden chests positioned around the mining drill, including:\n    - Chest at position (4.5, -58.5) storing extracted iron ore.\n    - Additional chests at positions (5.5, -60.5), (7.5, -60.5), (6.5, -60.5), (9.5, -60.5), and (8.5, -60.5) for storage purposes.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage Area\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Chests**:\n  - Wooden chests at positions (-14.5, -50.5), (-13.5, -50.5), (-12.5, -50.5), (-11.5, -50.5), (-10.5, -50.5), (-9.5, -50.5), (-8.5, -50.5), (-7.5, -50.5), (-6.5, -50.5), and (-5.5, -50.5) storing iron plates.\n  - Some chests are full, indicating a need for better inventory management.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Full Inventory\n- Ensure that chests are regularly emptied to prevent production halts. Full chests at positions (-11.5, -50.5), (-10.5, -50.5), (-9.5, -50.5), and (-8.5, -50.5) indicate that the iron plate storage is at capacity.\n\n### Errors with Extracting Resources\n- The burner mining drill at position (4.0, -60.0) has a warning about the chest at drop position being full. Regularly empty the chest at (4.5, -58.5) to continue efficient mining operations.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions were defined or invoked in the provided logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `iron_ore_inventory: int` - Represents the amount of iron ore in the player's inventory.\n- `iron_plate_inventory: int` - Represents the amount of iron plates in the player's inventory.\n- `coal_inventory: int` - Represents the amount of coal in the player's inventory.\n\nNo new utility functions or variable assignments were noted in the provided steps."}
