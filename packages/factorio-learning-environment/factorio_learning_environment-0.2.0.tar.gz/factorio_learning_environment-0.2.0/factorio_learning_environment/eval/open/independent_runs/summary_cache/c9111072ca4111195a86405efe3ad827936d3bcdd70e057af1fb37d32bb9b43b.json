If the furnace result is full, it cannot accept more items.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Repeated errors with furnace ingredient availability\n- Check that you have the necessary ingredients available before attempting to insert them into the furnace. If the furnace has no ingredients to smelt, it will not operate."}
