Always add an intermediary inserter for inputting items into the steam engine. This mistake recurred in multiple steps (210, 211, 213, 214, 215, 216, and 217).\n\n\u2022 Entity Placement Errors  \n\u2013 Before placing an entity, move close enough to the target position to avoid \u201ctarget position is too far\u201d errors.  \n\u2013 Confirm that the required item exists in the inventory (for example, a wooden chest) to prevent placement failures.\n\n\u2022 Variable Reference Errors  \n\u2013 Verify that all variables (such as the intended target reference like \u201ctarget_chest\u201d) are correctly defined and referenced to avoid NameErrors."}
