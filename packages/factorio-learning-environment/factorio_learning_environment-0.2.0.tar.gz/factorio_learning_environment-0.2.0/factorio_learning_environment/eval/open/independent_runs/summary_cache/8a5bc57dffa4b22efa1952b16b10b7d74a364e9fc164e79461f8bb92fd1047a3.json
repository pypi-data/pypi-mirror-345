{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report - Steps 0-31\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generation at Position(x=-9.5, y=-0.5) to (x=0.5, y=6.5)\nThis structure generates electricity using steam power. Coal is manually added to the boiler via a chest and inserter.\n*   **Offshore Pump** at Position(x=-9.5, y=-0.5): Extracts water. Status: `WORKING`.\n*   **Pipe Group** from Position(x=-8.5, y=-0.5) to Position(x=-4.5, y=0.5): Transports water to the boiler. Status: `WORKING`.\n*   **Boiler** at Position(x=-5.0, y=2.5): Heats water into steam using coal. Status: `WORKING` (Fuel: 13 coal).\n*   **Chest** at Position(x=-7.5, y=3.5): Stores coal for the boiler inserter. Inventory: 97 coal.\n*   **Burner Inserter** at Position(x=-7.5, y=2.5): Moves coal from the chest to the boiler. Status: `WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION` (pickup: x=-7.5, y=3.5, drop: x=-7.5, y=1.5 - Note: Drop position seems incorrect for boiler input).\n*   **Pipe Group** from Position(x=-6.5, y=2.5) to Position(x=-2.5, y=6.5): Transports steam to the engine. Status: `WORKING`.\n*   **Steam Engine** at Position(x=0.5, y=6.5): Consumes steam to generate electricity. Status: `WORKING`.\n*   **Electricity Poles** (various positions): Distribute power. Connected to the grid (ID: 146348).\n\n### Coal Mine at Position(x=17.5, y=1.5)\nThis structure mines coal and places it into a chest.\n*   **Electric Mining Drill** at Position(x=17.5, y=1.5): Mines coal. Status: `WORKING`. Drops coal at Position(x=17.5, y=3.5).\n*   **Chest** at Position(x=17.5, y=3.5"}
