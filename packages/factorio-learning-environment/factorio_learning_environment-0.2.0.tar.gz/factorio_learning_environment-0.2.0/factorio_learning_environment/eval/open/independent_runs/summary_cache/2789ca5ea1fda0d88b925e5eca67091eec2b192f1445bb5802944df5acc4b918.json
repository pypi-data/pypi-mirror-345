{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-20.0, -70.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace (position x=-20.0, y=-70.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates. Currently has warnings for no ingredients to smelt and a full fuel source.\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace (position x=0.0, y=0.0) for smelting copper ore into copper plates. Currently has a warning for a full fuel source.\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position x=53.0, y=-83.0) extracting coal.\n- Wooden Chests (positions x=52.5, y=-84.5 and x=54.5, y=-84.5) for storing coal.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Facility at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position x=-14.0, y=-53.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden Chests (positions x=-14.5, y=-54.5 and x=-12.5, y=-54.5) for storing iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter (position x=-13.5, y=-54.5) with a warning for blocked output.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining Facility at Position (-23.0, -68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position x=-23.0, y=-68.0) extracting copper ore.\n- Wooden Chest (position x=-23.5, y=-69.5) for storing copper ore.\n\n### Iron Ore Transfer System at Position (-19.5, -61.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Inserter (position x=-19.5, y=-61.5) transferring iron ore between chests.\n- Wooden Chests (positions x=-20.5, y=-61.5 and x=-18.5, y=-61.5) for storing iron ore.\n\n### Copper Ore Storage Facility at Various Positions\nConsists of multiple Wooden Chests at positions such as x=0.5, y=-4.5, x=5.5, y=-4.5, x=0.5, y=-2.5, etc., for storing copper ore.\n\n### Belt System\nConsists of BeltGroups connecting various positions, facilitating the movement of items across the map.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Furnaces\n- Ensure furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt to avoid warnings about no ingredients.\n- Regularly check and manage the fuel source to prevent it from becoming full and halting production.\n\n### Errors with Inserters\n- Ensure there is space in the destination for inserters to place items to avoid blocked outputs.\n- Verify that inserters have access to source items to operate efficiently.\n\n### General Placement Errors\n- Ensure that entities are placed in appropriate positions with clear paths for item flow to prevent operational blockages."}
