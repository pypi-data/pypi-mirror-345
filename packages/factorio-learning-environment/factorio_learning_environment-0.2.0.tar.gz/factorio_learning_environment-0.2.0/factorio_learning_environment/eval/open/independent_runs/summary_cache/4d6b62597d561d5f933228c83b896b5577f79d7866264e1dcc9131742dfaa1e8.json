{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Coal Mining and Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) with a coal supply of 12 units, actively working.\n- Wooden Chest at position (40.5, -83.5) containing 652 units of coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (42.5, -83.5) containing 735 units of coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (41.5, -83.5) that transfers coal between chests and the mining drill.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (61.0, -54.0) with 5 units of coal, currently not smelting due to lack of ingredients.\n- Stone Furnace at position (64.0, -53.0) with 13 units of coal, also not smelting due to lack of ingredients.\n- Wooden Chest at position (61.5, -52.5) containing 5 units of coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (62.5, -53.5) containing 5 units of coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (62.5, -52.5) containing 5 units of coal.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors due to Lack of Smelting Ingredients\n- Ensure that the stone furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Check the inventory of the furnaces and supply them with the required raw materials to prevent idle time.\n\n### Errors in Coal Management\n- Regularly check the coal supply in the mining drill and furnaces to ensure continuous operation. Automate coal transfer to avoid manual replenishment.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided steps.\n- Important variables:\n  - `coal_supply`: int, representing the amount of coal available in various chests and entities.\n  - `iron_plate_inventory`: int, representing the amount of iron plates produced and stored in furnaces."}
