Check the positions of the entities to ensure they align properly.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity on a tile before attempting to place it. Check for existing entities in the target tile.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items."}
