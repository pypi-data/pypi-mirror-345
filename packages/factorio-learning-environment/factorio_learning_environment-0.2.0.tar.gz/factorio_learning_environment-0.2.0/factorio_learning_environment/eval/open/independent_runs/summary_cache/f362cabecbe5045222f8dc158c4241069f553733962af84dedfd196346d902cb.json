{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo complete structure has been successfully placed on the map during these steps. Although recovery updates focused on supplying a Lab at (0.5, 2.5) and on operating furnaces for resource smelting, no Lab\u2014or any connected production structure\u2014was ultimately established.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 API Argument Misuse for Entity Retrieval\n  - When calling get_entities, avoid using unexpected keyword arguments (e.g. \u201cradius\u201d) or incorrect positional parameters. Verify the API signature and supply only the supported arguments. \n\n\u2022 Lab Placement Failures\n  - Confirm that the Lab item is present in the inventory before attempting placement at (0.5, 2.5) to prevent placement errors.\n\n\u2022 Iteration on a None Value\n  - Ensure that functions retrieving entities return an iterable (such as an empty list) rather than None to avoid errors when filtering (e.g. for labs).\n\n\u2022 Insufficient Resources for Lab Crafting\n  - Multiple lab crafting attempts failed due to a shortage of necessary sub-ingredients (for example, lacking enough iron-gear-wheels, copper-cables, or electronic-circuits). Double-check that the complete resource chain\u2014from raw materials to intermediary components\u2014is adequately supplied before initiating lab crafting.\n\n\u2022 Persistent Ingredient Deficits\n  - Even after recovery updates (including additional smelting and copper cable production), missing ingredients (such as extra iron-gear-wheels) continued to block lab crafting. Review resource conversion steps and inventory management to ensure all required components are produced in sufficient quantities."}
