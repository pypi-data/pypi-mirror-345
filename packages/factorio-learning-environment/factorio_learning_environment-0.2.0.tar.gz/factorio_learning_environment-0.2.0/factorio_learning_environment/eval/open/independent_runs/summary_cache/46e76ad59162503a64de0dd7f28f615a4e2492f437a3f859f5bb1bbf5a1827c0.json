The maximum distance allowed is 10 units.\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied or unplaceable terrain\n- Check if the target location is occupied by another entity or is part of unplaceable terrain (like water) before attempting to place an entity.\n- Ensure the area is clear and suitable for the entity you are trying to place.\n\n### Errors when placing entities next to another entity with specific direction\n- Verify that the direction and spacing used for placing an entity next to another are correct and do not result in collisions with existing entities.\n- Consider adjusting the spacing, direction, or reference position if placement fails due to potential collisions.\n\n### Errors when inspecting inventory of non-existent or inaccessible entities\n- Ensure the entity exists and is accessible before attempting to inspect its inventory.\n\n### Errors when getting entities that do not exist at a specified position\n- Verify that an entity of the expected type exists at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it.\n\n### Errors when finding nearest entities of a specific type\n- Be aware that there might not be any entities of the specified type on the surface, and handle this case accordingly.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Important Variables\n- `storage_tank_position`: Position(x=21.5, y=41.5) (type: Position)\n- `offshore_pump_buildable_area`: An area defined by left_top=Position(x=30.5, y=49.0), right_bottom=Position(x=32.5, y=50.0) (type: Area)\n- `boiler.position`: Position(x=29.5, y=48.0) (type: Position)\n\nNo utility functions have been defined by the agent in the given logs.
