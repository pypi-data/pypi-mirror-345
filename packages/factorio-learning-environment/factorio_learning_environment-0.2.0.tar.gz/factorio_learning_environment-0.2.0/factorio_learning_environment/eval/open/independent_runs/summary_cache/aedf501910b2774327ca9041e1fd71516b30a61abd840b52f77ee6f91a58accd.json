{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5) for coal storage.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-25.0, -64.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-25.0, -64.0) connected to a Stone Furnace at position (-23.0, -66.0) via Transport Belts.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-24.5, -66.5) storing iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-20.5, -65.5) transferring items between a Wooden Chest at position (-21.5, -65.5) and a Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -65.0).\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage Facility at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -54.5) for iron ore storage.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with a Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5) for storage.\n- Burner Inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) transferring items to the Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5).\n\n### Belt Networks\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (-25.5, -65.5) to (-23.5, -65.5) for material transport.\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (-24.5, -64.5) to (-22.5, -64.5) for material transport.\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (-14.5, -54.5) to (-14.5, -56.5) and further to (-17.5, -59.5) for material transport.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using transport belts\n- Ensure that all entities involved in belt connections are correctly instantiated and have valid attributes before attempting to connect them.\n\n### Furnace Capacity and Input Issues\n- Regularly check furnace input slots to ensure they are not full and can accept more resources. Consider setting up automated systems to manage input and output to prevent blockage.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placement to avoid conflicts with existing entities."}
