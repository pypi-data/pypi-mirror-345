{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-9.5, 24.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5) - Status: WORKING\n- Boiler at position (-2.5, 24.0) - Status: NO_FUEL/WORKING (varies)\n- Steam Engine at position (-5.5, 19.5) - Status: NOT_CONNECTED/WORKING (varies)\n- Pipe Group connecting Offshore Pump and Boiler, and Boiler and Steam Engine, with positions at (-4.5, 16.5) and (-9.5, 23.5) - Status: EMPTY/FULL_OUTPUT/WORKING (varies)\n- Electricity Group at position (-6.625, 20.375) - Status: NOT_PLUGGED_IN_ELECTRIC_NETWORK\n\n### Stone Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) - Status: NO_INGREDIENTS\n\n### Small Electric Poles\n- Small Electric Pole placed at position (-7.5, 18.5)\n- Small Electric Pole placed at position (-7.5, 17.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inventory Management\n- Ensure that the required items are available in the inventory before attempting to insert them into entities. For example, ensure coal is available before inserting it into the boiler.\n\n### Errors in Connecting Entities with Pipes\n- Verify that there are enough pipes in the inventory to connect entities. Craft or gather more pipes if necessary.\n- Ensure that the connection path between entities is valid and unobstructed when attempting to connect with pipes.\n\n### Errors with Electric Network Connection\n- Ensure that all components of the electricity network are properly connected and plugged into the electric network to avoid the NOT_PLUGGED_IN_ELECTRIC_NETWORK status.\n\n### Errors with Entity Placement\n- Ensure that the necessary items are available in the inventory before attempting to place entities such as small electric poles.\n\n### Index Errors\n- When accessing elements from a list or collection, ensure that the index is within the valid range to avoid IndexError."}
