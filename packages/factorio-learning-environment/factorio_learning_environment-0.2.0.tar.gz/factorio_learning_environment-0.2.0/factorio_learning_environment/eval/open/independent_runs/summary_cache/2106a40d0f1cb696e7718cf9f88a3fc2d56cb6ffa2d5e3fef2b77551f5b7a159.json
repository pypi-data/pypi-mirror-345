{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) extracting iron ore.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-14.0, -48.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-14.5, -46.5) transferring iron ore from the mining drill to the furnace.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-12.5, -47.5) transferring iron plates from the furnace to a storage chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-11.5, -47.5) storing iron plates.\n\n### Additional Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entity:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0) currently inactive due to lack of ingredients.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities on Occupied Tiles\n- Ensure that the target tile is unoccupied before placing a new entity. Consider adjusting the spacing, direction, or reference position to avoid conflicts with existing entities.\n\n### Misalignment Errors with Inserters\n- Verify that the pickup and drop positions of inserters align correctly with the source and destination entities. Adjust the inserter's position or the entities it interacts with to ensure proper alignment.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entity has available items for the inserter to pick up. Check the inventory of the source entity and refuel or restock as necessary.\n\n### Output Blocked by Items on the Ground\n- Clear any items blocking the output of entities like mining drills to ensure continuous operation. Ensure there is a sink entity in place to accept the output."}
