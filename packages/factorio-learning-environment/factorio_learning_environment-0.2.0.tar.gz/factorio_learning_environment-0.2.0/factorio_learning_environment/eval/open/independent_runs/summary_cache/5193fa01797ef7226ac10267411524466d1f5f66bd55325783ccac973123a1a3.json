Always attach an inserter that feeds items into the steam engine and use that inserter as the connection target.\n\n\u2022 Entity Placement Range Error  \n  Placement failures (e.g. \u201ctarget position \u2026 too far\u201d with a reported distance of 15.89 versus a 10\u2010unit maximum) require moving the player closer to the target position before attempting placement.\n\n\u2022 Undefined Reference Error  \n  A NameError (e.g. reference to \u201ctarget_chest\u201d not defined) occurred due to using an incorrect or undefined variable name. Ensure that the variable for the target entity is correctly defined and referenced.\n\n\u2022 Inventory Shortage Error  \n  Errors reporting missing items (such as \u201cNo wooden_chest in inventory\u201d) highlight that required items must be present in inventory prior to placement. Verify inventory availability before executing placement commands."}
