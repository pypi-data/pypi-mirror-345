{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Smelting Area (Position x=0.0-2.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of two stone furnaces that process iron ore into iron plates\n- Furnace 1 at position(0.0, 0.0)\n- Furnace 2 at position(2.0, 0.0)\n\n### Copper Smelting Area (Position x=4.0, y=4.0)\nSingle stone furnace processing copper ore into copper plates\n- Furnace at position(4.0, 4.0)\n\n### Electronic Circuit Production Line (Position x=6.5-12.5, y=11.5)\nAssembly line for creating electronic circuits consisting of:\n- Input wooden chest at position(6.5, 11.5)\n- Burner inserter at position(7.5, 11.5)\n- Assembling machine at position(9.5, 11.5)\n- Output burner inserter at position(11.5, 11.5)\n- Output wooden chest at position(12.5, 11.5)\n\n### Power Generation System (Position x=-9.5 to -2.5, y=22.5-28.5)\nComplete power generation setup with:\n- Offshore pump at position(-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe network connecting components\n- Boiler at position(-7.0, 24.5)\n- Steam engine at position(-2.5, 24.5)\n- Electric pole network connecting power to other structures\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Inventory shortage errors\n- Check inventory before attempting to insert items into machines\n- Common items running out: coal, iron ore\n- Keep track of raw material levels and harvest more when running low\n\n### Entity placement/access errors\n- Could not get Lab at position(0.5, 28.5) - Ensure the entity exists before trying to access it\n- Verify entity positions are correct when trying to interact with them\n\n### Resource management\n- Monitor coal levels in boiler to maintain consistent power generation\n- Keep furnaces supplied with fuel and ore to maintain continuous production\n- Track assembler ingredient levels to prevent production stoppages\n\n### Entity status monitoring\n- Pay attention to \"NO_INGREDIENTS\" warnings on furnaces\n- Monitor \"ITEM_INGREDIENT_SHORTAGE\" status on assembling machines\n- Keep track of power system status (boiler/steam engine) to maintain electricity"}
