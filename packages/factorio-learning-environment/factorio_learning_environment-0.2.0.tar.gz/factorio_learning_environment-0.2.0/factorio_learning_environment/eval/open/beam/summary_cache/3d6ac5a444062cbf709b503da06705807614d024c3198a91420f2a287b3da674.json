{"content": "The error indicates that the `nearest` function did not find any stone furnaces on the surface. This suggests that there might not be any furnaces placed in the vicinity, or the search criteria are not correctly identifying them. Here's how you can address this:\n\n### Steps to Resolve:\n\n1. **Verify Entity Existence**: Before attempting to interact with entities, ensure that they exist by checking the entire map for the desired prototype.\n\n2. **Use a Broader Search**: Instead of looking for the nearest entity, search for all entities of the desired type within a broader area to ensure detection.\n\n3. **Place a New Furnace if None Exists**: If no furnaces are found, place a new one at a specified location.\n\nHere's how you can adjust your code:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Check for any stone furnaces on the map.\nall_furnaces = get_entities({Prototype.StoneFurnace})\nif not all_furnaces:\n    print(\"No stone furnaces found on the map. Placing a new one.\")\n    # Place a new furnace at a default position if none exist.\n    default_position = Position(0.0, 0.0)\n    move_to(default_position)\n    new_furnace = place_entity(Prototype.StoneFurnace, position=default_position)\n    print(\"New furnace placed at:\", new_furnace.position)\nelse:\n    # If furnaces exist, work with the first one found.\n    current_furnace = all_furnaces[0]\n    print(\"Found existing furnace at:\", current_furnace.position)\n    move_to(current_furnace.position)\n    pickup_entity(current_furnace)\n    print(\"Picked up existing furnace for reset.\")\n    reset_furnace = place_entity(Prototype.StoneFurnace, position=current_furnace.position)\n    print(\"Placed a new furnace at the same position:\", reset_furnace.position)\n\n# Step 2: Verify the player's coal inventory.\nplayer_inventory = inspect_inventory()\ncoal_count = player_inventory.get(Prototype.Coal, 0)\nassert coal_count > 0, f\"Insufficient coal in player inventory, found: {coal_count}\"\n\n# Step 3: Insert coal into the furnace.\ntry:\n    print(\"Attempting to insert coal into the furnace...\")\n    insert_item(Prototype.Coal, reset_furnace, quantity=1)\n    print(\"Coal successfully inserted.\")\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(\"Error during coal insertion:\", e)\n\n# Step 4: Check furnace inventory after coal insertion.\nfinal_furnace_inventory = inspect_inventory(reset_furnace)\nprint(\"Final Furnace Inventory Check:\", final_furnace_inventory)\n\n# Validate that the coal is properly inserted.\nassert final_furnace_inventory.get(Prototype.Coal, 0) > 0, \"Coal insertion result not reflecting accurately.\"\n\n# Final status of player's inventory for thorough assessment.\nprint(\"Complete Player Inventory Review:\", inspect_inventory())\n\n# Overview of all entities for ensuring proper operations continue.\nprint(\"Entity State Overview:\", get_entities())\n```\n\n### Key Adjustments:\n- **Check for Existing Furnaces**: Use `get_entities` to check if any furnaces exist before proceeding.\n- **Place New Furnace if None Found**: If no furnaces are found, place a new one at a default position.\n- **Broader Search**: Instead of relying on `nearest`, use a broader search to ensure detection of entities.\n\nThis approach should help you manage the furnace even if none are initially present on the map.", "summary_range": "[1-132]"}
