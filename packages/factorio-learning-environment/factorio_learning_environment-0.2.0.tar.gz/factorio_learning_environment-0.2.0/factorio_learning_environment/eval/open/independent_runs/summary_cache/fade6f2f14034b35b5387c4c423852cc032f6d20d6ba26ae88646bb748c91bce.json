{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (x=52.5, y=-84.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=53.0, y=-83.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=52.5, y=-84.5) storing coal.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining Facility at Position (x=-23.5, y=-69.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-23.0, y=-68.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=-23.5, y=-69.5) storing copper ore.\n- Additional Wooden Chest at position (x=-24.5, y=-67.5) currently empty.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-54.5) storing iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with a Wooden Chest at position (x=1.5, y=0.5) storing iron plates and coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=2.5, y=0.5) transferring items between chests at positions (x=1.5, y=0.5) and (x=3.5, y=0.5).\n\n### Iron Smelting Facility at Position (x=-19.0, y=-65.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-19.0, y=-65.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-20.5, y=-66.5) waiting for source items.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-16.5, y=-64.5) storing iron plates.\n\n### Belt Transport System\nConsists of the following BeltGroups:\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (x=-21.5, y=-63.5) to (x=-21.5, y=-66.5).\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (x=-16.5, y=-64.5) to (x=-12.5, y=-58.5).\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (x=-17.5, y=-62.5) to (x=-17.5, y=-64.5).\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (x=-14.5, y=-62.5) to (x=-14.5, y=-65.5).\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (x=-14.5, y=-54.5) to (x=-17.5, y=-59.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Transport Belts\n- Ensure that the transport belt path is valid and that the start and end positions are not the same. Verify the path length and ensure it is feasible before attempting to connect belts.\n\n### Errors when Using Extracting but Being Too Far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when Placing into a Tile Which is Occupied by Another Entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
