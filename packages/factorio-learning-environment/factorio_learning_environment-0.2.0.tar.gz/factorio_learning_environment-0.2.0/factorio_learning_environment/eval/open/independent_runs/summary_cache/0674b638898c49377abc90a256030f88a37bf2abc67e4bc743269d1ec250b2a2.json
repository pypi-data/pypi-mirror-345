{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (x=41.5, y=-80.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=43.0, y=-82.0)\n- Iron Chest at position (x=41.5, y=-80.5)\n- Burner Inserters at positions:\n  - (x=40.5, y=-80.5)\n  - (x=42.5, y=-80.5)\n  - (x=43.5, y=-80.5)\n  - (x=41.5, y=-78.5)\n  - (x=41.5, y=-77.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=41.5, y=-79.5)\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility at Position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n- Stone Furnaces at positions:\n  - (x=-13.0, y=-48.0)\n  - (x=-11.0, y=-48.0)\n  - (x=-9.0, y=-48.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n- Iron Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5)\n- Burner Inserters at positions:\n  - (x=-15.5, y=-48.5)\n  - (x=-14.5, y=-46.5)\n  - (x=-14.5, y=-45.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors When Placing Inserters\n- Ensure that the spacing and direction are correctly set to avoid collision with existing entities or attempting to place on non-buildable areas such as water.\n- Verify that there is no existing inserter at the intended placement position to avoid placement failure.\n\n### Errors When Extracting Items\n- Ensure the correct prototype is used when extracting items from chests. Double-check the item type and quantity before extraction.\n- Make sure the chest is not full or blocked by other entities to allow successful extraction.\n\n### Attribute and Name Errors in Code\n- Verify that all variables and functions are correctly defined and accessible within the scope. Ensure the correct use of data structures and methods.\n- Double-check for typos or incorrect references to undefined variables or functions, such as 'prototype_by_title' instead of 'prototype_by_name'.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source items are available for the inserters to transfer. Check the supply chain to ensure continuous flow of materials.\n\n### Furnaces Missing Ingredients\n- Regularly supply furnaces with the necessary ingredients to maintain production efficiency. Monitor inventory levels and automate supply if possible."}
