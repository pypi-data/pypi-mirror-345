Check for existing pipes and their connections.\n\n### Errors when inserting items\n- Make sure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into any entity. In this case, ensure you have coal to fuel the boiler.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity on a tile before attempting to place it. Check for existing entities in the target position."}
