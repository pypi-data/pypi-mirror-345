Regularly check and refill fuel supplies.\n- **Full Chests**: Empty chests that are full to allow mining drills and other entities to continue operating. Regularly manage inventory to prevent blockages.\n\n#### Errors related to inserter operations\n- **Waiting for Source Items**: Ensure that inserters have access to the items they need to transfer. Check the source entities and ensure they are operational and have items available.\n\n#### General tips\n- **Regular Maintenance**: Periodically check all entities for warnings or errors and address them promptly to maintain smooth operations.\n- **Inventory Management**: Keep track of inventory levels in chests and ensure that resources are distributed efficiently to avoid shortages or overflows."}
