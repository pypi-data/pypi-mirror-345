{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line at position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of 4 parallel smelting units:\n- Furnace at (0.0, 0.0) with input inserter at (0.5, -1.5) and output inserter at (0.5, 1.5)\n- Furnace at (2.0, 0.0) with input inserter at (2.5, -1.5) and output inserter at (2.5, 1.5)\n- Furnace at (4.0, 0.0) with input inserter at (4.5, -1.5) and output inserter at (4.5, 1.5)\n- Furnace at (6.0, 0.0) with input inserter at (6.5, -1.5) and output inserter at (6.5, 1.5)\nEach unit has input storage chest at y=-2.5 and output storage chest at y=2.5\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Complex at position(-8.0, -59.0)\nConsists of:\n- Three burner mining drills at (-10.0, -59.0), (-8.0, -59.0), (-6.0, -59.0)\n- Storage chests at (-9.5, -57.5), (-7.5, -57.5), (-5.5, -57.5)\n- Transport belt network connecting the mining drills\n- Multiple inserters moving ore between components\n\n### Iron Smelting Setup at position(-23.0, -58.0)\nConsists of:\n- Two furnaces at (-23.0, -58.0) and (-21.0, -58.0)\n- Input inserter at (-22.5, -56.5)\n- Output storage chest at (-22.5, -55.5)\n\n### Copper Processing Area at position(-28.0, -61.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-28.0, -61.0)\n- Furnace at (-27.0, -59.0)\n- Input inserter at (-28.5, -58.5)\n- Output chest at (-24.5, -58.5)\n- Output inserter at (-25.5, -58.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Transport Belt Blockage Issues\n- Clear blocked transport belts at (-9.5, -55.5) and (-5.5, -55.5) to allow mining operations to continue\n- Ensure transport belt systems have proper output paths to prevent backups\n\n### Furnace Space Management\n- Ensure furnaces have clear output paths before inserting new materials\n- Multiple furnaces showing \"blocked\" warnings due to output congestion\n\n### Inserter Operation Issues\n- Several inserters waiting for source items - ensure proper material flow to input chests\n- Inserters showing \"waiting for space in destination\" - clear output blockages\n\n### Resource Distribution\n- Ensure even coal distribution to all burner devices\n- Some burner inserters are running low on fuel which could cause system stoppage"}
