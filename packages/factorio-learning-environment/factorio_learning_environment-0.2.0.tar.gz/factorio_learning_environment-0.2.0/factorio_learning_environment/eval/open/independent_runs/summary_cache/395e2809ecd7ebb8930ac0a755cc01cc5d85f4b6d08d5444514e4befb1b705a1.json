{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) which extracts iron ore and deposits it into a nearby chest.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-14.5, -48.5) and (-15.5, -48.5) used for storing extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5) which transfers items from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0) which processes iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Additional Burner Inserter** at position (-14.5, -47.5) which assists in moving items between entities.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Undefined Variable Errors\n- Ensure that all variables are defined before use. For instance, the error \"NameError: name 'plate_inserter' is not defined\" suggests that 'plate_inserter' was referenced without being defined. Double-check variable names and ensure they are initialized.\n\n### Errors Related to Missing Entities\n- Verify the existence of entities before attempting operations on them. The error \"Could not extract iron-ore from wooden-chest at (-14.5, -48.5)\" indicates that the specified chest was not found or did not contain the expected items. Ensure that the entity exists and contains the necessary resources before extraction.\n\n### Errors Due to Insufficient Fuel or Ingredients\n- Regularly check fuel levels and ingredient availability in processing entities like furnaces. The message \"Furnace is missing ingredients or fuel\" suggests that the furnace was not operating due to a lack of necessary resources. Maintain adequate fuel and input materials to ensure continuous operation.\n\n### Warnings About Full Storage\n- Monitor storage capacities to prevent overflow. The warning \"chest at drop position is full. Empty the chest at (-14.5, -48.5) to continue mining\" indicates that the storage is full, halting further operations. Regularly clear or expand storage to accommodate ongoing production."}
