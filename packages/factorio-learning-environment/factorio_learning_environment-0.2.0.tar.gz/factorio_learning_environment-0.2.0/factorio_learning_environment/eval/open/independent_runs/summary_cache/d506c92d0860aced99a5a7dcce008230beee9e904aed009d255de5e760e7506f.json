{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with a fuel inventory containing coal and a source inventory containing iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (1.5, 0.5) that moves items from a chest at position (2.5, 0.5) to the furnace.\n- Wooden Chest at position (2.5, 0.5) used for storing items.\n- Burner Inserter at position (3.5, 0.5) that moves items from the chest at position (2.5, 0.5) to a transport belt.\n- Transport Belt from position (3.5, 0.5) to (5.5, 0.5) connecting to another Burner Inserter.\n- Burner Inserter at position (6.5, 0.5) that moves items from the transport belt to a chest at position (7.5, 0.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (7.5, 0.5) storing iron plates.\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (10.0, 0.0) with a fuel inventory containing coal and a source inventory containing copper ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (11.5, 0.5) that moves items from the furnace to a chest at position (12.5, 0.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (12.5, 0.5) storing copper plates.\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) with a fuel inventory containing coal, extracting coal and dropping it into a chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (40.5, -83.5) storing extracted coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (42.5, -83.5) used for additional coal storage.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when extracting items due to full inventory\n- Ensure there is enough space in the inventory before attempting to extract items. Consider transferring items to a chest or using them in production to free up space.\n\n### Errors when extracting items from non-existent entities\n- Verify the presence of the target entity before attempting to extract items. Ensure the entity contains the items you intend to extract.\n\n### Errors due to inserter waiting for source items\n- Ensure that the source entity has the necessary items to be transferred by the inserter. Regularly check and supply the source entity to avoid waiting states.\n\n### Errors due to blockage in transport belts or inserters\n- Regularly clear blockages by ensuring destination entities have enough space to receive items. Consider expanding storage or using additional chests to prevent blockages."}
