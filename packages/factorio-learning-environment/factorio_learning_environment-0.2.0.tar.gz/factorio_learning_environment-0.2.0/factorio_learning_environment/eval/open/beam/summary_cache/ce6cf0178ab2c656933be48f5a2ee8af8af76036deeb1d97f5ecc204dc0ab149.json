{"content": "It appears that my last attempt to find a valid build location for the Stone Furnace did not yield any output or error messages, which suggests that the action may have been successful or that there was no valid position found. \n\nTo ensure that I can successfully place the Stone Furnace, I should take the following steps:\n\n1. **Verify Resource Availability**: Before attempting to place the furnace, I should check if I have the necessary materials in my inventory to craft the Stone Furnace. This includes ensuring I have enough stone and any other required components.\n\n2. **Check Current Position**: I need to confirm my current position to ensure that I am indeed close enough to the stone patch to place the furnace. If I am still too far away, I will need to move closer.\n\n3. **Use `nearest_buildable` Correctly**: If I did not find a valid position, I should ensure that I am using the `nearest_buildable` function correctly and that it is being called with the correct parameters.\n\n4. **Error Handling**: If no valid position is found, I should handle this gracefully by providing feedback and possibly trying to find another nearby resource or location.\n\n5. **Movement Logic**: If I am still too far from the stone patch, I should use the `move_to` function to get closer to the resource before attempting to place the furnace again.\n\nBy following these steps, I can avoid the errors encountered previously and ensure that I can successfully place the Stone Furnace. \n\nNext, I will check my inventory for the required materials and confirm my current position. If everything is in order, I will attempt to find a valid position for the furnace again.", "summary_range": "[1-68]"}
