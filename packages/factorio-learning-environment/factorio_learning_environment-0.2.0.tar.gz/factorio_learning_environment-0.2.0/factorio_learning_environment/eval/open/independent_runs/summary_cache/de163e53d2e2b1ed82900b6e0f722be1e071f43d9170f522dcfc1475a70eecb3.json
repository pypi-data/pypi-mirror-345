This structure supports the production of intermediate resources needed for lab crafting.\n\n### Copper Smelting Furnace at Position(-27.0, -60.0)\nConsists of a furnace utilized for processing copper ore into copper plates. It underpins the conversion needed for producing copper cables and other sub-ingredients required for lab crafting.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 API Call Usage\n  - Use the correct signature for get_entities. Avoid unsupported keyword arguments (e.g. \u2018radius\u2019) and supplying positional parameters when none are expected.\n\n\u2022 Lab Placement\n  - Confirm that a Lab is available in the inventory before attempting placement. Verify that the target location is unoccupied to ensure successful placement.\n\n\u2022 Lab Crafting Dependencies\n  - Ensure that all required sub-ingredients (such as iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, and copper-cables) are available or producible. Address the cascading crafting dependencies before initiating Lab production.\n\n\u2022 Handling None Values\n  - Check that functions returning collections (like get_entities) do not return None before iterating over them; use an empty list as a fallback if necessary."}
