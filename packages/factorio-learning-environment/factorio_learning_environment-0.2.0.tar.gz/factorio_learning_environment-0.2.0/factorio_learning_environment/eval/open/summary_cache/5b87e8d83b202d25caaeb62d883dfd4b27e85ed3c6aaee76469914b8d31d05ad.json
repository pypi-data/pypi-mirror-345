{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron plate production setup at position around (16.0, 71.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (16.0, 71.0) facing down, extracting iron ore.\n- Stone furnace at position (16.0, 73.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden chest at position (17.5, 73.5) collecting iron plates from the furnace.\n- Burner inserter at position (16.5, 74.5) transferring iron ore from the mining drill to the furnace.\n- Burner inserter at position (18.5, 73.5) moving iron plates from the furnace to the wooden chest.\n- Burner inserter at position (19.5, 73.5) moving iron plates from the wooden chest to a transport belt.\n- Transport belt at position (21.5, 73.5) moving iron plates away from the chest.\n\nThis structure forms a connected iron plate production line from ore extraction to plate output onto a belt.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Fuel management for burner inserters and furnace\n- Burner inserters and furnaces require coal fuel to operate. Ensure coal is consistently inserted into these entities to avoid stoppages.\n- Track coal inventory carefully and insert coal promptly; repeated errors occurred due to lack of coal in inventory or failure to insert coal into burner inserters.\n- Consider maintaining a dedicated coal supply line or buffer chest to prevent fuel shortages.\n\n### Item insertion errors due to empty inventory\n- Attempts to insert coal into burner inserters or other entities failed multiple times because the inventory was empty despite having harvested coal.\n- Verify inventory contents before attempting insertion to avoid exceptions.\n- Implement checks or waits until sufficient coal is harvested and available before insertion commands.\n\n### Inserter operation and blockage issues\n- Inserters frequently entered WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS or WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION states, indicating upstream or downstream blockages.\n- The burner inserter at (19.5, 73.5) often lacked fuel, causing it to stop moving items onto the belt, leading to output blockage warnings on the mining drill.\n- Ensure continuous fuel supply and clear output paths to maintain smooth item flow.\n\n### Entity placement and spacing\n- Initial belt placement next to the chest failed due to occupied tiles but was resolved by placing the belt at (21.5, 73.5) with spacing.\n- Plan entity placement carefully to avoid overlaps and blocked outputs, especially around inserters and chests.\n\nNAMESPACE\nNo user-defined functions have been declared yet."}
