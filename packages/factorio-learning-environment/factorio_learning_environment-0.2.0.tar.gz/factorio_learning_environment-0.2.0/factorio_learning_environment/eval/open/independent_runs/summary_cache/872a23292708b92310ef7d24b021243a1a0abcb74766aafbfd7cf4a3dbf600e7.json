Specifically, the 'direction' attribute is missing in the BeltGroup object. Check the BeltGroup class definition and ensure that all expected attributes are present and correctly assigned.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
