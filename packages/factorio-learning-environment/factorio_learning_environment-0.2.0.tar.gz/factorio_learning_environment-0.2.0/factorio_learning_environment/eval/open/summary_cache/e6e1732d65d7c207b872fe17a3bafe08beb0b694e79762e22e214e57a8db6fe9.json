{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron ore mining and smelting structure at position around (17.5, 72.5)\nConsists of the following connected entities:\n- Electric mining drill at position (17.5, 72.5) facing down, powered but output blocked due to furnace belt blockage.\n- Stone furnace at position (18.0, 75.0) fueled with coal, smelting iron ore; output inventory frequently full.\n- Three wooden chests at positions (19.5, 75.5), (21.5, 75.5), and (21.5, 77.5) serving as intermediate and output storage for iron plates.\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5) and (20.5, 77.5) fueled and operational, moving items between furnace and chests.\n- Small electric pole at (15.5, 75.5) connected to power network.\n- Persistent output belt blockage at furnace drop position continues to affect mining drill operation.\n\nThis structure enables iron ore extraction, smelting, and staged storage of iron plates with stable power and inserter fueling, but output congestion remains unresolved.\n\n### Steam power generation structure at position around (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, -0.5) extracting water.\n- Boiler at (-5.0, 2.5) fueled with coal, currently out of fuel as of latest logs.\n- Steam engine at (0.5, 6.5) connected by pipes to boiler, generating power.\n- Small electric poles placed near steam engine (0.5, 6.5), boiler (-4.5, -0.5), and newly placed pole at (17.5, 72.5), all connected to power network.\n\nThis structure reliably generates electricity from steam power but requires consistent fueling of the boiler to maintain operation.\n\n### Iron gear wheel assembly structure at position around (25.5, 80.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine 2 at (25.5, 80.5) powered and connected to small electric pole at (25.5, 80.5).\n- Input wooden chest at (21.5, 75.5) supplying iron plates directly into assembler input.\n- Output wooden chest at (25.5, 82.5) intended for assembled iron gear wheels; currently empty.\n- Burner inserter at (25.5, 83.5) fueled and operational, transferring items to output chest.\n- Inserters at (20.5, 77.5) and (25.5, 83.5) fueled and working.\n- Assembling machine repeatedly reports shortage of iron plates preventing crafting despite input chest having iron plates.\n\nThis structure is set up for iron gear wheel production with power and inserters in place, but the assembler input inventory remains empty, indicating a supply or insertion issue.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Persistent output blockage at furnace output\n- The electric mining drill at (17.5, 72.5) continues to report \"furnace belt at drop position is blocked,\" and the furnace output inventory is frequently full.\n- This blockage prevents smooth item flow and halts mining drill output.\n- To resolve, clear or extend the output belts and ensure chests or belts downstream have capacity to accept items.\n- Verify inserters and belts are correctly positioned and not backed up.\n\n### Inserter and inventory management for assembling machine\n- Despite iron plates being inserted into the input chest at (21.5, 75.5), the assembling machine at (25.5, 80.5) input inventory remains empty.\n- This suggests inserters feeding the assembler input chest or the assembler itself are not transferring items properly.\n- Check inserter pickup and drop positions, ensure inserters are powered and fueled, and verify no output blockage in the assembler output chest.\n- Confirm the assembler recipe matches the input materials and that the input chest contains the required items.\n\n### Entity placement conflicts due to occupied tiles\n- Attempts to place small electric poles near (18.0, 75.0) and furnace output positions failed due to existing entities blocking placement.\n- Specifically, collisions with mining drill at (17.5, 72.5) and other nearby entities prevent pole or chest placement.\n- To avoid these errors, verify tile occupancy before placement, increase spacing, adjust direction, or select alternate nearby positions.\n\n### Boiler fueling and power generation interruptions\n- The boiler at (-5.0, 2.5) ran out of fuel during recent steps, causing it to stop and the steam engine to potentially lose power.\n- Maintain consistent coal supply to the boiler to ensure uninterrupted steam and power generation.\n- Monitor fuel inventories and inserter fueling for the boiler.\n\nNAMESPACE  \nNo user-defined functions have been declared or invoked in the provided logs."}
