Always verify the target\u2019s type before attempting a connection.\n\n\u2022 Entity Placement Issues  \n\u2003\u2013 Placement out-of-range errors occur when the player is too far from the target position. Ensure you move within the allowed placement range (max distance 10) before placing an entity.  \n\u2003\u2013 Inventory-related errors (e.g. missing wooden chest) can be avoided by checking the inventory for required items prior to placement.  \n\u2003\u2013 Undefined variable errors (such as \u201ctarget_chest\u201d not defined) indicate that all target variables must be correctly assigned and referenced before use."}
