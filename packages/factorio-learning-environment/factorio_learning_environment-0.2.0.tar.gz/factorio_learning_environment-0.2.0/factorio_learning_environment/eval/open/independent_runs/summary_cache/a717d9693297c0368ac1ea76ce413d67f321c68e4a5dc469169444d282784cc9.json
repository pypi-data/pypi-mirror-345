{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n  - Status: Out of fuel\n  - Resources: 10,000 iron ore\n  - Warnings: Chest at drop position is full. Empty the chest at (-14.5, -48.5) to continue mining.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-15.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Status: Normal\n  - Inventory: Empty\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Status: Normal\n  - Inventory: Contains iron ore\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Fuel: Coal (5 units)\n  - Furnace Source: Iron ore (4 units)\n  - Furnace Result: Iron plates (92 units)\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5)\n  - Status: Waiting for source items\n  - Fuel: Coal (4 units)\n  - Pickup Position: (x=-14.5, y=-46.5)\n  - Drop Position: (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Fuel\n- Ensure that all fuel-dependent entities, such as burner mining drills and inserters, are adequately refueled to maintain continuous operation. Regularly check fuel levels and replenish as necessary.\n\n### Errors Due to Full Chests\n- Monitor the inventory levels of chests regularly to prevent them from becoming full. Ensure that there is a system in place to transfer or utilize the contents of the chests to avoid halting production processes.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Operations\n- Ensure that inserters have clear access to both the source and destination entities. Verify that the pickup and drop positions are correctly aligned with the entities they are intended to interact with.\n\nBy addressing these errors, the efficiency and productivity of your operations can be significantly improved."}
