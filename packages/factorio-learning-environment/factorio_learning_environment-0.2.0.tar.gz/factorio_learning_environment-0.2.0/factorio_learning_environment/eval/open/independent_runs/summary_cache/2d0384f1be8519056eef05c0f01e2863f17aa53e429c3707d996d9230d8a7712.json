{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, -60.0) with a drop position at (4.5, -58.5), extracting iron ore and depositing into a chest.\n- **Furnaces** at positions (-15.0, -48.0), (-13.0, -48.0), and (-11.0, -48.0), each fueled with coal and processing iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Storage System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Wooden Chests** at various positions, including (4.5, -58.5), (5.5, -60.5), (7.5, -60.5), and others, used for storing extracted resources and processed materials.\n- **Iron Chests** at positions (-6.5, -50.5) and (-5.5, -50.5), used for storing iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Chest Full Warnings\n- Ensure to regularly check and empty chests that are full to prevent interruptions in the production process. Specifically, the chest at drop position (4.5, -58.5) needs to be emptied to continue mining.\n\n### No Ingredients in Furnaces\n- Maintain a steady supply of iron ore to the furnaces to avoid the \"NO_INGREDIENTS\" status. Ensure that the input chest is not empty and that the supply chain is uninterrupted.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined in the current steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `iron_ore_count: int` - Tracks the amount of iron ore available in the inventory.\n- `iron_plate_count: int` - Tracks the amount of iron plates produced and stored.\n- `coal_count: int` - Tracks the amount of coal available for fueling furnaces and drills.\n\nThis report provides a comprehensive overview of the current structures and potential improvements to optimize the agent's operations in the game."}
