{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at Position (x=17.5, y=20.5) with warnings of 'no input liquid' and 'no fluid present in connections', currently not connected.\n- Boiler at Position (x=1.5, y=23.0) with a warning of 'out of fuel', connected to several pipes.\n- Offshore Pump at Position (x=-9.5, y=24.5), currently working and providing water to the system.\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- PipeGroup at Position (x=9.5, y=15.5) with status EMPTY, consisting of multiple pipes connecting various positions.\n- PipeGroup at Position (x=6.5, y=21.5) with status EMPTY, consisting of multiple pipes.\n- PipeGroup at Position (x=-9.5, y=23.5) with status FULL_OUTPUT, transporting water from the offshore pump.\n\n### Electricity Network\n- ElectricityGroup with ID 44221, consisting of poles at various positions, currently with voltage 0.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure that the entities you are trying to connect are compatible and that there are no obstructions in the path. Verify the positions and types of entities before attempting to connect them.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Fuel\n- Regularly check the fuel status of boilers and other fuel-dependent entities to ensure they are operational. Maintain a sufficient inventory of fuel.\n\n### Errors with Steam Engine Not Receiving Input\n- Verify the connections between the steam engine and its input sources such as boilers and pipes. Ensure that the fluid system is properly configured and connected.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `connect_entities(Position, Position, Set[Prototype])`: Attempts to connect two entities using specified prototypes. Ensure that the entities are compatible and the path is clear.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `pipes`: List of connected pipes, defined using the `connect_entities` function.\n- `inventory`: Dictionary containing the current inventory of items such as 'wooden-chest', 'burner-inserter', 'small-electric-pole', etc."}
