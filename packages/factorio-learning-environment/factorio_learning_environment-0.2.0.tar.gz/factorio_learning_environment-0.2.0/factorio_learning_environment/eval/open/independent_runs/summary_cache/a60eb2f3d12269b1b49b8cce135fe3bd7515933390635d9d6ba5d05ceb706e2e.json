{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-14.5, -48.5), (-15.5, -48.5) for storing extracted materials.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5) transferring materials from the mining drill to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (-12.0, -48.0) and (-10.0, -48.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Additional Wooden Chests** at positions (-6.5, -48.5), (-6.5, -49.5), (-4.5, -48.5), (-3.5, -48.5) for storing iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserters** at various positions for transferring materials between entities.\n\n### Storage and Inserter Network\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-12.5, -51.5), (-14.5, -46.5), (-7.5, -47.5), (-6.5, -47.5) for storing various materials.\n- **Burner Inserters** at positions (-14.5, -47.5), (-11.5, -46.5), (-11.5, -45.5), (-11.5, -44.5), (-9.5, -46.5), (-9.5, -45.5), (-9.5, -44.5), (-11.5, -43.5), (-9.5, -43.5) for transferring items between chests and furnaces.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Crafting Errors\n- **Iron Gear Wheel Crafting Failures**: Ensure that all necessary materials are available in your inventory before attempting to craft items.\n\n### Placement Errors\n- **Inserter Placement Conflicts**: Before placing an inserter, check that the target position is unoccupied and adjust spacing or direction if necessary.\n- **Storage Chest Placement Conflicts**: Verify that the target position for placing a wooden chest is unoccupied. Remove any existing entities that block placement.\n\n### Connectivity Errors\n- **Inserter to Storage Chest Connection**: Use an inserter to input items into a wooden chest; belts cannot connect directly to chests.\n\n### Refueling Errors\n- **Refueling Failures**: Ensure that you have enough coal in your inventory before attempting to refuel entities.\n\n### Distance Errors\n- **Placement Distance**: Move closer to the target position if it is too far away for placing an entity. The maximum distance is 10 units."}
