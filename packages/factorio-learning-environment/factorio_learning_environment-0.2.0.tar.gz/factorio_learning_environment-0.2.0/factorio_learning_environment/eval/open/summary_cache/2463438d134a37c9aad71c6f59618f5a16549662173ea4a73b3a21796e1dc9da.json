{"content": "# FACTORIO REPORT\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System at position (-9.5, 1.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump (position x=-9.5, y=1.5) extracting water\n- Boiler (position x=-5.0, y=4.5) currently out of fuel\n- Steam engine (position x=0.5, y=8.5) not connected to power network\n- Pipe network connecting these components\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Operation at position (30.0, 86.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (position x=30.0, y=86.0) with coal fuel\n- Wooden chest (position x=30.5, y=87.5) collecting iron ore\n- Burner inserter (position x=31.5, y=87.5) attempting to move ore but output is blocked\n\n### Second Iron Ore Mining Operation at position (36.0, 90.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (position x=36.0, y=90.0) with coal fuel\n- Wooden chest (position x=36.5, y=91.5) collecting iron ore\n\n### Smelting Area at position (43.0, 89.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace (position x=43.0, y=89.0) with coal fuel but no ingredients\n- Second stone furnace (position x=51.0, y=92.0) with coal fuel but no ingredients\n\n### Iron Gear Wheel Production Line at position (56.5, 94.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine (position x=56.5, y=94.5) set to produce iron gear wheels\n- Input inserter (position x=54.5, y=94.5) to feed materials\n- Output inserter (position x=58.5, y=94.5) to extract products\n- Input wooden chest (position x=52.5, y=94.5) for iron plates\n- Output wooden chest (position x=59.5, y=94.5) for collecting iron gear wheels\n- Power poles connecting the assembly area (not receiving electricity)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied or unsuitable locations\n- Before placing entities, check if the target location is suitable and not occupied by other entities\n- Use the agent's position and entity information to find clear spaces for placement\n- When placing mining drills, ensure they are positioned directly over resource patches\n\n### Errors when connecting entities with transport belts\n- Transport belts cannot be connected directly to furnaces. Use inserters as intermediaries between belts and furnaces\n- Ensure proper input/output flow when designing belt systems\n\n### Errors with power connection\n- Make sure power poles are properly connected to form a continuous network from power generation to consumers\n- Verify that steam engines are properly connected to boilers with pipes and to electrical networks with power poles\n\n### Errors with fuel management\n- Keep track of fuel levels in burner devices (mining drills, inserters, boilers)\n- Refuel entities before they run out completely\n- Ensure you have sufficient coal in inventory before attempting to refuel entities\n\n### Errors with entity placement relative to resources\n- When placing mining drills, ensure they are positioned correctly over resource patches\n- Check that the drop position of mining drills is accessible by inserters or chests"}
