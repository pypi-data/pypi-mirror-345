{"content": "The error indicates that the player is too far from the target position to place the Boiler. This is a common issue when trying to place entities at a distance greater than the allowed maximum. Here's how to resolve it:\n\n### Solution Steps:\n\n1. **Move Closer to the Target Position:**\n   - Before attempting to place the Boiler, ensure that the player character is within the allowed placement range. You can achieve this by moving the player closer to the Offshore Pump and the intended Boiler location.\n\n2. **Re-attempt Placement:**\n   - Once the player is closer, try placing the Boiler again. Ensure that there is enough space around the Offshore Pump for the Boiler and that no obstructions are present.\n\n### Adjusted Code:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Move closer to the Offshore Pump and Boiler placement area\nmove_to(offshore_pump.position)\n\n# Step 2: Attempt to place the Boiler again\nboiler_position_candidates = [\n    offshore_pump.position.right(),\n    offshore_pump.position.left(),\n    offshore_pump.position.up(),\n    offshore_pump.position.down()\n]\n\nboiler = None\nfor pos in boiler_position_candidates:\n    if can_place_entity(Prototype.Boiler, position=pos):\n        boiler = place_entity(Prototype.Boiler, position=pos)\n        break\n\nif boiler:\n    print(f\"Boiler successfully placed at: {boiler.position}\")\n    insert_item(Prototype.Coal, boiler, quantity=10)  # Add initial coal for fuel\nelse:\n    raise Exception(\"Failed to find a suitable location to place the Boiler.\")\n\n# Step 3: Continue with the setup for the Steam Engine and connections\nsteam_engine_position = boiler.position.right() if can_place_entity(Prototype.SteamEngine, position=boiler.position.right()) else boiler.position.left()\nsteam_engine = place_entity(Prototype.SteamEngine, position=steam_engine_position)\nprint(f\"Steam Engine placed at: {steam_engine.position}\")\n\n# Step 4: Establish water and steam connections with proper piping\nconnect_entities(offshore_pump, boiler, Prototype.Pipe)  # Water connection\nconnect_entities(boiler, steam_engine, Prototype.Pipe)   # Steam connection\nprint(\"Water and Steam connections established successfully.\")\n\n# Step 5: Place the Small Electric Pole and connect it to power the Assembling Machine\nelectric_pole_position = steam_engine.position.right() if can_place_entity(Prototype.SmallElectricPole, position=steam_engine.position.right()) else steam_engine.position.left()\nelectric_pole = place_entity(Prototype.SmallElectricPole, position=electric_pole_position)\nprint(f\"Electric Pole installed at: {electric_pole.position}\")\n\n# Connect Steam Engine to Electric Pole\nif not connect_entities(steam_engine, electric_pole):\n    raise Exception(\"Failed to connect Steam Engine to Electric Pole.\")\n\n# Connect the Electric Pole to the Assembling Machine\nif not connect_entities(electric_pole, assembler):\n    raise Exception(\"Failed to connect Electric Pole to Assembling Machine.\")\n\n# Print the updated status of the Assembling Machine to confirm it has power now\nassembler = get_entity(Prototype.AssemblingMachine1, assembler.position)\nprint(f\"Assembling Machine's updated power status: {assembler.status}\")\n```\n\n### Tips:\n- **Always Check Proximity:** Ensure the player is within the maximum placement distance before attempting to place entities.\n- **Use `move_to()` Function:** Utilize the `move_to()` function to reposition the player closer to the desired placement area.\n- **Verify Space and Obstructions:** Ensure there is enough space and no obstructions at the intended placement location.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to successfully place the Boiler and continue with the setup process.", "summary_range": "[1-330]"}
