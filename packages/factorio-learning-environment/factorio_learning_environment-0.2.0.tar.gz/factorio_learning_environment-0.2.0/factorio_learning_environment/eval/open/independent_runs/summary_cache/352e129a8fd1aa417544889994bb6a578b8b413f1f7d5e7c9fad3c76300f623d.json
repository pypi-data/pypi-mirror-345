Align connection attempts with the updated fluid_system identifier (83875) as reflected by the final entity records.\n- Uniform Fluid_System Assignment:\n  - Ensure that all pipeline components\u2014including the boiler, offshore pump, and associated pipe groups\u2014are assigned a consistent fluid_system identifier to prevent mismatches during connection attempts.\n- Search Radius Verification:\n  - Confirm that the search radius for detecting candidate pipe groups is sufficiently large to capture nearby entities, avoiding unintended connection aborts.\n- Inventory Attribute Consistency:\n  - Maintain use of supported inventory attributes when accessing or modifying inventory items to avoid related errors."}
