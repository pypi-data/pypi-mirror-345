{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-0.5, 25.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (-0.5, 25.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-5.5, 25.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe Network connecting the Offshore Pump to the Boiler and Steam Engine, including pipe-groups at positions:\n  - Pipe-group at x=-0.5 y=16.5\n  - Pipe-group at x=-9.5 y=21.5\n  - Pipe-group at x=-8.5 y=23.5\n  - Pipe-group at x=-7.5 y=25.5\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (15.0, 0.0)\n- Inserters at Positions (17.5, 0.5) and (16.5, 0.5)\n- Wooden Chests at Positions (5.5, 0.5) and (18.5, 0.5)\n- Small Electric Pole at Position (17.5, -0.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Underground Pipe Ends\n- Ensure the target location for placing underground pipe ends is clear and correctly aligned with existing pipes to avoid placement errors.\n\n### Boiler and Steam Engine Not Connected\n- Verify that all necessary connections between the boiler, steam engine, and offshore pump are established to ensure proper functionality.\n\n### Inserter Not Receiving Electricity\n- Check that inserters are within range of an electric pole and that the electric network is powered to avoid power-related issues.\n\n### Errors when Placing Pipes on Occupied Tiles\n- Before placing a pipe, confirm that the target tile is unoccupied to prevent placement conflicts."}
