{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-7.5, 23.0)\nConsists of boiler (position -7.5, 23.0) and offshore pump (position -9.5, 24.5)\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position x1) and a furnace at position(0.0, 0.0)\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine at position(z1) and inserter at position(a) that puts into assembling machine\n- Beltgroup (position) that connects the furnace at position y1 to assembling machine at position(z1)\n\n### Furnace at position(5.0, 5.0)\nConsists of a stone furnace (position 5.0, 5.0) that has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Lab at position(unknown)\nConsists of a lab (position unknown) that is currently not powered and researching automation.\n\n### Furnace at position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of a stone furnace (position 0.0, 0.0) that is currently smelting iron plates.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to crafting items\n- Ensure that all required ingredients are available in your inventory before attempting to craft an item. For example, steam engines require iron plates, which must be smelted from iron ore.\n\n### Errors when smelting\n- Make sure to check that the furnace has enough fuel and the required ingredients before starting the smelting process. If the furnace is out of fuel or ingredients, it will not operate correctly.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
