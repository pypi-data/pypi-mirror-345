{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=42.0, y=-83.0)\n  - Status: Waiting for space in destination\n  - Warnings: Output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Resources: Coal (39999 units)\n  - Drop Position: (x=42.5, y=-81.5)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-15.0, y=-49.0)\n  - Status: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Furnace Result: Iron Plate (81 units)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied positions\n- Ensure the intended position for placing entities like Wooden Chests and Burner Inserters is unoccupied. Check the map for existing entities or obstructions before attempting to place new structures.\n\n### Errors due to blocked output\n- Ensure that the output of entities such as Burner Mining Drills is not blocked. Place a sink entity, such as a chest or conveyor belt, to accept the output and prevent blockage.\n\n### Errors due to missing ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to process. Regularly check the furnace inventory and supply it with the required raw materials to maintain production efficiency."}
