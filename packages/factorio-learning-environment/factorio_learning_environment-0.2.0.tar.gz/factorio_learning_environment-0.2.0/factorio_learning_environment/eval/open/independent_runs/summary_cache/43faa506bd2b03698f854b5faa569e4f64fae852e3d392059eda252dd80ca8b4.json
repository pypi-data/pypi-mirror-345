Each furnace is paired with burner\u2011inserters and a wooden chest, forming an automated network that feeds raw ore into smelting processes.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Automation Setup\nConsists of:\n\u2022 A burner\u2011mining drill at (\u201315.0, \u201350.0) that extracts iron\u2011ore.\n\u2022 A wooden chest at (\u201313.5, \u201351.5) to collect the mined resource.\n\u2022 Transport belts connecting the drill to the chest.\n\n### Steam Power Generation System\nConsists of:\n\u2022 A boiler at (8.0, 20.5) with connection points near (8.5, 18.5) and (8.5, 22.5).\n\u2022 A network of steam engines deployed at (0.5, 9.5), (18.5, 11.5), (1.5, 13.5), (13.5, 14.5), (19.5, 14.5), (22.5, 18.5), (17.5, 20.5), (12.5, 21.5), and (4.5, 23.5).\n\u2022 An extra steam engine intended to join the network remains unplaceable due to persistent congestion around the boiler area.\n\n### Automation Research Lab\nConsists of:\n\u2022 A laboratory configured for processing automation science packs. Diagnostics confirm that the lab remains unpowered.\n\n### Electrical and Transport Infrastructure\nConsists of:\n\u2022 Multiple interlinked Electricity Groups (composed of power poles and connection nodes) that maintain the base\u2019s power network.\n\u2022 Various Belt Groups and Pipe Groups ensuring material and fluid connectivity across the facility.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 Persistent Extra Steam Engine Placement Error\n\u2003\u2013 Issue: The extra steam engine consistently fails to be placed because the designated area is severely congested. The boiler area at (8.0, 20.5) is cluttered with overlapping burner\u2011inserters, transport belts, and other interfering entities, while the buildable space near (8.5, 22.5) remains obstructed.\n\u2003\u2013 Recommendation: Manual intervention is required. Thoroughly inspect the boiler area and adjacent connection interfaces; remove, reposition, or adjust interfering entities to create sufficient clearance. Alternatively, relocate the extra steam engine to a dedicated area away from the congested zone or modify the boiler layout to improve spacing.\n\n\u2022 Fuel and Source Item Shortages on Burner\u2011Inserters\n\u2003\u2013 Issue: Several burner\u2011inserters show \u201cno fuel\u201d warnings and are awaiting source items, which disrupts their proper operation.\n\u2003\u2013 Recommendation: Review and optimize fuel supply routes and item delivery. Reposition or reconfigure these inserters as needed to ensure a stable resource flow.\n\n\u2022 Connectivity Gaps in the Steam Engine Network\n\u2003\u2013 Issue: A number of steam engines are not properly connected to the power network and lack adequate liquid inputs, which undermines power generation.\n\u2003\u2013 Recommendation: Confirm that all connection points between the boiler, steam engines, and the fluid system are correctly aligned and unobstructed. Adjust nearby entities where necessary to restore proper connectivity."}
