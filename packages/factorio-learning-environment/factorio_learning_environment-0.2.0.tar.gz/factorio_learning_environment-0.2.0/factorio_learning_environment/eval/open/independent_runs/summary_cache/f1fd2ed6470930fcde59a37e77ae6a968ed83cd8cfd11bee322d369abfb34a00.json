{"content": "## Report\n\n### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Electricity Generator at Position (-10.5, 25.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-10.5, 25.5)\n- Boiler at position (-14.5, 20.0) and another at position (-11.5, 20.0)\n- Steam Engine at position (-4.5, 22.5) and another at position (-1.5, 22.5)\n\n#### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Furnaces at positions (-14.0, -49.0) and (-12.0, -48.0)\n- Burner Inserters at positions (-13.5, -47.5), (-14.5, -45.5), (-11.5, -45.5), (-9.5, -44.5), and (-14.5, -43.5)\n- Wooden Chests at positions (-13.5, -46.5), (-13.5, -44.5), and (-9.5, -43.5)\n- Iron Chest at position (-11.5, -44.5)\n- Belt Group connecting various entities for material transport\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors in Connecting Offshore Pump to Boiler\n- Ensure that the correct type of pipe is used to connect the offshore pump to the boiler. Verify that the connection path is clear and that the correct type of pipe is used, whether it is a regular pipe or an underground pipe.\n\n#### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Check that the inserters have a continuous supply of source items. Ensure that the belts feeding the inserters are not blocked or empty, and that the source items are available in the expected location.\n\n#### Furnace Missing Ingredients\n- Ensure that the furnaces have a steady supply of raw materials. Verify that the input belts or inserters are correctly configured and that there is a sufficient supply of raw materials being fed into the furnaces.\n\n#### Steam Engine Not Connected to Power Network\n- Make sure that the steam engines are properly connected to the power network. Check the connections between the steam engines and the electric poles to ensure that they are correctly linked and that the power network is complete.\n\n#### Inserter Output Blocked\n- Ensure that the destination for the inserter output is not blocked. Verify that there is space available for the inserter to place its output, and that there is a valid sink entity to accept the output."}
