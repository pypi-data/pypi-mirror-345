{"content": "Here's the updated report incorporating steps 112-119:\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Functional Iron Mining Operation at (16.0, 72.0)\n- Current components:\n  - Burner mining drill at (16.0, 72.0) (working with 10 coal)\n  - Wooden chest at (17.5, 71.5) (contains 6 iron ore)\n- Operational status:\n  - Stable production of 25 iron ore/minute\n  - Output system needs automation\n\n### Power Plant at (-9.5, -0.5)\n- Current components:\n  - Offshore pump at (-9.5, -0.5)\n  - Boiler at (-7.0, 0.5) (14 coal fuel)\n  - Steam engine at (-2.5, 0.5)\n  - Pipe network connecting components\n- Operational status:\n  - Generating 15000 energy\n  - Steam engine not connected to power network\n  - Fluid systems working properly\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Placement Collision Errors (Critical Recurring)\n- Multiple inserter placement failures (steps 113,115)\n- Required fixes:\n  1. Implement complete area scanning before placement\n  2. Add collision detection for all entity types\n  3. Create placement validation system\n\n### Belt Connection Errors (Persistent)\n- Direct chest-to-belt connection attempt (step 114)\n- Solutions:\n  1. Always use inserters between containers and belts\n  2. Verify connection types before placement\n  3. Implement proper belt connection validation\n\n### Power System Issues (New)\n- Steam engine not connected (step 119)\n- Required:\n  1. Connect steam engine to power poles\n  2. Verify power network connectivity\n  3. Check electric network coverage\n\n### Type Handling Errors (New)\n- PipeGroup length check failure (step 118)\n- Solutions:\n  1. Add proper type checking\n  2. Implement system-specific validation\n  3. Handle group objects appropriately\n\n### Output Management (Improved)\n- Successful output clearing (steps 116,119)\n- Still needs:\n  1. Automated output system\n  2. Regular chest emptying\n  3. Throughput monitoring\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Defined Functions\n1. `build_verified_mining(resource_type: Resource) -> Entity`\n   - Successfully built mining operation (step 112)\n   - Still needs collision handling\n\n2. `fix_mining_output() -> None`\n   - Partial success (steps 116,119)\n   - Needs automation improvements\n\n3. `verify_resource_patch(position: Position) -> bool`\n   - Working correctly (step 112)\n   - Needs range extension\n\n### Important Variables\n- `mining_pos: Position` (current mining location)\n- `power_plant_pos: Position` (new power plant location)\n- `throughput: Dict[Resource, int]` (production tracking)"}
