{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\nConsists of:\n- Boiler at position (-5.5, 24.0)\n- Steam Engine at position (-1.5, 24.5)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe Group connecting these entities, with key positions including (-9.5, 23.5), (-8.5, 23.5), and (-7.5, 24.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (6.0, -62.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (6.0, -62.0) with a fuel source of coal and producing iron plates\n\n### Inserter and Storage System at Position (6.5, -60.5)\nConsists of:\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) connected to a small electric pole but not receiving power\n- Wooden Chest at position (7.5, -61.5) and another at position (6.5, -59.5) for storage\n\n### Research Lab at Position (Unknown)\nConsists of:\n- Lab with no research in progress, connected to electricity group 370026\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Electricity Connection\n- Ensure that all entities requiring power are within the range of an active electricity group. Verify that the electricity group is powered and correctly connected to the entities.\n- When connecting an inserter to power, double-check that it is receiving electricity to avoid the \"Inserter still has no power\" error.\n\n### Errors When Asserting Entity Status\n- Before asserting the status of an entity, confirm that all necessary conditions for its operation are met, such as power supply and connectivity."}
