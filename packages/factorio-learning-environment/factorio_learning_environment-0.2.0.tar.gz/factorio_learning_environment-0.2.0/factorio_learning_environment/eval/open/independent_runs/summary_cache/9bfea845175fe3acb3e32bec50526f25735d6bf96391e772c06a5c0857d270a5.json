{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-9.5, 24.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Boiler at position (-21.5, 28.0)\n- Pipe connections between offshore pump and boiler\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(0, 0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at position (0, 0) and a furnace at position (0, 0)\n\n### Copper cable factory at position(5, 5)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at position (5, 5) and a furnace at position (5, 5)\n- Assembling machine at position (5, 5) and inserter at position (5, 5) that puts into the assembling machine\n- Beltgroup connecting the furnace at position (5, 5) to the assembling machine at position (5, 5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting boiler to offshore pump\n- Ensure there are no placement blockages when attempting to connect pipes. Check the surrounding area for any entities that may obstruct the connection.\n\n### Errors when dealing with electricity groups\n- Verify that electricity groups are properly plugged into the electric network before attempting to connect other entities. If an electricity group is not plugged in, it may cause connection failures.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity on a tile before attempting to place it. Check for existing entities that may occupy the intended tile."}
