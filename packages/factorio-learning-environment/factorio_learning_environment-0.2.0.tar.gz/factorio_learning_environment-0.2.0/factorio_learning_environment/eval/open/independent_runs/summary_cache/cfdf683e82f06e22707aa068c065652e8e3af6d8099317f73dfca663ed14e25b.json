{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (4.0, -60.0) connected to a wooden chest at position (4.5, -58.5) for iron ore collection.\n- Iron Chest at position (-5.5, -50.5) used for storing extracted iron ore.\n- Stone Furnaces at positions (-15.0, -48.0), (-13.0, -48.0), and (-11.0, -48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Multiple Wooden Chests at positions (-11.5, -50.5), (-10.5, -50.5), (-9.5, -50.5), (-8.5, -50.5), and (-7.5, -50.5) storing iron plates. Note that some chests are full.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### AttributeError when accessing inventory\n- Ensure that the object you are trying to access has the method or attribute you are calling. In this case, verify that the 'inventory' is being accessed on a valid object that supports the 'get' method.\n\n### Warnings for full chests\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are full to prevent production halts. For instance, the chest at position (4.5, -58.5) needs to be emptied to continue mining.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- Utility Functions:\n  - No utility functions were defined or invoked in the provided steps.\n\n- Important Variables:\n  - `current_storage_capacity`: Intended to calculate the sum of iron plates in storage, but encountered an error due to incorrect object type usage."}
