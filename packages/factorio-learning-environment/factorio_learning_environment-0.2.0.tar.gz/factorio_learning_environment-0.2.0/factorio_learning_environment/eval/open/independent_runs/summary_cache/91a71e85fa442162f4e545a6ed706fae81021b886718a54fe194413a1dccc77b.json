{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Iron Ore Mine at position (16.0, 71.0)\nConsists of a burner mining drill at position (16.0, 71.0), a wooden chest at position (15.5, 69.5), a burner inserter at position (14.5, 69.5), another burner inserter at position (16.5, 69.5), a stone furnace at position (16.0, 65.0), a burner inserter at position (16.5, 63.5) that inputs into the furnace, a belt group that connects the burner mining drill to the furnace, a wooden chest at position (18.5, 65.5), and a burner inserter at position (17.5, 65.5) that inputs into the wooden chest.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n### Errors when using incorrect Prototype objects\n- Ensure that the correct Prototype object is used when placing entities. For example, using `Prototype.WoodenChest` instead of `Prototype(\"wooden-chest\")` can cause a ValueError.\n\n### Errors when passing incorrect argument types\n- Ensure that the correct argument types are passed to functions. For example, the second argument to `place_entity` must be a Position object or a dictionary with 'x' and 'y' keys, and the third argument must be a Direction object.\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied positions\n- Ensure that the target position is not occupied by another entity before attempting to place an entity.\n\n### Errors when connecting entities with transport belts\n- Transport belts cannot be connected directly from or to a Prototype.WoodenChest object. You need to add an inserter that takes items from or inputs items into Prototype.WoodenChest and use the inserter as a source or target entity.\n\n### Errors when the target position is too far away\n- Ensure that you are close enough to the target position before attempting to place an entity.\n\n### Errors due to undefined variables\n- Ensure that variables are defined before using them.\n\n### Errors when getting non-existent entities\n- Ensure that the entity exists at the specified position before attempting to get it.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into a full inserter\n- Check if the inserter's inventory is full before attempting to insert items into it.\n\n## NAMESPACE\nNo utility functions have been defined by the agent.\n\nImportant variables:\n- `drill`: BurnerMiningDrill entity at position (16.0, 71.0)\n- `chest`: WoodenChest entity at position (15.5, 69.5)\n- `inserter`: BurnerInserter entity at position (14.5, 69.5)\n- `furnace`: StoneFurnace entity at position (16.0, 65.0)\n- `inserter`: BurnerInserter entity at position (16.5, 63.5)\n- `chest_inserter`: BurnerInserter entity at position (16.5, 69.5)\n- `coal_chest`: WoodenChest entity at position (18.5, 65.5)\n- `new_inserter`: BurnerInserter entity at position (17.5, 65.5)"}
