{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Ore Mine at position(16.0, 71.0)\nConsists of \n- Burner mining drill (position: 16.0, 71.0)\n- Transport belt (position: 16.5, 72.5) to receive iron ore from drill\n- Burner inserter (position: 15.5, 72.5) to take iron ore from belt\n- Burner inserter (position: 17.5, 72.5) to transfer iron ore from belt to furnace\n- Wooden chest (position: 14.5, 73.5) to collect items from belt\n- Burner inserter (position: 18.5, 72.5) to transfer iron ore to furnace\n\n#### Iron Plate Smelter at position(18.0, 75.0)\nConsists of \n- Stone furnace (position: 18.0, 75.0) to smelt iron ore\n- Burner inserter (position: 18.5, 72.5) to transfer iron ore to furnace\n- Wooden chest (position: 20.5, 73.5) to collect iron plates\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n* Errors when extracting items from entities:\n  - Ensure that the entity contains the items you are trying to extract.\n* Errors when extracting items from transport belts:\n  - Ensure that the transport belt is not empty and is not blocked.\n* Errors when placing entities too far away:\n  - Make sure to move to the target position before attempting to place an entity.\n* Errors when connecting entities directly:\n  - Ensure that you are using the correct entities as source and target. For example, you cannot connect a chest directly to a transport belt; use an inserter instead.\n* Errors when connecting to an occupied position:\n  - Ensure that the target position is not occupied by another entity before attempting to connect to it.\n* Errors when placing entities with incorrect spacing or direction:\n  - Ensure that the spacing and direction used for placing entities are correct and do not result in overlapping entities.\n* Errors due to undefined variables:\n  - Ensure that all variables used in the code are defined before they are used.\n* Errors when rotating entities with incorrect arguments:\n  - Ensure that the correct arguments are used when rotating entities. For example, use the correct keyword argument for the direction.\n* Errors when attempting to place entities at occupied positions:\n  - Ensure that the target position is clear of entities before attempting to place an entity.\n* Errors when inserters are waiting for source items or have blocked outputs:\n  - Ensure that the inserter's pickup and drop positions are correctly set and not blocked.\n* Errors due to inspecting inventory of entities that do not have an inventory:\n  - Ensure that the entity has an inventory before attempting to inspect it, as seen in step 49 where 'transport-belt' was inspected.\n* Errors due to using undefined names:\n  - Ensure that all names used in the code are defined before they are used, as seen in step 62 where 'up' was used.\n* Errors when inserting items into a full inventory:\n  - Ensure that the target inventory is not full before attempting to insert items, as seen in step 71 and step 57 where attempting to insert coal into a full furnace and drill inventory resulted in an error.\n* Errors when placing entities next to an occupied position:\n  - Ensure that the target position is not occupied by another entity before attempting to place an entity next to it, as seen in steps 84, 85, and 86.\n* Errors when output is blocked by items on the ground:\n  - Ensure that there is a sink entity in place to accept the output, as seen in step 95 where the inserter at position (15.5, 72.5) was waiting for space in destination.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\nNo utility functions have been defined by the agent.\n\nImportant variables:\n- `drill`: Burner mining drill entity (type not specified)\n- `chest`: Wooden chest entity (type not specified)\n- `inserter`: Burner inserter entity (type not specified)\n- `furnace`: Stone furnace entity (type not specified)\n- `belt`: Transport belt entity (type not specified)\n- `belt_inserter`: Burner inserter entity (type not specified)\n- `chest_inserter`: Burner inserter entity (type not specified)"}
