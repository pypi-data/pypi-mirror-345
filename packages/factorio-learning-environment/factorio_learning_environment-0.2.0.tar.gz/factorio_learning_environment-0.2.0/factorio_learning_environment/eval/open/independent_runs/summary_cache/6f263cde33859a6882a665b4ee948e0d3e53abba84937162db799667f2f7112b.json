{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=17.5, y=20.5), currently not connected, with warnings of \"no input liquid\" and \"no fluid present in connections\". It is connected to:\n  - Pipe-to-ground at position (x=16.5, y=17.5)\n  - Pipe at position (x=17.5, y=17.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=1.5, y=23.0), currently out of fuel, connected to:\n  - Multiple pipes forming a network, including positions such as (x=-0.5, y=21.5) and (x=3.5, y=21.5)\n  - Steam output point at position (x=1.5, y=21.5)\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5), working status, connected to:\n  - Pipe at position (x=-9.5, y=23.5)\n  - Pipe at position (x=-8.5, y=23.5)\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- PipeGroup with fluid system 69548 at position (x=3.5, y=17.5), status empty, includes pipes from (x=3.5, y=17.5) to (x=10.5, y=21.5).\n- PipeGroup with fluid system 69559 at position (x=-9.5, y=23.5), status full output, includes pipes from (x=-9.5, y=23.5) to (x=-0.5, y=23.5).\n\n### Electricity Network\n- ElectricityGroup with id 186079, includes poles at positions such as (x=27.5, y=26.5), (x=-2.5, y=17.5), and (x=1.5, y=14.5), with voltage 0.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Steam Engine Connection\n- Ensure that the steam engine is connected to a valid fluid source. Check all connection points and ensure pipes are properly connected to the boiler and offshore pump.\n\n### Boiler Out of Fuel\n- Regularly check the fuel levels in the boiler and refuel as necessary to maintain operation.\n\n### Offshore Pump Connection\n- Verify that the offshore pump is correctly connected to the pipe network to ensure water flow into the system.\n\n### Electricity Network Voltage\n- Ensure that all electricity poles are properly connected to active power sources to maintain voltage in the network."}
