{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) fueled with coal, extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) storing extracted iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-14.5, -46.5) transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing Facility at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) fueled with coal, extracting coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -80.5) storing extracted coal.\n- Stone Furnace at position (43.0, -82.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (43.5, -80.5) transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when attempting to insert items without sufficient inventory\n- Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. This will prevent errors related to insufficient inventory.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placement. This will prevent errors related to space occupation.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items. This will prevent errors related to distance constraints."}
