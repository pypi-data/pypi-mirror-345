{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnaces**:\n  - Stone furnace at position (-15.0, -48.0)\n  - Stone furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0)\n  - Stone furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0)\n- **Chests**:\n  - Iron chest at position (-5.5, -50.5) storing iron plates\n  - Multiple wooden chests at positions storing iron plates and iron ore\n- **Burner Mining Drill**:\n  - Positioned at (4.0, -60.0), connected to a wooden chest at (4.5, -58.5) for iron ore collection\n\n### Iron Ore Collection\n- **Burner Mining Drill**:\n  - Positioned at (4.0, -60.0), fueled with coal, extracting iron ore into a wooden chest at (4.5, -58.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Full Chest Warnings\n- Ensure to regularly empty chests to prevent them from becoming full and halting production. The chest at position (4.5, -58.5) is full, which stops the mining drill from continuing its operation.\n\n### No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Ensure that furnaces have a continuous supply of raw materials to maintain production. Furnaces at positions (-15.0, -48.0), (-13.0, -48.0), and (-11.0, -48.0) are experiencing a lack of ingredients to smelt.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined in the provided logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `iron_ore_count: int` - Total iron ore in inventory: 88\n- `iron_plate_count: int` - Total iron plates in inventory: 4446\n- `iron_gear_wheel_count: int` - Total iron gear wheels in inventory: 4\n- `wood_count: int` - Total wood in inventory: 10"}
