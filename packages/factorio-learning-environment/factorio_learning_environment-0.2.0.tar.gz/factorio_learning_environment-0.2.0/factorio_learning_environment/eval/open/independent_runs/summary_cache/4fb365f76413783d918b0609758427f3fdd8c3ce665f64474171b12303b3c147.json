{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Furnace Group at positions (0, 0) and (2, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace (position 0.0, 0.0) with status: EntityStatus.NO_INGREDIENTS, Fuel: {'coal': 9}\n- Stone Furnace (position 2.0, 0.0) with status: EntityStatus.NO_INGREDIENTS, Fuel: {'coal': 8}\n- Stone Furnace (position 2.0, 2.0) with status: EntityStatus.NO_INGREDIENTS, Fuel: {'coal': 20}\n\n### Wooden Chest at position (5.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entity:\n- Wooden Chest with inventory: {'iron-plate': 160}\n\n### Lab at position (unknown)\nConsists of the following entity:\n- Lab with status: EntityStatus.NO_POWER, research: automation\n\n### Electricity Group\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Electricity Group with poles at positions: (6.5, 0.5), (15.5, 10.5), (13.5, 10.5), (12.5, 9.5), (20.5, 10.5), (13.5, 12.5), (15.5, 15.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items into full inventories\n- Ensure that the target entity has enough space in its inventory before attempting to insert items. For example, the stone furnace at position (2, 0) was full when attempting to insert iron plates.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors related to power supply\n- Ensure that the lab and other structures requiring power are connected to a power source to avoid status updates indicating no power."}
