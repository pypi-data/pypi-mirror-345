{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Furnace at position (1.0, 1.0)\nConsists of:\n- Furnace (position 1.0, 1.0) with coal as fuel and iron ore as input.\n\n### Wooden chest at position (3.5, 1.5)\nConsists of:\n- Wooden chest (position 3.5, 1.5) with an inventory containing 50 iron plates.\n\n### Wooden chest at position (3.5, 3.5)\nConsists of:\n- Wooden chest (position 3.5, 3.5) with an inventory containing 50 iron plates.\n\n### Wooden chest at position (3.5, 5.5)\nConsists of:\n- Wooden chest (position 3.5, 5.5) with an empty inventory.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when crafting items due to missing resources\n- Ensure you gather enough raw materials before attempting to craft items. For example, wood is required to craft a wooden chest.\n\n### Errors when placing entities too far away\n- Move closer to the target position before placing an entity. The maximum distance for placing entities is 10 tiles.\n\n### Errors when trying to research technologies without enough science packs\n- Ensure you have enough Automation Science Packs to research technologies. Gather more science packs if necessary.\n\n### Errors with furnace due to lack of ingredients\n- Check the inventory of the furnace and ensure you have the necessary ingredients to smelt. If the furnace shows \"no ingredients to smelt,\" you need to supply it with the required materials."}
