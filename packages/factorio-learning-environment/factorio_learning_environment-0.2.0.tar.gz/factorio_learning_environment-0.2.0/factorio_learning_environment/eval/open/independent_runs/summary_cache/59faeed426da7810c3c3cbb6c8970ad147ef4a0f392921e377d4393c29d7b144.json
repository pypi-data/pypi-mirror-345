{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) extracting iron ore, connected to:\n  - **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) and (x=-15.5, y=-48.5) for storing iron ore.\n- **Stone Furnace 1** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates. It receives iron ore from:\n  - **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace 2** at position (x=-10.0, y=-48.0) for additional smelting of iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5) transferring iron ore from the chest to another location.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-46.5) used for storing iron ore before further processing.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage\nConsists of:\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-6.5, y=-48.5) storing iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-8.5, y=-47.5) transferring iron plates from the furnace to the storage chest.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the inserter has access to source items by checking the inventory of the source entity. Refuel the inserter if necessary and ensure the source entity is producing or has items available for transfer.\n\n### Errors with LuaItemStack Insertion\n- When inserting items into a furnace or chest, ensure that there is enough space in the destination inventory. Verify that the item stack is not full and the entity is ready to accept more items.\n\n### UnboundLocalError: Variable Access\n- Ensure that all variables are properly initialized and assigned before use. Check for any typos or logical errors in the code where the variable is being accessed.\n\n### No Iron Ore Available for Transfer\n- Regularly check the inventory levels of the source entity to ensure there is sufficient iron ore available for transfer. Automate the supply chain to maintain a steady flow of resources.\n\n### Out of Fuel Warnings\n- Regularly refuel all burner entities to prevent them from stopping operations. Consider using a more efficient fuel source or automating the refueling process to maintain continuous operation."}
