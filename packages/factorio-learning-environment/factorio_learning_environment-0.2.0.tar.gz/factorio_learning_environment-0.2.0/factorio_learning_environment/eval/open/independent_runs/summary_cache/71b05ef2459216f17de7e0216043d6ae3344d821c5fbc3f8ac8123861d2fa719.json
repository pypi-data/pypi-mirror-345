{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-4.5, 23.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Boiler (position -4.5, 23.0)\n- Steam engine (position -0.5, -9.5)\n- Small electric poles (positions: 1.5, -11.5; -2.5, -9.5; -2.5, -8.5; 1.5, -9.5; 1.5, -7.5)\n\n### Copper plate factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace (position 0.0, 0.0)\n- Furnace (position 5.0, 5.0)\n- Small electric poles (positions: -4.5, 21.5; -5.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe groups (multiple positions)\n\n### Lab at position (unknown)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab (position unknown)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to power connections\n- Ensure that all power-consuming entities (like boilers and steam engines) are connected to a power network. Check the proximity of small electric poles to these entities.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity on a tile before attempting to place it.\n\n### Errors related to fluid connections\n- Verify that all fluid-related entities (like boilers) have the necessary input fluids and connections established. Check for any missing pipes or connections that may lead to empty fluid systems."}
