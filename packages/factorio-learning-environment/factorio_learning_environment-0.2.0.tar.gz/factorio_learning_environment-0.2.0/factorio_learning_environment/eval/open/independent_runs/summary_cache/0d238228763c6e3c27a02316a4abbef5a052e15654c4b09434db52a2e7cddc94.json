{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and outputs to a wooden chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates, but currently not receiving iron ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Alignment and Functionality\n- Ensure the inserter is correctly aligned and positioned to pick up items from the source and drop them into the target. Misalignment can cause the inserter to not function as intended.\n\n### Errors with Fuel Management\n- Always check inventory levels before attempting to refuel entities. The error \"Could not insert: No coal to insert from your inventory\" indicates a lack of coal in the inventory. Ensure sufficient coal is available before attempting to refuel.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Operation\n- Verify that the furnace is receiving the necessary ingredients to operate. The message \"Furnace is not receiving iron ore\" suggests that the inserter setup or alignment may be incorrect, preventing iron ore from being transferred to the furnace. Adjust the inserter or check for obstructions.\n\n### General Inventory Management\n- Regularly monitor inventory levels to ensure there are enough resources for operations, such as coal for fueling and iron ore for smelting."}
