This structure is employed to increase the iron plate inventory needed for subsequent Lab crafting attempts.\n\n### Copper Plate Smelter at Position(x=-27.0, y=-60.0)\nConsists of a furnace used to process copper ore and coal into copper plates. Its role is to augment the copper plate resources required for crafting copper\u2010cable and other intermediate items for Lab production.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 get_entities API misuse \u2013 Avoid providing unsupported keyword arguments (such as \u201cradius\u201d) or an incorrect number of positional arguments. Verify the API signature before invoking the function.\n\u2022 NoneType iteration errors \u2013 Ensure that the return value from get_entities is validated (e.g. replacing None with an empty list) before attempting to iterate over it.\n\u2022 Lab placement issues \u2013 Confirm that a Lab exists in inventory prior to attempting placement at a target location.\n\u2022 Lab crafting failures \u2013 Check that all required sub-ingredients (for example, iron-gear-wheels and electronic circuits) are available and that prerequisite production processes (such as sufficient smelting operations for iron and copper plates) have been completed before initiating Lab crafting."}
