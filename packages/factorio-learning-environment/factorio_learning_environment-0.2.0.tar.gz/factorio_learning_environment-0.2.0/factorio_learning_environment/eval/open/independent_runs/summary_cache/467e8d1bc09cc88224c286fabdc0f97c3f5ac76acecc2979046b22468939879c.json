{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position (42.0, -83.0)\nConsists of a burner mining drill that is currently out of fuel.\n\n### Wooden Chest at position (42.5, -81.5)\nConsists of a wooden chest that is currently empty.\n\n### Burner Inserter at position (42.5, -80.5)\nConsists of a burner inserter that is waiting for source items and has 14 coal in its inventory.\n\n### Burner Inserter at position (43.5, -81.5)\nConsists of a burner inserter that is waiting for source items and has 1 coal in its inventory.\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of a burner mining drill that is currently out of fuel.\n\n### Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of a wooden chest that is currently empty.\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of a stone furnace that is out of fuel and has 5 iron ore and 100 iron plates in its inventory.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to lack of fuel\n- Ensure that all burner mining drills and furnaces have sufficient fuel to operate. Check fuel levels regularly and replenish as needed.\n\n### Errors when attempting to extract from an empty chest\n- Verify that the wooden chest contains the required items before attempting to extract. If the chest is empty, consider moving to a different location or replenishing the chest.\n\n### Errors with inserters waiting for source items\n- Make sure that the inserters have a valid source to draw from. If they are waiting for items, check the inventory of the connected entities to ensure they contain the necessary materials.\n\n### Repeated errors\n- The same errors regarding no iron ore found in the wooden chest, burner mining drills being out of fuel, and inserters waiting for source items have occurred multiple times. Address these issues systematically to prevent recurrence.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the current execution steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `wood`: int\n- `iron-ore`: int\n- `iron-plate`: int\n- `iron-gear-wheel`: int\n- `coal`: int"}
