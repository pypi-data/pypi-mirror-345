
Hi Mike,

Thank you so much for the income tax preparation. I have a few questions after reviewing the return:

- Roth conversion was made as an in-plan conversion from a 401k to a Roth-401k. Do we still need form 8606?
- Out of curiosity, Roth conversion was for $240,000.00 with 0.79 deamed coming from a designated Roth contribution. Why was the $1 been added as a taxable item in statement 4? This is a minor point (and therefore can stay as is). Just curiosity as I said.
- How do I pay your fees?

Questions for the future:
- You mentioned that the 2023 filing has to be corrected. Is it to my benefit or against it?
- I am planning to stop my consulting job at the end of May. Would it still be worth creating a Corporation for 5 months?
- I will probably move to FL later this year (I was in Atlanta for my daughter - she will likely move to CA shortly).  I am planning to perform another large Roth conversion this year (preventing large RMDs). I will need your advice as to when to proceed.


I submitted signed form 8879 through your portal.

Thanks again,

Martin
