{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-10.5, 25.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore pump at position(-10.5, 25.5)\n- Boiler at position(-13.5, 20.0)\n- Steam engine at position(-10.5, 22.5)\n- Small electric poles at positions (-15.5, 19.5), (-15.5, 18.5), (-15.5, 21.5)\n\n### Lab at position(-17.5, 23.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab at position(-17.5, 23.5) \n\n### Assembling machine at position(-21.5, 25.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine at position(-21.5, 25.5)\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(-18.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position x1) and a furnace at position(y1)\n- Burner mining drill (position x2) and a furnace at position(y2)\n- Burner mining drill (position x3) and a furnace at position(y3)\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position x1) and a furnace at position(y1)\n- Assembling machine at position(z1) and inserter at position(a) that puts into assembling machine\n- Beltgroup (position) that connects the furnace at position y1 to assembling machine at position(z1)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to lab power\n- Ensure that the lab is connected to a power source that is functioning properly. Check the connections to electric poles and ensure they are powered.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it. \n\n### Errors related to boiler fuel\n- Ensure the boiler has fuel to operate. Check the inventory for available fuel sources and add them to the boiler."}
