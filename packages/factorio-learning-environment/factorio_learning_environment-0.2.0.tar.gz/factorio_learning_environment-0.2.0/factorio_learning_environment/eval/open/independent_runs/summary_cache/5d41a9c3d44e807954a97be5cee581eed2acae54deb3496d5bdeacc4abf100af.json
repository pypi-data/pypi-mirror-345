The correct attribute name is 'LogisticsSciencePack'.\n\n### Errors when using undefined variables\n- Ensure that variables are defined before they are used. \n- In this case, 'drill' and 'entity' are not defined when trying to access or use them.\n\n### Errors when connecting entities with pipes\n- Ensure that the source and target entities are adjacent and that there are no obstacles blocking the connection.\n- In this case, there was an error connecting offshore pump at (-9.5, -0.5) to boiler at (-8.0, -0.5).\n\n### Errors when placing entities next to other entities\n- Ensure that the target position is not occupied by another entity or water.\n- Consider increasing the spacing, changing the direction, or changing the reference position.\n- In this case, there were errors placing boiler next to offshore pump at (-9.5, -0.5) and (-9.5, 1.5).\n\n### Errors when placing entities at a specific position\n- Ensure that the target position is not occupied by another entity.\n- In this case, there was an error placing boiler at (-9.0, 0.0) and wooden chest at (-46.5, 73.5) because the target position is too far away.\n\n### Errors when crafting items without required ingredients\n- Ensure that the required ingredients are available in the inventory before crafting.\n- In this case, there was an error crafting 'automation-science-pack' because 'copper-plate' was not available.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into entities\n- Ensure that the item to be inserted is available in the inventory and that the entity has available space.\n- In this case, there were errors inserting 'automation-science-pack', 'copper-ore', and 'coal' into entities because they were not available in the inventory or the entity had no available space.\n\n## NAMESPACE\nNo utility functions have been defined by the agent."}
