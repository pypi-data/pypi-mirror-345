{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (22.5, -7.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (22.5, -7.5)\n- Boiler at Position (20.5, -4.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (19.5, -1.5)\n- Connected Pipe Network spanning from (18.5, -3.5) to (24.5, -5.5)\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (2.0, 0.0)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0)\n\n### Inserter and Storage System\nConsists of:\n- Inserter at Position (-3.5, 1.5)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (-3.5, 0.5)\n- Small Electric Poles at Positions (-3.5, 2.5) and (-2.5, 2.5)\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- PipeGroup at Position (19.5, -12.5) with status EMPTY\n- PipeGroup at Position (5.5, -8.5) with status FULL_OUTPUT containing water\n- PipeGroup at Position (18.5, -3.5) with status FULL_OUTPUT containing water\n\n### Electricity Networks\n- ElectricityGroup with ID 3066, spanning poles from (10.5, -10.5) to (24.5, -7.5) with voltage 66\n- ElectricityGroup with ID 3074, spanning poles from (-5.5, 1.5) to (2.5, 3.5) with voltage 0\n\n### Laboratory\n- Lab at Position (not specified), missing science packs, researching electronics\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Entities without Required Items\n- Ensure you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to connect entities. For example, connecting a Small Electric Pole requires having it in your inventory.\n\n### Errors due to Inserter Not Receiving Power\n- Make sure that inserters are connected to a powered electric pole to avoid the \"not receiving electricity\" status.\n\n### Errors with Steam Engine Not Receiving Input Liquid\n- Verify that the steam engine is properly connected to a boiler and that the boiler has a sufficient supply of water and fuel to generate steam.\n\n### Errors with Boiler Out of Fuel\n- Regularly check and refuel boilers to ensure they have enough fuel to operate and produce steam."}
