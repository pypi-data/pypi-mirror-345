{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Mining and Smelting Setup at (-21.0, -73.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (position -21.0, -73.0)\n- Iron chest for ore collection (position -21.5, -74.5)\n- Burner inserter (position -20.5, -74.5)\n- Stone furnace for smelting (position -19.0, -74.0)\n\n### Iron Mining Setup at (-2.0, -76.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (position -2.0, -76.0)\n- Iron chest for ore collection (position -1.5, -74.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nComplex setup consisting of:\n- Iron chest for plate storage (position 1.5, -74.5)\n- Burner inserter (position 0.5, -74.5)\n- Additional iron chest (position 3.5, -75.5)\n- Two stone furnaces (positions 3.0, -73.0 and 5.0, -73.0)\n- Multiple burner inserters (positions 3.5, -74.5 and 5.5, -74.5)\n- Output iron chest (position 7.5, -72.5)\n- Complex belt system connecting various components:\n  - Vertical belt group from (1.5, -74.5) to (1.5, -72.5)\n  - Horizontal belt group from (0.5, -70.5) to (7.5, -69.5)\n  - Belt group around (-0.5, -71.5) to (1.5, -71.5)\n  - Long vertical belt group from (0.5, -71.5) to (8.5, -74.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Pickup Errors\n- Before attempting to pick up an entity, verify that the entity exists at the specified position\n- Double check coordinates when trying to pick up entities\n\n### Resource Management Issues\n- Monitor chest capacity: The iron ore mining drill's chest is getting full, implement a system to empty chests regularly\n- Ensure mining drills have sufficient fuel to operate (copper mining drill is out of fuel)\n\n### Production Line Efficiency\n- Multiple furnaces show \"no ingredients to smelt\" warning - ensure proper material flow through the production line\n- Some inserters are waiting for source items - verify the logistics chain is properly connected and supplied"}
