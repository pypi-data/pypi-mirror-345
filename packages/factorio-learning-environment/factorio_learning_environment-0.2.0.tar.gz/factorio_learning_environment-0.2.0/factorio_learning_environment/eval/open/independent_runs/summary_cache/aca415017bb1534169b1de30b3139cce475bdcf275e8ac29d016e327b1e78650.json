Consider adjusting the spacing or changing the direction to avoid collisions with existing entities like transport belts.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient spacing for inserter placement\n- When placing inserters, ensure there is adequate spacing between the inserter and adjacent entities. Adjust the reference position or increase the spacing to prevent placement errors.\n\n### Errors due to inserter placement direction\n- Verify the direction of inserter placement to ensure it aligns with the intended workflow. Adjust the direction if necessary to avoid conflicts with existing structures.\n\n### Errors due to lack of fuel in mining drills\n- Regularly check and refuel mining drills to prevent them from running out of fuel, which halts resource extraction."}
