If the belt is not meant to hold items, avoid using the inspect_inventory function on it.\n\n### Errors when Using Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Verify that the inserters have access to items they need to pick up. Ensure that the source entity is correctly positioned and contains the necessary items for the inserter to function."}
