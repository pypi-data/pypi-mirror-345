{"content": "I'll create a comprehensive report based on the execution logs and entity data provided.\n\n# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining & Transport System at (-15, -50)\n- Burner mining drill mining iron ore (position -15, -50)\n- Wooden chest for temporary storage (position -13.5, -50.5)\n- Burner inserter moving items from drill to chest (position -14.5, -51.5)\n- Burner inserter moving items from chest to belt (position -12.5, -50.5)\n\n### Main Belt Transport Network\nMultiple belt groups forming a large transport network:\n- Main line running from (-4.5, -54.5) to (44.5, -81.5)\n- Contains 105 belts carrying iron ore and coal\n- Multiple smaller belt groups connecting various sections\n- Several parallel belt lines for redundancy\n\n### Iron Plate Production Area (46, -80)\n- Stone furnace for smelting (position 46, -80)\n- Multiple burner inserters for fuel and material handling:\n  - Inserter at (46.5, -81.5) for input\n  - Inserter at (47.5, -81.5) for fuel\n- Storage chest containing iron plates (position 49.5, -79.5)\n\n### Secondary Smelting Station (51, -80)\n- Stone furnace (position 51, -80)\n- Multiple burner inserters for automation:\n  - Inserters at (51.5, -81.5) and (52.5, -82.5)\n- Currently idle due to no ingredients\n\n### Storage System\nMultiple wooden chests for various materials:\n- Iron ore storage (position -6.5, -52.5)\n- Transport belt storage (position -8.5, -52.5)\n- Iron plate storage (position 49.5, -79.5)\n- Coal storage (position 39.5, -83.5)\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Belt Connection Issues\n- Ensure proper belt flow direction when connecting belt segments\n- Verify that belt segments are properly aligned before attempting to connect them\n- Clear blocked belts before attempting to place new ones in the same position\n\n### Entity Placement Errors\n- Check for available space before placing new entities\n- Ensure required items are in inventory before attempting to place specialized belts (like underground belts)\n- Verify entity orientation matches intended flow direction\n\n### Resource Management\n- Keep fuel levels maintained in burner devices to prevent \"NO_FUEL\" status\n- Monitor storage chest capacity to prevent overflow\n- Ensure proper spacing between entities to allow for inserter operation\n\n### Belt Flow Optimization\n- Avoid creating disconnected belt segments\n- Maintain consistent flow direction in belt networks\n- Clear blocked belts before attempting modifications\n\n# NAMESPACE\n\n### Important Variables\n- `belt_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks items on transport belts\n- `entity_status`: EntityStatus - Enum tracking various entity states\n- `direction`: Direction - Enum for entity orientations\n\n### Entity States\n- `EntityStatus.WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION`\n- `EntityStatus.WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS`\n- `EntityStatus.NO_FUEL`\n- `EntityStatus.NO_INGREDIENTS`\n- `EntityStatus.WORKING`\n- `EntityStatus.EMPTY`\n- `EntityStatus.NORMAL`"}
