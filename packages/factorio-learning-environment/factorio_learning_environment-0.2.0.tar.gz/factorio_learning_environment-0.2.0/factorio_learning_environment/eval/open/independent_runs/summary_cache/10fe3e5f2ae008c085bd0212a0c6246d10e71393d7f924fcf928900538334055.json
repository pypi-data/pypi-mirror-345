{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining Station at (-14.0, -15.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (24.0, -15.0)\n- Wooden chest at (23.5, -16.5) for coal storage\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Station at (-14.0, 23.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-14.0, 23.0)\n- Wooden chest at (-14.5, 21.5) for iron ore storage\n\n### Iron Smelting Area at (-10.0, 20.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace at (-11.0, 20.0)\n- Stone furnace at (-9.0, 20.0)\n\n### Copper Processing Station at (22.0, 20.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (20.0, 20.0)\n- Wooden chest at (20.5, 21.5) for copper ore storage\n- Stone furnace at (24.0, 20.0)\n- Wooden chest at (24.5, 17.5) for copper plate storage\n- Burner inserter at (21.5, 21.5) moving items from mining drill to chest\n- Burner inserter at (22.5, 20.5) moving items to furnace\n- Burner inserter at (24.5, 18.5) moving processed items to storage\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with belt connections\n- Cannot connect transport belts directly from chests - must use inserters as intermediaries\n- Ensure belt paths are valid and can be normalized before attempting to create connections\n- When creating belt connections, verify that the start and end positions are reachable and form a valid path\n\n### Entity placement coordination\n- When setting up production lines, plan the layout carefully to ensure entities can properly connect to each other\n- Consider the direction and positioning of inserters relative to other entities they need to interact with\n\n### Resource management\n- Multiple mining drills are out of fuel - implement a fuel management system\n- Ensure mining drills and other burner entities are regularly supplied with coal"}
