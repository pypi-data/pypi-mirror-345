{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=42.0, y=-83.0)\n  - Status: Waiting for space in destination\n  - Warnings: Output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Neighbours: Transport belt at position (x=43.5, y=-82.5) and Burner Inserter at position (x=42.5, y=-81.5)\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=42.5, y=-81.5)\n  - Status: Waiting for source items\n  - Warnings: Chest is full\n  - Neighbours: Burner Mining Drill at position (x=42.0, y=-83.0) and Transport belt at positions (x=43.5, y=-82.5) and (x=43.5, y=-80.5)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-15.0, y=-49.0)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Furnace Source: Iron ore\n  - Furnace Result: Iron plate\n\n### Transport Belt System\n- **Belt Group**:\n  - Inputs: Belt from (x=42.5, y=-82.5) to (x=44.5, y=-82.5), direction RIGHT\n  - Outputs: Belt from (x=43.5, y=-80.5) to (x=42.5, y=-79.5), direction LEFT\n  - Status: Empty\n  - Belts: 7 belts in total\n  - Verified transport belts at positions (x=43.5, y=-82.5) and (x=43.5, y=-80.5) are aligned correctly\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Ensure that the target tile is unoccupied before attempting to place entities such as Wooden Chests and Burner Inserters. This will prevent placement errors like \"Cannot place Wooden Chest\" or \"Cannot place Burner Inserter\".\n\n### Errors due to blocked outputs\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity or storage available to accept outputs from production entities like Burner Mining Drills to avoid warnings such as \"Output blocked by item on the ground.\"\n\n### Errors due to full chests\n- Regularly check and clear storage entities like chests to prevent them from becoming full, which can lead to warnings like \"chest is full\" and halt production processes."}
