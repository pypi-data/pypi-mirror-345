{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Coal mining operation at position(x=41, y=-82)\nConsists of a burner mining drill (position x=41, y=-82) and two chests (positions x=40.5, y=-83.5 and x=41.5, y=-83.5) for storing coal.\n\n### Coal transportation system\nConsists of a burner inserter (position x=39.5, y=-81.5) that connects the coal mining operation to a drop position.\n\n### Furnace at position(x=0, y=0)\nConsists of a stone furnace (position x=0, y=0) with a full fuel source.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n* **Errors when inserting coal into the burner mining drill**: Make sure the drill's inventory is not full before attempting to insert coal.\n* **Errors when extracting coal from the coal chest**: Ensure that the chest is not empty and that the agent has the necessary permissions to extract coal.\n* **Errors when the furnace has no ingredients to smelt**: Provide the furnace with the necessary ingredients to smelt.\n* **Errors when the furnace fuel source is full**: Ensure that the furnace's fuel source is not full before attempting to add more fuel.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n* **Utility functions**:\n\t+ `extract_item`: Extracts items from a chest. Failure modes: chest is empty, agent does not have permission to extract. Success modes: items are extracted successfully.\n\t+ `insert_item`: Inserts items into a drill or furnace. Failure modes: drill or furnace inventory is full, agent does not have permission to insert. Success modes: items are inserted successfully.\n* **Important variables**:\n\t+ `coal_chest`: The chest that stores coal. Type: Chest.\n\t+ `drill`: The burner mining drill that extracts coal. Type: BurnerMiningDrill.\n\t+ `furnace`: The stone furnace that smelts coal. Type: Furnace.\n\t+ `inserter`: The burner inserter that transports coal. Type: BurnerInserter."}
