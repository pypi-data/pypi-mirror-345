Check the supply chain to ensure that raw materials are being delivered to the furnaces.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Verify that the inserters have access to source items. Ensure that the source containers or belts are supplying the necessary items to the inserters.\n\n### Errors with Empty Inventory in Chests\n- Regularly check the inventory of chests to ensure they are being filled as expected. If a chest is empty, trace back through the supply chain to identify any blockages or missing connections."}
