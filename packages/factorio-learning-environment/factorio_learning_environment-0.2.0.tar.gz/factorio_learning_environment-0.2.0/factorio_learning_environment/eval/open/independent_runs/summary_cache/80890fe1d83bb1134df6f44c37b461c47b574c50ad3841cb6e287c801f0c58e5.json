{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, -60.0) with a drop position at (4.5, -58.5). It is currently working but has a warning that the chest at the drop position is full.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (5.5, -60.5), (7.5, -60.5), (6.5, -60.5), (9.5, -60.5), (8.5, -60.5), and (4.5, -58.5). The chest at (4.5, -58.5) contains iron ore.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (-15.0, -48.0), (-13.0, -48.0), and (-11.0, -48.0). These furnaces are used for smelting iron ore into iron plates. They have been intermittently running out of ingredients.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Full Inventory in Mining Drill\n- Ensure to regularly empty the chest at the drop position of the burner mining drill to prevent it from halting operations.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Ingredients in Furnaces\n- Maintain a steady supply of iron ore to the furnaces to avoid them running out of ingredients. Monitor the inventory levels and ensure timely replenishment.\n\n### Errors When Inserting Items with Insufficient Inventory\n- Before attempting to insert items into entities like drills or furnaces, check your inventory to ensure you have the required items. This will prevent errors related to insufficient inventory.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - `insert_item`: Used to insert items into entities. Errors occurred when attempting to insert items without having them in the inventory.\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `drill`: Represents the burner mining drill entity.\n  - `furnace`: Represents the stone furnace entity.\n  - `coal_to_insert`: Quantity of coal to be inserted into entities."}
