In this case, the 'Chest' entity was not defined, leading to a NameError. Verify the correct class or module names and ensure they are imported or defined before use.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Check that the inserter has access to source items. Ensure that the source entities contain items to be moved by the inserter. Adjust the position or supply of source items if necessary."}
