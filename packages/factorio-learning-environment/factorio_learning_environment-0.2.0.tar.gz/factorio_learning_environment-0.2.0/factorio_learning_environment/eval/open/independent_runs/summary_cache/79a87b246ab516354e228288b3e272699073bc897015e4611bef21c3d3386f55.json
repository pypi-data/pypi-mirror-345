The logs indicate attempts to place various entities, but none have been successfully placed on the map.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure that the target tile is clear before attempting to place an entity. Multiple attempts to place entities such as Wooden Chests and Stone Furnaces failed due to occupied or invalid positions.\n- Verify the position is within the valid range and not obstructed by other entities or terrain features before placing.\n\n### Errors with position checks\n- Before attempting to place an entity, confirm that the position is clear for placement. The logs indicate numerous checks where positions were not clear, leading to failed placement attempts.\n\n### General Placement Strategy\n- Plan the layout of your structures to avoid overlapping or invalid placements. This will help in efficiently utilizing space and resources.\n- Consider using a grid system or markers to ensure that entities are placed in valid and intended positions."}
