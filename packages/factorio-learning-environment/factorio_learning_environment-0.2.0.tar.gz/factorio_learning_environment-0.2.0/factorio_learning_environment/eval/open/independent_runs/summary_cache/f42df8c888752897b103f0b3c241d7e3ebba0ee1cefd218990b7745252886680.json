{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Offshore Pump at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\n- Consists of an offshore pump placed in water, currently not connected to any fluid system.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility\n- **Burner Mining Drill and Wooden Chest**: \n  - Burner mining drill at position (-15.0, -76.0) connected to a wooden chest at position (-15.5, -77.5). The chest is full, preventing further mining.\n- **Stone Furnaces**:\n  - Stone furnace at position (-19.0, -73.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n  - Stone furnace at position (9.0, -64.0) with iron plates in inventory.\n  - Stone furnace at position (6.0, -62.0) with iron plates in inventory.\n- **Inserter and Wooden Chest**:\n  - Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) not receiving electricity, connected to a wooden chest at position (6.5, -59.5) containing iron ore and iron plates.\n\n### Pipe Network\n- Multiple pipe groups present, none are currently transporting fluids. Notable positions include:\n  - PipeGroup at position (-35.5, -122.5)\n  - PipeGroup at position (-48.5, -112.5)\n  - PipeGroup at position (-37.5, -111.5)\n  - PipeGroup at position (-42.5, -109.5)\n\n### Electricity Network\n- Electricity group with poles at various positions, currently not supplying power to connected entities.\n\n### Laboratory\n- Lab present with automation science packs but not receiving power.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### AttributeError: 'PipeGroup' object has no attribute 'prototype'\n- Ensure that when interacting with PipeGroup objects, you are using the correct attributes and methods. PipeGroup does not have a 'prototype' attribute, so avoid calling it.\n\n### Warnings and Status Issues\n- **Out of Fuel**: Ensure that all burner mining drills have a sufficient fuel supply to continue operations.\n- **No Ingredients to Smelt**: Provide necessary ingredients to stone furnaces to enable smelting.\n- **Not Receiving Electricity**: Check the electricity network connections to ensure that all entities requiring power are connected and receiving electricity.\n- **Chest Full**: Regularly empty chests that are connected to mining drills to prevent stoppage in resource collection."}
