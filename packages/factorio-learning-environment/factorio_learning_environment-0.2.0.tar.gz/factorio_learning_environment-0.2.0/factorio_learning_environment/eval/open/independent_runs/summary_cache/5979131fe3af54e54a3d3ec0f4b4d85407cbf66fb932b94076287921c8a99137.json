{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) extracting iron ore with a drop position at (x=-14.5, y=-48.5).\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-46.5) storing iron ore, currently holding 35 units.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5) transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace, with a pickup position at (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) and a drop position at (x=-14.5, y=-46.5).\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates, currently holding 2 iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-1.5, y=0.5) transferring iron plates from the furnace, with a pickup position at (x=-2.5, y=0.5) and a drop position at (x=-0.5, y=0.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient resources for operations\n- Ensure that you have sufficient resources in your inventory before attempting to insert items. For example, the error \"Could not insert: No coal to insert from your inventory\" suggests that you should verify your inventory for the required resources before performing such actions.\n\n### Errors due to misaligned inserters\n- Ensure that inserters are correctly positioned to transfer items between entities. Reposition inserters if necessary to ensure proper item flow, as seen with the repositioning of the inserter at (x=-14.5, y=-47.5) to transfer iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n\n### Errors due to lack of ingredients in furnaces\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to process. The furnace at (x=0.0, y=0.0) is not receiving iron ore, indicating a need to check the supply chain feeding into the furnace."}
