{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) fueled with coal, extracting iron ore. It is connected to:\n  - **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-15.5, y=-51.5) storing extracted iron ore.\n  - **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-51.5) transferring iron ore to a transport belt.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) fueled with coal, processing iron ore into iron plates.\n  - **Burner Inserter** at position (x=0.5, y=-1.5) transferring iron plates from the furnace to a transport belt.\n\n### Transport System\n- **BeltGroup** connecting the mining drill and furnace:\n  - Input belt from (x=-13.5, y=-51.5) to (x=-11.5, y=-51.5), direction RIGHT.\n  - Output belt from (x=0.5, y=-3.5) to (x=0.5, y=-1.5), direction DOWN.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Insufficient Inventory Items\n- Ensure that there are enough items in the inventory before attempting to insert them into entities. For instance, attempting to insert coal into a mining drill without having coal in the inventory will result in an error.\n\n### Errors with Full Storage\n- Regularly check and empty storage entities like chests to prevent them from becoming full, which can halt operations. For example, the chest at position (-15.5, -51.5) was full, stopping the mining drill from continuing its operation.\n\n### Errors with Blocked Belts\n- Monitor and clear blockages on belts to ensure smooth operation. The furnace belt was blocked, preventing the inserter from dropping items.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- **insert_item**: Attempts to insert a specified quantity of an item into a target entity. Failure occurs if the item is not available in the inventory.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `mining_drill`: Represents the burner mining drill entity.\n- `inventory`: A dictionary representing the current items and their quantities in the player's inventory."}
