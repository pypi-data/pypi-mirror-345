{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (52.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (52.0, -82.0) working with a wooden chest at position (53.5, -80.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (53.5, -80.5) connected to a burner inserter.\n- Burner Inserter at position (52.5, -79.5) transferring items from the chest at position (53.5, -80.5) to another chest at position (52.5, -78.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -78.5) storing coal.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-12.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-12.0, -51.0) working with a stone furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) and a wooden chest at position (-11.5, -49.5).\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) with a warning of no ingredients to smelt.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-11.5, -49.5) storing iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-11.5, -48.5) waiting for source items to transfer from the chest at position (-11.5, -49.5).\n- Additional burner inserters at positions (-8.5, -48.5) and (-13.5, -46.5) waiting for source items.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source containers have items available for the inserters to pick up. Check for blockages or ensure that the production line is functioning correctly to supply items to the inserters.\n\n### Warnings in Mining and Processing\n- The burner mining drill at (-12.0, -51.0) has a warning indicating that the chest at the drop position is full. Regularly empty the chest at (-11.5, -49.5) to prevent mining interruptions.\n- The stone furnace at (-14.0, -49.0) has a warning of no ingredients to smelt. Ensure that the necessary raw materials are supplied to the furnace for continuous operation.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined by the agent in the provided logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Current inventory items including 'wooden-chest', 'wood', 'coal', 'iron-ore', and 'iron-plate'.\n- `entities_on_map`: List[Entity] - A list of entities on the map with their respective positions and statuses."}
