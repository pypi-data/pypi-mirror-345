{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Offshore pump at position(-11.5, 26.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore pump (position -11.5, 26.5) supplying water.\n- Pipe connections to various pipe groups.\n\n### Steam engine at position(-18.5, 19.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam engine (position -18.5, 19.5) which is currently not connected to a power network.\n- Boiler (position -13.5, 20.0) which is currently not connected due to placement issues.\n- Pipe connections to various pipe groups.\n\n### Boiler at position(-13.5, 20.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Boiler (position -13.5, 20.0) which has failed to connect to the steam engine.\n\n### Electricity group\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Small electric poles at positions (-16.5, 18.5), (-16.5, 19.5), (-16.5, 20.5), (-16.5, 21.5), (-19.5, 22.5).\n\n### Pipe groups\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Multiple pipe groups facilitating fluid transport between the offshore pump and the steam engine.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting boiler to steam engine\n- Ensure that there are no obstacles in the way of the boiler and steam engine connection points before attempting to connect them.\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Confirm that the target location is clear of other entities before placing a new entity. In this case, the boiler could not be placed due to an obstruction.\n\n### Errors when using pipes\n- Verify that the pipes are correctly positioned and that there are no gaps in the connections to ensure fluid transport is functional.\n\n### Errors with power connections\n- Check that all power connections are established properly to avoid entities being reported as not receiving power."}
