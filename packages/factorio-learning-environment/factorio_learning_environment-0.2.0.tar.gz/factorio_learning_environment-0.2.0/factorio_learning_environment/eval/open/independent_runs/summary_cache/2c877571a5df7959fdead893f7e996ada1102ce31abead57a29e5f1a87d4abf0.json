{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Copper plate mine at position(x=41.0, y=-82.0)\nConsists of following entities\n-  Burner mining drill (position x=41.0, y=-82.0) and a furnace at position(x=41.0, y=-80.0)\n-  Burner mining drill (no other drill found) \n-  Furnace at position(x=60.0, y=-60.0)\n\n### Electricity generator at position(x=117.5, y=-30.5)\nConsists of \n-  Steam engine(position x=117.5, y=-30.5)\n-  Boiler(position x=111.5, y=-32.0)\n-  Offshore pump (position x=106.5, y=-32.5)\n-  Pipe group(position x=107.5, y=-34.5) \n-  Pipe group(position x=105.5, y=-32.5) \n-  Electricity group(position x=114.5, y=-28.666666666666668)\n\n### Transport belt system at position(x=40.5, y=-83.5)\nConsists of \n-  Belt group(position x=40.5, y=-83.5)\n-  Transport belt(position x=63.5, y=-53.5)\n-  Transport belt(position x=64.5, y=-53.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n### Errors when using float values for entity positions\n-  Ensure that all entity positions are integers, as float values cannot be interpreted as integers.\n-  Use the `round()` function or integer division (`//`) to convert float values to integers before passing them to entity position functions.\n\n### Errors when connecting entities to the electric network\n-  Ensure that the steam engine is connected to the electric network by checking the `EntityStatus` of the electricity group.\n-  Use the `connect_entities()` function to connect the steam engine to the electric network.\n\n### Errors when using inserter and furnace\n-  Ensure that the inserter has a source of items to insert into the furnace.\n-  Check the `EntityStatus` of the inserter and furnace to ensure they are working correctly.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n*   Utility functions:\n    *   `connect_entities()`: connects two entities to the electric network.\n    *   `get_entity()`: retrieves an entity by its prototype and position.\n    *   `insert_item()`: inserts an item into a furnace.\n*   Important variables:\n    *   `Prototype`: a dictionary of entity prototypes.\n    *   `Position`: a class representing an entity's position.\n    *   `EntityStatus`: an enum representing an entity's status.\n    *   `Inventory`: a class representing an entity's inventory."}
