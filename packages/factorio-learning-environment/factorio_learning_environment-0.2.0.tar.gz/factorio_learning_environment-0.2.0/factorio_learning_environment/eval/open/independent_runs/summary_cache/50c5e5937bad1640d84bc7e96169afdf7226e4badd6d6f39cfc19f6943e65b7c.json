{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-9.5, 24.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe Group at Position (-9.5, 23.5) connecting the offshore pump\n- Boiler at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (-1.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe Group at Position (-5.5, 22.5) connecting the boiler and steam engine\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0)\n- Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0)\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) connected to a small electric pole network\n- Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (6.5, -59.5)\n\n### Research Lab\nConsists of:\n- Lab with input of automation science packs, located at an unspecified position\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of:\n- Multiple small electric poles forming electricity groups at various positions, including but not limited to (7.5, -60.5), (5.5, -60.5), (3.5, -58.5), etc.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Pipe Connection\n- Ensure there are no blockages or misalignments when connecting pipes between entities. Double-check the positions and paths of pipes to ensure they connect correctly without obstruction.\n\n### Boiler Connection Issues\n- Verify that the boiler is properly connected to the fluid network. Ensure all necessary connections are made and there are no missing pipes or incorrect placements that could prevent the boiler from receiving fluid.\n\n### Inserter Power Issues\n- Make sure inserters are connected to a functioning power network. Check that all electric poles are properly connected and receiving power to avoid inserters being without electricity.\n\n### Fluid Network Disconnection\n- Regularly inspect the fluid network to ensure all components are connected and functioning. Address any warnings or errors related to fluid disconnection promptly to maintain system efficiency."}
