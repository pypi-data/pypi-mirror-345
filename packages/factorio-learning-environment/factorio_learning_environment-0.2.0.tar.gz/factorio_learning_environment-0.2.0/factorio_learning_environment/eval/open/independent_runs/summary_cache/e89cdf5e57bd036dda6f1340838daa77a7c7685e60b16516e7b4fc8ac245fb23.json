{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Belt System at Position (3.5, 1.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Belt group connecting various positions, facilitating the movement of items across the map. The belt system is configured with multiple directional belts, including:\n  - Belt from (4.5, 1.5) to (2.5, 1.5), direction LEFT\n  - Belt from (2.5, 2.5) to (4.5, 2.5), direction RIGHT\n  - Belt from (5.5, 0.5) to (5.5, 2.5), direction DOWN\n  - Belt from (4.5, 2.5) to (5.5, 1.5), direction UP\n  - Additional belts connecting various positions to ensure continuous flow of materials.\n\n### Inserter System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Inserter at position (1.5, -0.5), facing UP, waiting for source items.\n- Burner Inserter at position (3.5, -0.5), facing UP, waiting for source items.\n- Burner Inserter at position (4.5, 1.5), facing UP, waiting for source items.\n\n### Storage System\n- Wooden Chest at position (6.5, 1.5), currently empty, used for storing items transferred by inserters.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting belts\n- Ensure the target position for placing a belt is unoccupied and within the valid range for belt placement.\n\n### Errors with inserter alignment and placement\n- Verify the target position is clear of other objects before attempting to place or adjust inserters.\n- Ensure the correct API function is used for entity manipulation to avoid undefined function errors.\n\n### Errors with entity type handling\n- Ensure the correct entity type is checked when performing operations to avoid NameError related to undefined types.\n\n### Errors with incorrect argument types\n- When inserting items into the belt system, ensure the second argument is an Entity or EntityGroup, not a Position object.\n\n### Timeout Errors\n- Avoid unnecessary delays in the code to prevent TimeoutError, especially in loops or repeated operations."}
