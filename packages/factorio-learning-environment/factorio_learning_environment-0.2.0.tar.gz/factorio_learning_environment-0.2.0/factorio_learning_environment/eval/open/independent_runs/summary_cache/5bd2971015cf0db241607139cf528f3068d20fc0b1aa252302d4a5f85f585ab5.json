{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) with fuel inventory containing coal, currently working.\n- Stone Furnace at position (41.0, -80.0) with no fuel and no ingredients to smelt, currently not operational.\n\n### Iron Plate Mine at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) with no fuel, currently not operational.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) connected to the mining drill for storing mined resources.\n\n### Additional Structures\n- Wooden Chest at position (43.5, -79.5) with normal status, used for storage purposes.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Insufficient Inventory for Insertion\n- Ensure that there is enough coal in the inventory before attempting to insert into furnaces or mining drills. This can be avoided by checking the inventory levels before executing the insert command.\n\n### Timeout Errors\n- Review the logic to ensure that operations are completed within the expected time frame to avoid timeout errors. This may involve optimizing the sequence of actions or checking for potential bottlenecks in the process.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `insert_item`: Used to insert items into entities. Ensure the item and quantity are available in the inventory before calling this function to prevent errors.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `iron_furnace`: Represents the iron furnace entity used in operations, ensure it is correctly referenced and has the required resources for operations.\n- `coal`: Integer representing the amount of coal in the inventory, crucial for fueling operations.\n\nThis report provides a concise overview of the current structures and common errors observed, along with suggestions for improvement."}
