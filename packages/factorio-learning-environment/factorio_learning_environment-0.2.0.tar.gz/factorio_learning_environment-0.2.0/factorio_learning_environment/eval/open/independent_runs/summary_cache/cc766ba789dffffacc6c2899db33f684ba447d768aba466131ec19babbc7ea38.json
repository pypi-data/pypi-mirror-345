{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining Setup at position(41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill mining coal\n- Input chest (iron-chest) at (41.5, -83.5) containing coal\n- Output chest (wooden-chest) at (41.5, -80.5) containing coal\n- Additional storage chest (iron-chest) at (41.5, -84.5) containing coal\n\n### Iron Smelting System around position(46.0, -80.0)\nConsists of:\n- Two stone furnaces at (45.0, -81.0) and (47.0, -81.0)\n- Central iron ore input chest (wooden-chest) at (45.5, -79.5)\n- Two input inserters:\n  - First burner inserter at (44.5, -79.5) feeding first furnace\n  - Second burner inserter at (46.5, -79.5) feeding second furnace\n- Output inserter (burner-inserter) at (48.5, -80.5)\n- Output storage chest (wooden-chest) at (49.5, -80.5) containing iron plates\n\nAdditional storage chests:\n- Wooden chest at (45.5, -84.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Conflicts\n- Before placing entities, verify the target location is clear of other entities\n- Multiple attempts were made to place inserters at occupied positions (44.5, -80.5), (45.0, -80.0), (45.5, -80.5)\n- When rebuilding/modifying existing structures, remove conflicting entities first\n\n### Resource Management\n- Mining drill has stopped due to full output chest - implement a system to regularly empty output chests\n- Ensure proper fuel management for burner devices\n\n### Structure Design\n- When designing automated systems, ensure proper spacing between components to allow for inserter placement\n- Plan entity layouts carefully to avoid placement conflicts\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nFunctions:\n- place_entity(): Places entities on the map\n  Success: When target location is clear\n  Failure: When location is occupied by another entity\n\nImportant Variables:\n- first_inserter: BurnerInserter - Controls input for first furnace\n- second_inserter: BurnerInserter - Controls input for second furnace"}
