{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal\n  - Status: Working\n  - Neighbours: Wooden Chest at (-14.5, -48.5), Burner Inserter at (-13.5, -48.5)\n  - Drop Position: (-14.5, -48.5)\n  - Resources: Iron Ore\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5)\n  - Inventory: Iron Ore, Iron Plates\n  - Status: Normal\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal\n  - Status: No Ingredients\n  - Furnace Result: Iron Plates\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5)\n  - Fuel: Coal\n  - Status: Working\n  - Neighbours: Wooden Chest at (-14.5, -48.5), Burner Mining Drill at (-15.0, -50.0), Stone Furnace at (-12.0, -48.0)\n  - Pickup Position: (-12.5, -48.5)\n  - Drop Position: (-14.5, -48.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Insufficient Fuel\n- Ensure there is enough coal in inventory to refuel all necessary entities like mining drills and inserters to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Production\n- Verify that the furnace has the required ingredients to produce iron plates. Ensure iron ore is consistently supplied to the furnace.\n\n### Errors with Full Inventory\n- Regularly check and clear the chest at the drop position to prevent mining drills from stopping due to full inventory.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Alignment\n- Confirm that inserters are correctly aligned and positioned to transfer materials between entities effectively."}
