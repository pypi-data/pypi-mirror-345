Verify the entity's inventory before extraction.\n\n### Errors when Clearing Space\n- Make sure the target entity or tile contains the items you are trying to clear. Double-check the entity's status and inventory to confirm the presence of items.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Operations\n- Ensure that inserters have a continuous supply of source items and that their destination has space available. Keep track of inserter warnings and address them promptly to maintain efficiency.\n\n### Errors with Storage Management\n- Regularly check the storage capacity of chests and ensure they are not full to avoid mining interruptions. Consider adding additional storage if current capacity is insufficient."}
