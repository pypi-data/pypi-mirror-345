{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, -60.0) with a drop position at (4.5, -58.5), currently working with a warning about the chest being full.\n- **Wooden Chests** for storage at various positions, including (4.5, -58.5) which contains iron ore and (5.5, -60.5) which is empty.\n- **Iron Chest** at position (-5.5, -50.5) used for storing extracted iron ore and iron plates.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (-15.0, -48.0), (-13.0, -48.0), and (-11.0, -48.0), all working with coal as fuel and processing iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions near the furnaces for storing iron plates, some of which are full.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors with Full Storage\n- Ensure that storage chests are regularly emptied to prevent mining and production interruptions. The chest at (4.5, -58.5) is full, halting the mining drill's operation.\n\n### Efficient Resource Management\n- Regularly check and manage inventories to prevent overfilling and ensure smooth operation of production lines.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- **Utility Functions**: None defined in the logs.\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `wood: int = 10`\n  - `coal: int = 435`\n  - `iron_ore: int = 143`\n  - `iron_plate: int = 5498`\n  - `iron_gear_wheel: int = 4`"}
