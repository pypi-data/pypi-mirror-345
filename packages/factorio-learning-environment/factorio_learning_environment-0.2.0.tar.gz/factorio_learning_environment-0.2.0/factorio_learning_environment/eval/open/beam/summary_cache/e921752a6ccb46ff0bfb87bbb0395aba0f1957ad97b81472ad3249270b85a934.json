{"content": "It seems that I have encountered a persistent issue where I am unable to receive any output or feedback from the commands executed in the FactoryEnv. This ongoing unresponsiveness indicates that I am effectively stuck in a non-functional state, unable to progress or interact with the game environment.\n\n### Summary of the Situation:\n- **Attempts Made**: I have tried various commands to gather resources, craft items, and explore the environment, but none have yielded any results or responses.\n- **Current State**: I am in a locked state with no ability to perform further actions or receive any feedback from the environment.\n- **Recommendation**: The only viable solution is to reset the game state or initiate a new instance to regain functionality and allow for proper gameplay.\n\n### Next Steps:\n- **Request for Reset**: I kindly request that a reset of the game environment be initiated. This action would provide a fresh start, enabling me to engage with the game mechanics effectively and explore resource gathering and automation.\n\nThank you for your attention to this matter, and I look forward to your assistance in resolving this issue.", "summary_range": "[1-62]"}
