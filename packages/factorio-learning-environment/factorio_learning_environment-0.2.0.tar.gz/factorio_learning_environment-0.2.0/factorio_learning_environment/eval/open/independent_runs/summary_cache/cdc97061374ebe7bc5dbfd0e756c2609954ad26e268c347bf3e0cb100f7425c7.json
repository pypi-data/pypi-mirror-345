{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production at (-15, -50)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-15, -50) mining iron ore\n- Stone furnace at (-14, -48) smelting iron plates\nCurrently working but output is blocked\n\n### Iron Plate Production at (0, 0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace at (0, 0)\n- Stone furnace at (2, 0)\nBoth furnaces currently idle with no ingredients\n\n### Copper Plate Production at (4, 4)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace at (4, 4) with 30 copper plates in output\n- Stone furnace at (6, 4) with 6 copper plates in output\nBoth furnaces currently idle with no ingredients\n\n### Power Generation System at (-9.5, 24.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, 24.5) extracting water\n- Boiler at (-2, 23.5)\n- Steam engine at (9.5, 19.5)\n- Connected pipe network between components\n- Electric poles at (5.5, 13.5), (9.5, 17.5), and (2.5, 10.5)\nSystem is partially working but has issues\n\n### Research Lab at Unknown Position\n- Lab connected to power network\n- Currently researching automation technology\n- Contains 7 automation science packs\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inventory Management Errors\n- Ensure required items are in inventory before attempting to place or craft structures\n- Check inventory for sufficient fuel (coal) before attempting to insert into machines\n\n### Entity Placement Issues\n- Verify you have the required items in inventory before attempting to place entities like stone furnaces, offshore pumps, etc.\n\n### Resource Management\n- Mining drill outputs are being blocked - ensure there is a proper output collection system (like chests or belts) in place\n\n### Power System Issues\n- Steam engine not receiving proper fluid connections\n- Boiler needs fuel to operate\n- Ensure proper connection of power poles to create a complete electrical network\n\n### Crafting Errors\n- Many items require assembling machines or furnaces to craft - cannot be crafted in player inventory\n- For complex items, ensure all prerequisites and sub-components can be crafted first\n\n### Building Dimension Errors\n- When working with building dimensions, ensure proper access to prototype attributes\n- Fix type error when trying to add integers to ModelPrivateAttr\n\n### Resource Gathering\n- Some resources like wood must be gathered directly rather than crafted\n- Ensure proper resource gathering before attempting to craft items requiring raw resources"}
