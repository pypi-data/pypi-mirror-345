{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-16.0, -51.0) with a drop position at (-16.5, -52.5), extracting iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-14.0, -49.0), fueled by coal, producing iron plates from iron ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Missing Inventory Items\n- Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to place them. For example, attempting to place a burner-mining-drill without having one in inventory results in an error.\n\n### Errors When Placing Entities at Occupied or Invalid Locations\n- Verify that the desired location for placing an entity is unoccupied and valid. Errors occurred when trying to place Wooden Chests, Transport Belts, and Burner Inserters at occupied or invalid locations.\n\n### Furnace Not Producing Iron Plates\n- Check the setup of the furnace to ensure it is correctly configured and has the necessary resources to produce iron plates. This includes ensuring the furnace has fuel and is connected to a source of iron ore.\n\n### General Placement Errors\n- Before placing any entity, ensure the target location is suitable and free from obstructions to avoid placement errors."}
