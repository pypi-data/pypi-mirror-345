{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Setup at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nThis setup is designed to extract and process iron ore into iron plates. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and deposits it into the adjacent chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0): Intended for smelting iron ore into iron plates, though currently not receiving ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities Too Far from Player\n- Ensure you are within the maximum placement distance (10 tiles) from the target position before attempting to place an entity. Move closer to the desired location.\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities on Occupied Tiles\n- Before placing an entity, verify that the target tile is unoccupied and suitable for placement. Adjust the position or direction as necessary to avoid collisions with existing entities.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Alignment and Operation\n- Double-check the alignment and positioning of inserters to ensure they can successfully transfer items between entities. Ensure inserters are properly fueled and positioned to pick up and drop items correctly.\n\n### Errors with Insufficient Fuel\n- Regularly refuel entities such as mining drills, inserters, and furnaces to maintain continuous operation. Monitor fuel levels and replenish as needed to prevent interruptions.\n\n### Errors with Empty or Low Inventory\n- Monitor the inventory levels of chests and furnaces to ensure they contain sufficient materials for processing. Replenish resources as necessary to maintain production flow."}
