expand and reinforce the power network to ensure consistent supply.\n\n\u2022 Entity Placement and Collision Conflicts  \n\u2003\u2013 Repeated collision warnings indicate insufficient spacing among pipe groups and other entities.  \n\u2003\u2013 Mitigation: Verify that placement tiles are unoccupied and maintain adequate separation before placing entities to avoid collisions."}
