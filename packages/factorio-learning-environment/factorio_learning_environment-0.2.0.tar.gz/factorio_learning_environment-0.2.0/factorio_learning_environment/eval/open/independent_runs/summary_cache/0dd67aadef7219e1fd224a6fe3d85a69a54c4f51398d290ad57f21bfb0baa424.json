{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(2.5, 2.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Small electric pole at position (2.5, 2.5)\n- Lab at position (3.5, 0.5) which is currently not powered\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with coal as fuel and producing iron plates\n- Furnace at position (2.0, 0.0) with coal as fuel but currently has no ingredients to smelt\n\n### Chest at position(3.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest at position (3.5, 0.5) which is currently empty\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing new pole\n- Ensure that the first argument passed to the pole placement function is a valid Prototype object. Check the API documentation for the correct usage.\n\n### Errors when the lab is not powered\n- Verify that the lab is connected to a power source. Ensure that there are sufficient electric poles to connect the lab to the electricity network.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient ingredients for research\n- Make sure to gather the required ingredients (in this case, 10 automation science packs) before attempting to complete research. Check your inventory and production lines to ensure you have enough resources.\n\n### General tips\n- Regularly check the status of your entities to ensure they are functioning correctly and have the necessary resources."}
