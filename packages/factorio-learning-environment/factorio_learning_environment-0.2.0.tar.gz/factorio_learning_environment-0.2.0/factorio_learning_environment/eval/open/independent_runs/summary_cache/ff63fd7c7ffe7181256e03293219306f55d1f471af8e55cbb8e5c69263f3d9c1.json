{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-46.5, -119.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (-40.5, -113.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-15.0, -76.0)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0)\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) connected to the furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5) and Position (6.5, -59.5)\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-19.0, -73.0)\n\n### Research Lab\nConsists of:\n- Lab with input of automation science packs at Position (not specified)\n\n### Pipe Network\nConsists of multiple PipeGroups, including:\n- PipeGroup at Position (-48.5, -122.5) with water\n- Several other empty PipeGroups at various positions\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of:\n- Multiple small electric poles at various positions\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Insufficient Resources\n- Ensure you have enough resources in your inventory before attempting to craft or insert items into entities. For example, there was an error when trying to insert coal into the boiler without having coal in the inventory.\n\n### Errors with Entity Placement\n- Ensure you have the necessary entities in your inventory before attempting to place them on the map. For instance, there was an error when trying to place a stone furnace without having one in the inventory.\n\n### Errors with Power and Connectivity\n- Ensure that all entities requiring power are connected to the power network. The steam engine is not connected to the power network, and the inserter is not receiving electricity.\n\n### Errors with Output Blockage\n- Make sure there is a destination entity to accept the output from production entities like drills and furnaces. The burner mining drill is blocked due to no sink entity in place to accept the output."}
