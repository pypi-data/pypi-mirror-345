{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=8.5, y=36.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (x=8.5, y=36.5) with warnings of not being connected to the power network and no input liquid.\n- Boiler at Position (x=-44.5, y=-123.0) with warnings of no input liquid and no fluid present in connections.\n- Offshore Pump at Position (x=-45.5, y=-124.5) with warnings of no fluid present in connections.\n\n### Copper Plate Production at Position (x=-19.0, y=-73.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=-19.0, y=-73.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Iron Plate Production at Position (x=9.0, y=-64.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=9.0, y=-64.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Additional Furnace Setup\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=6.0, y=-62.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Wooden Chest at Position (x=7.5, y=-61.5).\n- Inserter at Position (x=6.5, y=-60.5) not receiving electricity.\n\n### Pipe Network\nConsists of multiple PipeGroups at various positions:\n- PipeGroup at Position (x=-46.5, y=-122.5) with status EMPTY.\n- Additional PipeGroups at positions (x=-1.5, y=11.5), (x=-0.5, y=17.5), (x=-12.5, y=23.5), (x=-4.5, y=24.5), (x=1.5, y=24.5), and (x=2.5, y=25.5), all with status EMPTY.\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of multiple ElectricityGroups:\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at positions (x=7.5, y=-62.5), (x=6.5, y=-63.5), (x=1.5, y=-61.5), etc., with voltage 0.\n- Another ElectricityGroup with poles at positions (x=7.5, y=-11.5), (x=19.5, y=-10.5), (x=20.5, y=-11.5), etc., with voltage 0.\n\n### Lab Setup\n- Lab with input of automation-science-pack: 12 and status NO_POWER.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors with Fluid Connections\n- Ensure that all fluid-related entities like boilers and offshore pumps are properly connected and that there is fluid present in the connections.\n\n### Errors with Electricity Connections\n- Verify that all electrical entities, such as inserters and labs, are connected to a power network and receiving electricity.\n\n### Errors with Boiler Input\n- Make sure that the boiler is receiving water input from the offshore pump. Check the pipe connections between these entities.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Power\n- Ensure inserters are connected to a powered electricity network to avoid them being in a NO_POWER state.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt to avoid them being in a NO_INGREDIENTS state."}
