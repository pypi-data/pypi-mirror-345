{"content": "\"\"\"\nThe furnace status still indicates `NO_INGREDIENTS`, despite having sufficient coal and copper ore. However, it shows that it is now `WORKING`, which means it has started processing the materials.\n\n### Current Inventory Status:\n- **Stone Furnaces**: 3\n- **Wood**: 16\n- **Coal**: 37 (after insertion)\n- **Stone**: 5\n- **Iron Ore**: 10\n- **Copper Ore**: 4 (remaining in the furnace)\n- **Iron Plates**: 3\n- **Copper Plates**: 2 (produced)\n\n### Current Furnace Status:\n- The furnace has 4 pieces of copper ore queued for processing and is actively working to produce copper plates.\n- It has successfully transitioned to a working state, indicating that it is now smelting the copper ore into plates.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Monitor the Smelting Process**: I will keep an eye on the furnace to see how many copper plates it produces.\n2. **Prepare for Iron Smelting**: Once the copper processing is complete, I can shift focus to smelting the iron ore into iron plates.\n\nLet\u2019s wait for the furnace to complete its current operation and check back on the results shortly.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Optionally, we could add a delay or a check to see how many copper plates are produced after some time.\n# For now, let's just check the status of the furnace after a moment.\nprint(f\"Current furnace status: {furnace_entity.status}\")\nprint(f\"Current furnace source: {furnace_entity.furnace_source}\")\nprint(f\"Current furnace result: {furnace_entity.furnace_result}\")", "summary_range": "[1-190]"}
