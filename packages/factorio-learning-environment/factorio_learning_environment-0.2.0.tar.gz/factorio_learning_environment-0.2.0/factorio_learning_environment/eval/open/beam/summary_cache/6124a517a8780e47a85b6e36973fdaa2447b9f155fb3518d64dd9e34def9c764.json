{"content": "I notice several issues from the execution results:\n\n1. The drill is showing \"WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION\" - this means the output is blocked\n2. The inserter is showing \"WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS\" - it's not picking up items from the drill\n3. The furnace shows \"NO_FUEL\" despite us adding coal\n\nLet's try to fix these issues:\n\n```python\n# First clean up existing entities\ndrill = get_entities({Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill})[0]\nfurnace = get_entities({Prototype.StoneFurnace})[0]\ninserters = [e for e in get_entities() if isinstance(e, BurnerInserter)]\n\nprint(\"Cleaning up existing setup...\")\nfor inserter in inserters:\n    pickup_entity(inserter)\npickup_entity(furnace)\n\n# Move to origin to ensure we're in range\nmove_to(Position(0, 0))\nprint(\"Moved to origin\")\n\n# Place furnace with proper spacing relative to drill's drop position\nnew_furnace = place_entity_next_to(\n    Prototype.StoneFurnace,\n    reference_position=drill.drop_position,\n    direction=Direction.RIGHT,\n    spacing=2\n)\nprint(f\"Placed furnace at {new_furnace.position}\")\n\n# Place inserter aligned with drill's drop position\ninserter = place_entity(\n    Prototype.BurnerInserter,\n    position=drill.drop_position\n)\nrotate_entity(inserter, Direction.RIGHT)\nprint(f\"Placed and rotated inserter at {inserter.position}\")\n\n# Add fuel to all machines\nprint(\"Adding fuel...\")\ninsert_item(Prototype.Coal, drill, quantity=5)\ninsert_item(Prototype.Coal, inserter, quantity=1)\ninsert_item(Prototype.Coal, new_furnace, quantity=5)\n\n# Let system work\nprint(\"Waiting for system to process ore...\")\nsleep(10)\n\n# Check final status\nprint(f\"Final status:\")\nprint(f\"Drill status: {drill.status}\")\nprint(f\"Inserter status: {inserter.status}\")\nprint(f\"Furnace status: {new_furnace.status}\")\nprint(f\"Furnace inventory: {inspect_inventory(new_furnace)}\")\n```\n\nThis new approach:\n1. Cleans up all existing inserters to avoid conflicts\n2. Places the furnace relative to the drill's drop position rather than the drill itself\n3. Places the inserter exactly at the drill's drop position\n4. Ensures proper rotation of the inserter\n\nThe goal is to have the inserter perfectly aligned with both the drill's output and the furnace's input.", "summary_range": "[1-3290]"}
