{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-54.5) for iron ore extraction.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=1.5, y=0.5) for storing coal and iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=2.5, y=0.5) transferring items between chests.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=3.5, y=0.5) for additional storage.\n- BeltGroup connecting various parts of the facility for item transport.\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-23.0, y=-68.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=-24.5, y=-67.5) for copper ore extraction.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-21.0, y=-62.0) for smelting copper ore into copper plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-20.5, y=-66.5) and position (x=-17.5, y=-64.5) for transferring items.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-16.5, y=-64.5) for storing iron plates.\n- BeltGroup for transporting items within the facility.\n\n### Coal Mining Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=53.0, y=-83.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=52.5, y=-84.5) for coal extraction.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'tile_dimensions'\n- This error usually occurs when trying to connect entities where one or both entities are not properly initialized or do not exist. Ensure that all entities involved in the connection are correctly placed and initialized before attempting to connect them.\n\n### Output Blocked by Item on the Ground\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity or storage unit available to receive the output from the mining drill to prevent blockage."}
