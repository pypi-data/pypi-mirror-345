{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-3.5, 27.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position (-3.5, 27.5)\n- Boiler at position (-5.5, 25.0)\n- Steam engine at position (-0.5, 25.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting offshore pump to boiler with pipes at positions [(x=-3.5, y=25.5), (x=-3.5, y=26.5)]\n- PipeGroup connecting boiler to steam engine with pipes at positions [(x=-1.5, y=17.5), (x=1.5, y=17.5), (x=0.5, y=17.5), ..., (x=-0.5, y=28.5), (x=0.5, y=28.5), (x=1.5, y=28.5)]\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Furnace at position (15.0, 0.0)\n- Inserter at position (16.5, 0.5) and another at position (17.5, 0.5)\n- Wooden chest at position (5.5, 0.5) and another at position (18.5, 0.5)\n- Small electric pole at position (17.5, -0.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Connecting Entities\n- Ensure that all entities are correctly connected with pipes and that there is no obstruction. Use the correct type of pipe and ensure that the entities are within range.\n\n### Errors in Power Network Connection\n- Make sure that steam engines are connected to the power network. Verify that all necessary electric poles are in place and connected.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Not Receiving Power\n- Check that inserters are connected to a power source and ensure that there is a continuous power supply.\n\n### Errors with Fluid Systems\n- Ensure that all fluid connections are properly established and that there are no leaks or missing connections. Verify that the offshore pump is correctly connected to the boiler and steam engine.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that inserters have access to source items and that the supply chain is not interrupted.\n\n### Errors with Misplaced Pipes\n- Double-check the placement of pipes to ensure they are correctly aligned and connected to the intended entities."}
