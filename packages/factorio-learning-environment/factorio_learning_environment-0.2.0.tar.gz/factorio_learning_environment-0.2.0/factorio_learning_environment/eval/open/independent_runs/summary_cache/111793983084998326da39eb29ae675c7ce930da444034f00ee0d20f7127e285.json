{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (17.5, 20.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (17.5, 20.5)\n- Boiler at position (1.5, 23.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the boiler and steam engine, including pipes at positions such as (3.5, 17.5), (4.5, 17.5), (8.5, 17.5), etc.\n- Pipe network for water supply from the offshore pump, including pipes at positions such as (-9.5, 23.5), (-8.5, 23.5), (-7.5, 23.5), etc.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Attribute Errors on ElectricityGroup\n- Ensure to use the correct attributes for the `ElectricityGroup` object. Attributes like `voltage`, `energy`, and `flow_rate` do not exist. Verify the available attributes in the documentation or by inspecting the object.\n\n### Connection Errors between Boiler and Steam Engine\n- Ensure that the entities you are trying to connect are compatible and correctly positioned. Check that there are no obstacles or misalignments that could prevent the connection.\n\n### Attribute Errors on PipeGroup\n- The `PipeGroup` object does not have a `fluidbox_id` attribute. Verify the correct attributes for `PipeGroup` and ensure you are accessing valid properties.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - `connect_entities(boiler, steam_engine, Prototype.Pipe)`: Attempted to connect pipes between boiler and steam engine but failed due to a nil exception. Ensure that the entities are correctly aligned and the path is clear for connection.\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `electricity_group`: Type `ElectricityGroup`, used incorrectly with non-existent attributes.\n  - `group`: Type `ElectricityGroup`, used incorrectly with non-existent attributes.\n  - `pipe`: Type `PipeGroup`, used incorrectly with non-existent attributes."}
