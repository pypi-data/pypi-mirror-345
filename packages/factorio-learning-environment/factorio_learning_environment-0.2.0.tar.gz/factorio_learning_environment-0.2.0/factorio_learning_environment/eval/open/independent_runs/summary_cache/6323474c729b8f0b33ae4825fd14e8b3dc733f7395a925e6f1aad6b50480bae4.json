This error suggests that there might be a misuse of the 'Chest' object, possibly treating it as a function or callable object. Review the code to ensure proper usage.\n\n### Errors with extracting coal with zero quantity\n- Verify that the chest contains coal before attempting to extract. Ensure that the extraction command is only executed when there is a positive quantity of coal available in the chest."}
