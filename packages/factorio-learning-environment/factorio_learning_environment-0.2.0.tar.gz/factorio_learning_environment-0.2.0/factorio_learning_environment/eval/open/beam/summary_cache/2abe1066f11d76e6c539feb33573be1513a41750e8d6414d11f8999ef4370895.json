{"content": "It seems that the offshore pump is not available in your inventory, which is necessary for setting up a basic power generation system using steam engines. Here's how you can address this issue:\n\n### Steps to Resolve:\n\n1. **Craft or Acquire an Offshore Pump:**\n   - Check if you can craft an offshore pump using available resources.\n   - If crafting is not possible, you may need to acquire one through other means, such as finding it in the environment or through game progression.\n\n2. **Crafting an Offshore Pump:**\n   - Ensure you have the necessary materials to craft an offshore pump. Typically, this includes iron plates, iron gears, and electronic circuits.\n\n3. **Alternative Power Source:**\n   - If crafting or acquiring an offshore pump is not feasible, consider alternative power sources like solar panels, if available.\n\n### Example Code for Crafting an Offshore Pump:\n\n```python\n# Check if you have the materials to craft an offshore pump\nrequired_materials = {\n    Prototype.IronPlate: 5,\n    Prototype.IronGearWheel: 5,\n    Prototype.ElectronicCircuit: 2\n}\n\n# Verify if you have the necessary materials\ninventory = inspect_inventory()\ncan_craft = all(inventory.get(material, 0) >= quantity for material, quantity in required_materials.items())\n\nif can_craft:\n    # Craft the offshore pump\n    crafted_pump = craft_item(Prototype.OffshorePump)\n    assert crafted_pump > 0, \"Failed to craft offshore pump.\"\nelse:\n    print(\"Insufficient materials to craft an offshore pump. Please gather more resources.\")\n\n# If crafting was successful, proceed with the previous steps to set up the power system\n```\n\n### Tips:\n\n- **Resource Gathering:** Ensure you have enough resources in your inventory before attempting to craft complex items.\n- **Inventory Management:** Regularly check your inventory to verify available items and resources.\n- **Alternative Strategies:** If certain items are unavailable, consider alternative strategies or power setups that might be feasible with your current resources.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to either craft or acquire an offshore pump, allowing you to set up a steam engine power system and connect it to your assembling machine.", "summary_range": "[1-142]"}
