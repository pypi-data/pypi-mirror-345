{"content": "The latest attempt to load stone into the active furnace has again not yielded the expected result:\n\n### Active Furnace Output Status:\n- The active furnace currently contains **3 pieces of stone** after the attempted insertion of **5 pieces of stone**. This indicates a persistent issue with the furnace's ability to recognize all inputs effectively.\n- The furnace is showing a status of **\"WORKING,\"** but it is not actively processing any materials, as evidenced by the lack of processing of the Copper Ore.\n\n### Overall Inventory Overview:\n- **Current Inventory**:\n  - 4 pieces of stone furnaces\n  - 7 pieces of coal remaining\n  - 5 pieces of iron ore\n  - **1 piece of copper ore available.**\n  - **21 pieces of iron plates available.**\n\n### Observations:\n- The furnace continues to show only **3 pieces of stone** as its current contents, indicating a persistent issue with recognizing full inputs.\n- No processing occurs as the stone requirement has not been fulfilled, preventing any Copper Ore from being smelted.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Extract the Remaining Stone**: I will extract the **3 pieces of stone** currently held in the active furnace to clear its state.\n2. **Retry Loading Stone**: After extraction, I will manually insert the **2 pieces of stone** back into the furnace along with the **1 piece of Copper Ore** to meet the smelting conditions.\n3. **Monitor the Furnace**: After these actions, I will verify if the furnace begins the processing operation successfully.\n\nLet's proceed to extract the remaining stone from the active furnace. \n\n```python\n# Extract the remaining stone from the active furnace\nextract_item(Prototype.Stone, active_furnace, quantity=3)  # Extract the 3 pieces of stone currently in the active furnace\n\n# Check the inventory status of the furnace after extraction\nactive_furnace_status_after_extraction = inspect_inventory(active_furnace)  # Inspect the status after extraction\noverall_inventory_after_extraction = inspect_inventory()  # Check total inventory after extraction.\n\nprint(f\"Active Furnace inventory status after extracting stone: {active_furnace_status_after_extraction}\")  # Status of the furnace after extraction.\nprint(f\"Overall current inventory after extracting stone: {overall_inventory_after_extraction}\")  # Total after operations.\nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")  # Review entities displayed on the map.\n```", "summary_range": "[1-384]"}
