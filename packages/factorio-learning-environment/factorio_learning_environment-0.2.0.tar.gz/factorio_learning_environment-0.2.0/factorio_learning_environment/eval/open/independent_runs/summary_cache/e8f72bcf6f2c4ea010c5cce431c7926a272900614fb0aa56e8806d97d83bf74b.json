{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-46.5, -123.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-46.5, -123.5)\n- Steam Engine at Position (-40.5, -113.5)\n- Small Electric Poles connecting the steam engine to the power network\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-15.0, -76.0) with a Wooden Chest at Position (-15.5, -77.5)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-19.0, -73.0)\n\n### Copper and Iron Plate Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0) with a Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5)\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) connected to the power network but not receiving electricity\n\n### Laboratory Setup\nConsists of:\n- Lab with input of automation science packs, located in the vicinity of the inserter and small electric poles\n\n### Pipe Network\nConsists of multiple Pipe Groups at various positions, currently empty and not connected to any fluid source.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Finding Nearest Entity\n- Ensure that the entity you are trying to locate exists on the map. In this case, the copper plate was not found, indicating it might not be available on the surface.\n\n### Errors in Connecting Power Network\n- Verify that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to connect power poles.\n- Ensure that the power poles are placed within the connection range of each other to establish a successful power network.\n\n### Errors in Fluid Connection\n- Check for placement blockages before attempting to connect pipes. Ensure the path is clear and the pipes are aligned correctly.\n\n### Errors in Powering Entities\n- Ensure that all entities requiring power are within the range of connected electric poles and that the poles are receiving power from the generator."}
