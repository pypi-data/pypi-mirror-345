{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (22.5, -7.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (22.5, -7.5)\n- Boiler at position (20.5, -4.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (4.5, -10.5)\n- Pipe network connecting these entities, including positions such as (4.5, -9.5), (22.5, -4.5), and others.\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Furnace at position (2.0, 0.0)\n- Furnace at position (5.0, 5.0)\n- Inserter at position (-3.5, 1.5) with a Wooden Chest at position (-3.5, 0.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\n\n### Water Supply System\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at position (19.5, -1.5)\n- Pipe network connecting to the Boiler at position (20.5, -4.0)\n\n### Electrical Network\nConsists of:\n- Electricity Group with poles at positions such as (24.5, -7.5), (18.5, -15.5), and others, providing power to various entities.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure that the pipe connections are correctly aligned and that there is a continuous path between the source and destination entities. The failed connection from position (4.5, -9.5) to (22.5, -3.5) indicates a break in the intended pipeline.\n\n### Errors with Fuel Management\n- Verify that there is sufficient fuel in your inventory before attempting to insert it into entities like boilers. The error \"No coal to insert from your inventory\" suggests checking inventory levels prior to fuel insertion operations.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Power Supply\n- Ensure that inserters are connected to a powered electrical network. The inserter at position (-3.5, 1.5) is not receiving electricity, indicating a need to check the connectivity and power supply of the electrical poles in the vicinity."}
