Consider relocating the pipe placement to a suitable position.\n\n### Errors when Crafting\n- When crafting items that require sub-ingredients, ensure all required materials are available in the inventory. For example, iron plates are necessary for crafting pipe-to-ground.\n\n### Errors when Connecting Pipes\n- Verify that the pipes are correctly connected between entities. Ensure that all necessary connections are made to establish a functional pipeline.\n\n### Errors due to Inventory Shortage\n- Maintain a sufficient inventory of items required for construction and crafting. For instance, ensure enough pipes are available before attempting to place them.\n\n### Attribute Errors\n- Double-check the attribute names and ensure they are correctly spelled and used in the context. For example, use \"PipeGroup\" instead of \"PipeToGround\" if applicable.\n\n### Assertion Errors\n- Ensure that all preconditions are met before executing operations, such as having iron ore available for smelting in the furnace."}
