{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-14.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and drops it at position (-14.5, -48.5).\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-14.0, -48.0): Receives iron ore from the mining drill and smelts it into iron plates. Current inventory includes 51 iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-12.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the mining drill to the stone furnace. It is fueled with coal and is currently waiting for source items.\n\n### Additional Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entity:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0): Currently has no ingredients to smelt and contains 2 iron plates in its inventory.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied or unsuitable tiles\n- Ensure that the target tile is unoccupied and suitable for placement before attempting to place an entity. Consider adjusting the spacing, direction, or reference position to avoid collisions with existing entities or unsuitable terrain like water.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient inventory items\n- Verify that you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into other entities. For instance, ensure you have coal before trying to refuel a mining drill.\n\n### Misalignment of inserters\n- Double-check the alignment of inserters with their source and destination entities to ensure they can correctly transfer items. Adjust the inserter's position if misalignment is detected."}
