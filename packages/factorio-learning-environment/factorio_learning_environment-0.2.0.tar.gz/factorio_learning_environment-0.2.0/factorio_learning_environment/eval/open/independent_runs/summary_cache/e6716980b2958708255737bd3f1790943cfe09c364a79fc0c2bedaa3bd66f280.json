{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -50.0)\n- **Stone Furnace**: Position (-13.0, -50.0)\n  - Used for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n  - Current status: `EntityStatus.NO_INGREDIENTS` (no ingredients to smelt).\n  - Inventory: Contains 3 iron plates and 9 coal.\n\n---\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when placing a stone furnace without having it in inventory\n- Ensure you have crafted the required entity (e.g., stone furnace) before attempting to place it.\n\n#### Errors when inserting items into a furnace without having the required items in inventory\n- Always check your inventory for the required items (e.g., coal, iron ore) before attempting to insert them into a furnace.\n\n#### Errors when extracting items from a furnace that does not contain the expected output\n- Verify the furnace's inventory and status before attempting to extract items. Ensure the furnace has completed smelting and contains the desired output (e.g., iron plates).\n\n#### Errors due to smelting timeout\n- Ensure the furnace has sufficient fuel (e.g., coal) and input materials (e.g., iron ore) to complete the smelting process. Monitor the furnace's status to avoid timeouts.\n\n#### Repeated extraction attempts without verifying furnace output\n- Avoid repeatedly attempting to extract items from a furnace without first confirming the presence of the desired output. Check the furnace's inventory and status before extraction.\n\n#### Errors when furnace has no ingredients to smelt\n- Ensure the furnace is supplied with both fuel and input materials (e.g., coal and iron ore) to avoid the `NO_INGREDIENTS` status."}
