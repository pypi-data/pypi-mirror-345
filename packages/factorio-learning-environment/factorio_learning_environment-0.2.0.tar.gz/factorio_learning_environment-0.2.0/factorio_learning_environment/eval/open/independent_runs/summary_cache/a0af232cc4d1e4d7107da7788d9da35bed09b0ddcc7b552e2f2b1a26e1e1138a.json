Avoid using unsupported keyword arguments (e.g. \u201cradius\u201d) or passing unexpected positional arguments.\n  \u2013 Implement a fallback or null-check mechanism before iterating over the returned entities to prevent errors such as \u201cNoneType is not iterable.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Lab Placement Failures\n  \u2013 Confirm that the lab item exists in the inventory prior to placement. \u201cNo lab in inventory\u201d errors indicate a need to secure the required item before trying to place a Lab.\n\n\u2022 Lab Crafting Shortfalls\n  \u2013 Ensure that all intermediate components (for example, iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, and copper-cables) are available in sufficient quantity.\n  \u2013 Review crafting prerequisites step-by-step so that resource shortages (or missing sub-ingredients) do not hinder Lab crafting.\n\n(No utility functions defined by the agent have been detected in these logs.)\n"}
