{"content": "I see the pattern now. We're having trouble crafting burner inserters because we need iron plates and iron gear wheels. Let's analyze what we've learned from these interactions:\n\n1. Current Inventory Issues:\n- We have limited iron plates (only 4)\n- We don't have any iron gear wheels\n- We don't have enough burner inserters\n\n2. Recipe Requirements:\n- Burner inserter needs:\n  * 1x iron plate\n  * 1x iron gear wheel\n\n3. Failed Approaches:\n- Trying to directly craft burner inserters without checking for ingredients\n- Assuming crafting would work without verifying ingredients\n- Not checking the full recipe chain\n\n4. Successful Patterns to Use:\n- Always check inventory before attempting crafting\n- Verify all ingredients in the recipe chain\n- Craft base ingredients first (iron gear wheels)\n- Then craft the final product (burner inserters)\n\nLet's modify our approach:\n\n```python\n# First check our inventory\ninventory = inspect_inventory()\nprint(f\"Current inventory: {inventory}\")\n\n# Check recipe requirements\nrecipe = get_prototype_recipe(Prototype.BurnerInserter)\nprint(f\"Recipe requirements: {recipe}\")\n\n# First craft iron gear wheels\ncraft_item(Prototype.IronGearWheel, quantity=2)\nprint(\"Crafted iron gear wheels\")\n\n# Now craft burner inserters\ncraft_item(Prototype.BurnerInserter, quantity=2)\nprint(\"Crafted burner inserters\")\n\n# Verify we have all required items\ninventory = inspect_inventory()\nprint(f\"Updated inventory: {inventory}\")\n```\n\nTips for Future API Interactions:\n1. Always check inventory before crafting\n2. Verify complete recipe chains\n3. Craft base materials first\n4. Use proper error handling\n5. Verify success after each step\n6. Keep track of resource requirements\n\nWould you like me to proceed with a new approach that includes crafting the required base materials first?", "summary_range": "[1-1376]"}
