{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0): Extracts iron ore and deposits it into a wooden chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5): Stores extracted iron ore and iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5): Transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the stone furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0): Smelts iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Insufficient Fuel Management\n- Ensure that there is enough coal in the inventory to refuel all necessary entities like mining drills and inserters. Regularly check and replenish coal supplies to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Furnace Production Stoppage\n- Monitor the furnace to ensure it has the necessary ingredients to smelt. The furnace should not be left without iron ore or fuel, as this halts iron plate production.\n\n### Chest Overflow\n- Avoid letting the chest become full, as this stops the mining drill from depositing more iron ore. Regularly extract items from the chest to prevent overflow and maintain mining operations."}
