{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Electricity generator at position(x=117.5, y=-30.5)\nConsists of steam engine(position x=117.5, y=-30.5), boiler(position x=111.5, y=-32.0), offshore pump(position x=106.5, y=-32.5), and pipe connections.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(x=41.0, y=-82.0)\nConsists of following entities\n-  Burner mining drill (position x=41.0, y=-82.0) and a furnace at position(y=-80.0)\n-  Burner inserter (position x=39.5, y=-79.5) and a furnace at position(y=-80.0)\n\n### Offshore pump system at position(x=116.5, y=-54.5)\nConsists of multiple offshore pumps connected in a series, including positions (x=116.5, y=-54.5), (x=115.5, y=-51.5), (x=116.5, y=-53.5), (x=116.5, y=-49.5), (x=116.5, y=-47.5), (x=116.5, y=-45.5), (x=115.5, y=-43.5), (x=115.5, y=-41.5), (x=116.5, y=-40.5), (x=118.5, y=-40.5), (x=120.5, y=-40.5), (x=122.5, y=-39.5), (x=124.5, y=-39.5), (x=126.5, y=-37.5), (x=128.5, y=-35.5), and (x=130.5, y=-33.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n### Errors when using connect_entities function\n-  Ensure that the position objects passed to the function do not have a 'position' attribute, as the function expects the position object itself, not its 'position' attribute.\n-  Ensure that the position coordinates passed to the function are integers, not floats, as the function expects integer coordinates.\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n-  Ensure that the target position is not occupied by another entity before attempting to place a new entity.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n-  `connect_entities` function: \n    -  Failure mode: When the position objects passed have a 'position' attribute or when the position coordinates are floats.\n    -  Success mode: When the position objects passed do not have a 'position' attribute and the position coordinates are integers.\n-  Important variables:\n    -  `offshore_pump`: Position object representing the offshore pump entity.\n    -  `boiler`: Position object representing the boiler entity.\n    -  `Prototype.Pipe`: Prototype object representing the pipe entity."}
