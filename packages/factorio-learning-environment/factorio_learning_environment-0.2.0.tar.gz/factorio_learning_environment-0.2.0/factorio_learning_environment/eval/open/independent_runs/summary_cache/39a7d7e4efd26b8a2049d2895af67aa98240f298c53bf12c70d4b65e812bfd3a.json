{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0) connected to a Stone Furnace at position (x=41.0, y=-80.0).\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=43.5, y=-79.5) for storage.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5).\n\n### Copper Furnace\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-20.0, y=-71.0) fueled with coal.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Insufficient Inventory for Insertion\n- Ensure you have sufficient coal in your inventory before attempting to insert it into furnaces or drills. This will prevent errors related to \"No coal to insert from your inventory.\"\n\n### Errors when Entities Run Out of Fuel\n- Regularly check fuel levels of mining drills and furnaces to prevent them from running out of fuel, which causes them to stop functioning.\n\n### Errors due to Lack of Ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. This will prevent warnings such as \"no ingredients to smelt.\"\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Defined Utility Functions\n- `insert_item`: Used to insert items into entities. Ensure that the source inventory has sufficient items to avoid insertion errors.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `iron_furnace`: Represents the iron furnace entity, used in insertion operations.\n- `copper_furnace`: Represents the copper furnace entity, used in insertion operations."}
