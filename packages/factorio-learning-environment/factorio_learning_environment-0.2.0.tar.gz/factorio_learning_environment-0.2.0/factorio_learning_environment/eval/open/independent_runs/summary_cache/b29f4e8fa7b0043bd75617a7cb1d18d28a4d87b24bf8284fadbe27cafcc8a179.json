{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report (Steps 104-111)\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Chemical Plant Complex at position (0.5, 0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Chemical plant at (0.5, 0.5) (status: NO_POWER, recipe: sulfur)\n- Burner inserters at (-1.5, 0.5) and (2.5, 0.5) (status: WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS)\n- Wooden chests at (-3.5, 0.5) and (4.5, 0.5)\n- Small electric pole at (1.5, 2.5) (status: NO_POWER)\n\n### Boiler System at position (15.5, 11.0)\nConsists of:\n- Boiler at (15.5, 11.0) (status: NOT_CONNECTED, warnings: no input liquid)\n- Pipe connection at (15.5, 9.5) (status: EMPTY)\n- Burner inserter at (15.5, 8.5) (status: OUT_OF_FUEL)\n- Wooden chest at (15.5, 7.5)\n\n### Oil Pumping Station at position (17.5, 40.5)\nConsists of:\n- Pumpjack at (17.5, 40.5) (status: NO_POWER)\n- Pipe-to-ground connection at (18.5, 38.5) (status: EMPTY)\n\n### Extended Pipe Network\nConsists of multiple pipe groups:\n- Main network spanning from (19.5, 50.5) to (33.5, 61.5)\n- Secondary branches at (23.5, 51.5) and surrounding areas\n- All pipes currently empty and unconnected to fluid sources\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Persistent Placement Distance Issues\n- Repeated attempts to place offshore pumps at (100,98) and chemical plants at (50,50) (steps 104,105)\n- Move within 10 tile range before attempting placements\n- Verify target coordinates are within reachable distance\n\n### Entity Reference Problems\n- Attempted to reference undefined 'chem_plant' variable (step 106)\n- Tried to access non-existent chemical plant at (15.5,5.5) (step 107)\n- Always verify entity exists before referencing it\n- Store successful placement results in variables\n\n### Placement Collision Issues\n- Failed inserter placement at (1.0,0.0) due to existing assembler (step 109)\n- Blocked placement next to chest at (2.5,0.5) (step 108)\n- Check for existing entities before placement attempts\n- Consider increasing spacing parameter when placing adjacent entities\n\n### Fluid System Problems\n- Failed petroleum gas insertion (step 111)\n- Chemical plant not receiving required inputs (step 111)\n- Verify fluid connections are properly established\n- Ensure power is available for fluid processing buildings\n\n### Persistent Issues from Previous Reports\n- Placement on occupied/unplaceable tiles (still occurring)\n- Power grid connectivity (still occurring)\n- Entity reference errors (still occurring)\n- Fluid system validation (still occurring)"}
