{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5) for coal storage.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-20.0, -70.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -70.0) and a Stone Furnace at position (-18.0, -70.0) with warnings of no ingredients to smelt.\n- Transport Belt network connecting furnaces and chests for material transport.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-23.0, -68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-23.5, -69.5) for copper ore storage.\n- Transport Belt network facilitating the movement of copper ore to processing units.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -54.5) for iron ore storage.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5) transferring items between chests and belts.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage Facility at Position (1.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5) storing iron plates, coal, and iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) transferring items between chests.\n\n### Transport Belt Networks\n- Multiple BeltGroups facilitating the movement of resources between various mining, processing, and storage facilities.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Undefined Name Error\n- Ensure all entities and classes are properly defined and imported before usage. The error \"NameError: name 'Chest' is not defined\" suggests a missing or incorrect import statement.\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities on Occupied Tiles\n- Before placing an entity, verify that the target position is unoccupied. The error \"Could not place transport-belt at (-25.5, -65.5), entity already exists\" indicates an attempt to place an entity on an already occupied tile. Remove the existing entity or choose a different position."}
