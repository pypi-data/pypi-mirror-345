{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Steam Power Plant\nThis structure is designed for generating electricity. It consists of an offshore pump providing water to two boiler-steam engine pairs via a pipe network. The boilers heat the water into steam, which powers the steam engines. The steam engines are connected by power poles to form a basic electrical grid.\n*   **Offshore Pump** at position (x=-9.5, y=-0.5): Extracts water.\n*   **Boiler 1** at position (x=8.0, y=13.5): Heats water using coal. Connected to Boiler 2 via water pipes.\n*   **Steam Engine 1** at position (x=13.5, y=13.5): Generates power from steam produced by Boiler 1. Connected to the power grid.\n*   **Boiler 2** at position (x=19.0, y=13.5): Heats water using coal. Connected to Steam Engine 2 via water pipes.\n*   **Steam Engine 2** at position (x=24.5, y=13.5): Generates power from steam produced by Boiler 2. Connected to the power grid.\n*   **Pipe Network"}
