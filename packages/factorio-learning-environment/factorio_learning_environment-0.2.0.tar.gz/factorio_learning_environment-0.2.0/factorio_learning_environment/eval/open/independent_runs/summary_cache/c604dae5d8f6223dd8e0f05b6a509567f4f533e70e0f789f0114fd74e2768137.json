{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\n- Boiler at Position (x=1.5, y=23.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting various positions, including (x=1.5, y=21.5) to (x=17.5, y=20.5)\n\nThe electricity generator is designed to produce power by converting steam generated by the boiler, which is fueled by coal, into electricity via the steam engine. The offshore pump supplies water to the boiler.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Reconnecting Pipes\n- Ensure there is no blockage in the path when attempting to connect pipes. Verify that the target position is clear of any obstructions before attempting to reconnect pipes.\n\n### Errors when Placing Small Electric Poles\n- Ensure that there is a suitable position available for placing electric poles. Check for any obstructions or space limitations that may prevent placement.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined by the agent in the provided logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Represents the current inventory of the agent, including items like 'wooden-chest', 'burner-inserter', 'small-electric-pole', 'pipe', etc.\n\nNo utility functions were invoked or defined in the provided logs, and no additional variables were assigned beyond the inventory details."}
