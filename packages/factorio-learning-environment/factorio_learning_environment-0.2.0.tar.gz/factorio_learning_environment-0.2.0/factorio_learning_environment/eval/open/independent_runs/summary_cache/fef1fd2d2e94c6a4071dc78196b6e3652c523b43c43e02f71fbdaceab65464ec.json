{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing Facility at Position (41, -82)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (43.0, -82.0)\n- Iron Chest at position (41.5, -80.5)\n- Iron Chest at position (42.5, -80.5)\n- Burner Inserter at position (43.5, -80.5)\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-15, -50)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-9.0, -48.0)\n- Iron Chest at position (-18.5, -48.5)\n- Iron Chest at position (-16.5, -48.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5)\n- Iron Chest at position (-13.5, -49.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing storage chests\n- Ensure there is no existing object in the way before placing a new storage chest. Check the target location for any occupied tiles.\n\n### Errors when automating resource transfer with inserters\n- Verify that the space next to the reference position is clear before placing a burner inserter. Consider adjusting the spacing or direction if the target position is occupied.\n\n### Errors when extracting from full furnaces\n- Ensure the furnace contains the expected items before attempting extraction. Verify the furnace's inventory status to confirm it contains the desired items.\n\n### Errors when supplying iron ore to furnaces\n- Ensure there is sufficient iron ore in your inventory before attempting to supply it to furnaces. Check inventory levels to avoid insertion failures due to lack of resources."}
