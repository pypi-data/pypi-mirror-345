{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) with a stone furnace at position (41.0, -80.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (43.5, -79.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Mine at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) with a wooden chest at position (-14.5, -48.5)\n\n### Copper Furnace at Position (-20.0, -71.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -71.0)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Timeout Errors\n- Ensure that operations are completed within the expected time frame to avoid TimeoutErrors. Consider optimizing the code or increasing the timeout duration.\n\n### Errors Due to Insufficient Inventory\n- Ensure that there is enough coal in the inventory before attempting to insert it into a furnace or mining drill. Regularly check inventory levels to prevent such errors.\n\n### No Fuel Warnings\n- Regularly refuel mining drills and furnaces to prevent them from running out of fuel and halting production.\n\n### No Ingredients to Smelt Warnings\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Regularly supply raw materials to maintain continuous production.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - `insert_item`: Used for inserting items into entities. Ensure that the source inventory has sufficient items before calling this function.\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `copper_furnace`: Represents the copper furnace entity. Ensure it is correctly referenced and has sufficient fuel and ingredients for smelting.\n  - `iron_furnace`: Represents the iron furnace entity. Ensure it is correctly referenced and has sufficient fuel and ingredients for smelting."}
