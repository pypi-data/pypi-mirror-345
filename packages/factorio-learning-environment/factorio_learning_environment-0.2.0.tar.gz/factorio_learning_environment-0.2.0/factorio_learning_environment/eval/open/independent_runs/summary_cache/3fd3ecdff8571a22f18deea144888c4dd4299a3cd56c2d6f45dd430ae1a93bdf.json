{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (5.5, 27.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Boiler at position (5.5, 27.0) with fuel (coal: 10), but not connected to the fluid system.\n- Steam engine at position (10.5, 34.5), not connected to the power network and lacking input liquid.\n- Offshore pump at position (0.5, 30.5) supplying water to the system.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (15.0, 0.0) with coal as fuel, currently not smelting due to lack of ingredients.\n- Inserters at positions (17.5, 0.5) and (16.5, 0.5), both not connected to power and waiting for source items.\n- Wooden chests at positions (5.5, 0.5) and (18.5, 0.5) for storage.\n\n### Pipe Network\nSeveral pipe groups are present, connecting various fluid systems:\n- PipeGroup at position (-14.5, 14.5), status empty.\n- PipeGroup at position (-14.5, 17.5), status working, carrying water.\n- Additional PipeGroups at various positions, mostly empty, indicating incomplete or non-functional connections.\n\n### Electricity Network\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at various positions, currently not supplying power due to connectivity issues.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors when placing entities too far from the player\n- Move closer to the target position before placing entities. The maximum placement distance is 10 units.\n\n### Errors due to lack of fuel in boilers\n- Ensure that boilers have sufficient fuel before attempting to use them. Regularly check fuel levels and replenish as necessary.\n\n### Errors due to lack of fluid connections\n- Verify that all necessary fluid connections are established between boilers, steam engines, and pumps. Ensure that pipes are correctly connected and not empty.\n\n### Errors due to power network disconnections\n- Check that all electrical entities are connected to the power network. Ensure that poles are properly placed and connected to supply electricity to inserters and other machines."}
