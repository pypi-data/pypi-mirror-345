Check the coordinates carefully before attempting to connect.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity on a tile before attempting to place it. Check for existing entities in the intended position.\n\n### Errors related to power connections\n- Verify that all power connections are properly established. If an entity is not receiving power, check the connections and ensure that they are linked to a power source."}
