{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-20.0, -70.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -70.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (-23.5, -69.5) containing iron ore and copper ore\n- Transport belts connecting the chest to the furnace\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-18.0, -70.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-18.0, -70.0)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-19.0, -65.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -65.0)\n- Burner Inserter at position (-20.5, -66.5) connected to the furnace\n- Wooden Chest at position (-16.5, -64.5) containing iron plates\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Transport System at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (-12.5, -54.5) containing iron ore\n- Transport belts connecting the mining drill to the chest\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5) containing coal, iron ore, and iron plates\n- Burner Inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) connected to the chest\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Connecting Entities\n- Ensure that transport belts are correctly aligned and connected between entities. Verify that there are no gaps or misalignments in the belt connections.\n\n### Errors with Entity Placement\n- Before placing a new entity, check if the target position is already occupied by another entity. Remove any existing entity at the target position before attempting to place a new one.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Operations\n- Ensure that inserters have access to source items and that there is space available at the destination. Check for any blockages or full inventories that may prevent inserters from operating correctly.\n\n### Errors with Fuel Management\n- Regularly check the fuel levels of burner mining drills and inserters to ensure continuous operation. Refill fuel as necessary to prevent stoppages."}
