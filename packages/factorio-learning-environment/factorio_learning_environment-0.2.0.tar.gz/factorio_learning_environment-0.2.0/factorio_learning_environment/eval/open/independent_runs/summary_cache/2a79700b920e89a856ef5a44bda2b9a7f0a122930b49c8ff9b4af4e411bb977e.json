{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing Facility at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) connected to a Stone Furnace at position (43.0, -82.0)\n- Iron Chest at position (41.5, -80.5) and another at position (42.5, -80.5) for storage\n- Burner Inserter at position (43.5, -80.5) for transferring items between chests and furnace\n- Additional Iron Chests at positions (44.5, -80.5), (45.5, -80.5), (47.5, -80.5), and (49.5, -80.5) for extended storage\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) connected to a Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0)\n- Iron Chests at positions (-18.5, -48.5), (-16.5, -48.5), (-15.5, -48.5), and (-13.5, -49.5) for storage\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) for additional storage\n- Burner Inserters at positions (-10.5, -49.5), (-11.5, -49.5), and (-8.5, -49.5) for transferring items between chests and furnaces\n- Stone Furnaces at positions (-11.0, -48.0) and (-9.0, -48.0) for smelting iron ore\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Items\n- Ensure that the supply chain is not interrupted and that there are sufficient items upstream for the inserters at positions (-12.5, -44.5), (-10.5, -44.5), and (-8.5, -44.5).\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Space in Destination\n- Ensure that the destination for the inserters is not full. Check the output chests or belts to ensure they have space to accept more items.\n\n### Furnace No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Ensure that furnaces have a continuous supply of raw materials to process. Check the input chests or belts to ensure they are supplying the necessary ingredients.\n\n### Furnace Result is Full\n- Ensure that the output of the furnace is being cleared regularly to prevent it from becoming full and halting production."}
