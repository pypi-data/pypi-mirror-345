{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron ore mining and smelting structure at position around (17.5, 72.5)\nConsists of the following connected entities:\n- Electric mining drill at position (17.5, 72.5) facing down, powered but output blocked due to furnace belt blockage.\n- Stone furnace at position (18.0, 75.0) fueled with coal, working but with full input inventory and output frequently full.\n- Wooden chests at positions (19.5, 75.5), (21.5, 75.5), and (21.5, 77.5) serving as storage and input/output buffers for iron plates.\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5) and (20.5, 77.5) fueled and operational, moving items between chests and furnace.\n- Small electric pole at (15.5, 75.5) connected to power network.\n- Persistent output blockage warning at furnace belt drop position affecting mining drill operation.\n\nThis structure enables iron ore extraction, smelting, and staged iron plate storage with stable power and inserter fueling, but output belt blockage remains unresolved.\n\n### Steam power generation structure at position around (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, -0.5) extracting water.\n- Boiler at (-5.0, 2.5) fueled with coal, currently working but recently reported out of fuel once.\n- Steam engine at (0.5, 6.5) connected to boiler by pipes, working and generating power.\n- Small electric poles placed near steam engine (0.5, 6.5), boiler (-4.5, -0.5), and additional poles at (17.5, 72.5) and (25.5, 80.5) forming a connected power network.\n\nThis structure reliably generates electricity from steam power, supplying the factory\u2019s electric network.\n\n### Iron gear wheel assembly structure at position around (25.5, 80.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine 2 at (25.5, 80.5), powered and connected to small electric pole at (25.5, 80.5).\n- Input wooden chest at (21.5, 75.5) feeding iron plates into assembly area.\n- Output wooden chest at (25.5, 82.5) with burner inserter at (25.5, 83.5) fueled and operational, moving assembled items into output chest.\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 77.5) and (25.5, 83.5) fueled and operational.\n- Assembling machine repeatedly reports shortage of iron plates preventing crafting despite iron plates being inserted into input chest and assembler.\n\nThis structure is intended for iron gear wheel production and now has power and output inserter setup but suffers from input material not reaching the assembler inventory.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Persistent output blockage at furnace output belt\n- The electric mining drill at (17.5, 72.5) continues to report \"furnace belt at drop position is blocked,\" causing output blockage and preventing further mining output.\n- The furnace at (18.0, 75.0) frequently has full output inventory, blocking smelting output.\n- To resolve, clear or extend output belts and chests to accept items from the furnace.\n- Verify inserters and belts downstream are not full or blocked to maintain continuous flow.\n\n### Assembling machine input inventory remains empty despite input chest stocked\n- Iron plates are inserted into the input chest at (21.5, 75.5) and even directly into the assembler at (25.5, 80.5), but the assembler\u2019s input inventory remains empty.\n- This causes the assembler to report ingredient shortage and prevents crafting.\n- Ensure inserters feeding the assembling machine are correctly placed and operational to transfer iron plates from input chest to assembler.\n- Check inserter pickup and drop positions and confirm no blockage or fuel issues.\n- Consider using inserters with appropriate direction and range to connect input chest and assembler.\n\n### Entity placement conflicts due to occupied tiles\n- Attempts to place small electric poles near (18.0, 75.0) failed due to collisions with existing mining drill at (17.5, 72.5) or water tiles.\n- To avoid placement conflicts, verify tile occupancy and surroundings before placing poles.\n- Adjust spacing, direction, or reference position to find valid placement tiles.\n\n### Inserter fuel and inventory management\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5), (20.5, 77.5), and (25.5, 83.5) are consistently fueled and operational.\n- Continue monitoring inserter fuel levels to prevent stoppages.\n- Inserters sometimes report waiting for source items, indicating upstream supply issues.\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nNo new user-defined functions have been defined"}
