{"content": "Here is the updated report:\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Primary Power Generation System (Updated)\n- **Offshore pump** at (-9.5, 0.5) - Water source (status: NOT_CONNECTED)\n- **Boiler** at (0.0, 0.5) - Steam production (fueled with coal, status: NOT_CONNECTED)\n- **Steam engine** at (3.5, 0.5) - Power generation (status: NOT_CONNECTED)\n- **Underground belt** at (1.5, 0.5) - Partial connection attempt\n- Missing pipe connections between components\n- New steam engine position at (3.5, 0.5) instead of previous (6.5, 0.5)\n\n### Remote Production Outpost (Unchanged)\n- **Assembling machine 2** at (50.5, 50.5) - Circuit production (no power)\n- **Wooden chests** at (48.5, 50.5) and (52.5, 50.5) - Empty storage\n- Connected to power pole at (49.5, 48.5)\n\n### Mining Operations (Unchanged)\n- Iron drill at (15.5, 70.5) - Output still blocked\n- Copper drill at (-46.5, 70.5) - Output still blocked\n- Associated furnaces at (16.0, 74.0) and (-46.0, 74.0) - Inactive\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Placement Collisions (Critical)\n- 18+ failed placement attempts due to:\n  1. Existing objects in target positions (6.0, 0.0) and (1.5, 0.0)\n  2. Repeated attempts at same blocked positions\n- Required solutions:\n  1. Implement clear_entity() before rebuilds\n  2. Use get_colliding_entities() pre-check\n  3. Maintain build area cleanup\n\n### Distance Placement Errors (New)\n- Failed placement at (10.0, 5.0) due to:\n  1. Exceeding maximum placement distance (11.18 > 10)\n- Required fixes:\n  1. Verify distance before placement\n  2. Move character closer to target\n  3. Implement distance validation wrapper\n\n### Power System Design (Persistent)\n- Continued partial builds with connection failures\n- Critical issues:\n  1. Broken pipe connections at (1.5, 0.0) and (2.0, 0.0)\n  2. Unverified fluid systems\n- Design requirements:\n  1. Complete one subsystem before proceeding\n  2. Verify all connection points\n  3. Clear existing pipes before replacement\n\n### Position Validation (Ongoing)\n- Multiple millimeter-precision placement failures\n- Required improvements:\n  1. Use integer grid coordinates\n  2. Implement position snapping\n  3. Validate against entity dimensions\n\n### Previous Unresolved Issues\n- Mining drill outputs still blocked\n- Remote assembler remains unpowered\n- Primary power plant incomplete\n- No functional production lines\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Defined Functions\n- `find_clear_land_near_power()` -> Position\n  - Still failing due to undefined dependencies\n  - Needs terrain validation implementation\n\n### Important Variables\n- `boiler`: Primary steam producer at (0.0, 0.5)\n- `steam_engine`: Power generator at (3.5, 0.5)\n- `underground_belt`: Misplaced connector at (1.5, 0.5)"}
