The inventory shows that I have 25 coal, but I was unable to insert it into the furnace, which remains non-operational.\n\n### Current Situation:\n1. The furnace has produced 66 iron plates but cannot operate due to lack of fuel and iron ore.\n2. There seems to be a persistent issue with inserting coal into the furnace, which may require a different approach.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Recheck the Furnace**: I will attempt to place the coal into the furnace again, ensuring that there are no issues with the coal type.\n2. **Gather More Resources**: If the insertion continues to fail, I may need to gather more coal or check if there are any other issues with the furnace itself.\n3. **Restart the Furnace**: If necessary, I can consider placing a new furnace if the current one is malfunctioning.\n\nLet's try inserting the coal into the furnace again.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Step 1: Attempt to insert coal into the furnace again.\ntry:\n    insert_item(Prototype.Coal, furnace, quantity=current_inventory[Prototype.Coal])  # Use available coal\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"Error occurred while inserting coal: {e}\")\n\n# Step 2: Verify the furnace inventory after the insertion attempt.\nfurnace_inventory_after_attempt = inspect_inventory(furnace)\nprint(f\"Furnace inventory after coal insertion attempt: {furnace_inventory_after_attempt}\")\n\n# Step 3: Check the overall inventory again.\nfinal_inventory_after_attempt = inspect_inventory()\nprint(f\"Final Inventory after coal insertion attempt: {final_inventory_after_attempt}\")", "summary_range": "[1-58]"}
