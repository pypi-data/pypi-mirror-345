{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\u2022 No new structures have been successfully created on the map. Multiple attempts were made to establish a Lab at position (0.5, 2.5) intended to supply Automation Science Packs for research, but each placement and crafting attempt failed due to missing lab items and insufficient resources.  \n\u2022 Although operations were performed using furnaces (for example, an alternative furnace at Position(x=5.0, y=5.0) for iron smelting and a copper furnace at Position(x=-27.0, y=-60.0) for copper ore processing), these were pre\u2010existing and not built or placed by the agent.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 get_entities API Usage Errors  \n  \u2013 Avoid supplying unexpected keywords (such as 'radius') or an incorrect number of positional arguments. Verify the API\u2019s signature and call it accordingly.\n\n\u2022 Lab Placement and Retrieval Issues  \n  \u2013 Ensure the lab item is available in the inventory before attempting placement at a target tile.  \n  \u2013 Include validation checks to handle cases when retrieval functions return None, instead of attempting to iterate over a NoneType.\n\n\u2022 Lab Crafting Failures Due to Insufficient Resources  \n  \u2013 Confirm that all required sub-ingredients (e.g., iron-plate, iron-gear-wheel, copper-plate, copper-cable, electronic-circuit) are available or producible via an established smelting/crafting chain.  \n  \u2013 Monitor and resolve chain dependencies so that the prerequisites for lab crafting are met before initiating the process."}
