{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-12.0, -48.0) and (-10.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) which extracts iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-15.5, -48.5) and (-14.5, -48.5) for storing extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserters** at positions (-13.5, -48.5) and (-14.5, -47.5) for transferring iron ore from chests to furnaces.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (-12.0, -48.0) and (-10.0, -48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-8.5, -47.5) for transferring iron plates from the furnace to the output chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-7.5, -47.5) for storing produced iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entities (e.g., chests or drills) contain items before relying on inserters to transfer items. Regularly check and replenish the source inventory to prevent inserters from idling.\n\n### Errors with Empty Output Chests\n- Regularly monitor and clear output chests to prevent production bottlenecks. Ensure that there is a consistent flow of items from production to storage.\n\n### Errors with Resource Supply to Furnaces\n- Maintain a steady supply of resources such as iron ore and coal to furnaces to ensure continuous production. Monitor resource levels and automate supply chains where possible to avoid manual intervention."}
