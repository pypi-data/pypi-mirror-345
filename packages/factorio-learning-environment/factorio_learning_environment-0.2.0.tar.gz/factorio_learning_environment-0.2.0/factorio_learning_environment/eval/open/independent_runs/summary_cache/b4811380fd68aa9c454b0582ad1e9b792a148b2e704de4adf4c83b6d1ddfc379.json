{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Oil Extraction System at (17.5,40.5)\n- **Pumpjack** at (17.5,40.5) - Currently non-operational (no power)\n- **Main Storage tank** at (21.5,41.5) - Disconnected from system\n- **Remote Storage tank** at (15.5,35.5) - Disconnected from system\n- Previous PipeGroup connections (fluid_system=2860) dismantled\n\n### Power Generation System (DISMANTLED)\n- Previous components removed:\n  - Boiler at (26.5,42.0)\n  - Steam engine at (29.5,42.5)\n- Only remaining component:\n  - **Offshore pump** at (-11.5,21.5) - Disconnected, not operational\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Fluid System Connection Failures\n1. **Connection validation issues** (occurred 4 times)\n   - Always verify:\n     - Source and target connection points are aligned\n     - No obstructions between connection points\n     - Correct fluid types match between components\n   - Solution: Implement pre-connection validation checks\n\n2. **Entity positioning errors** (occurred 3 times)\n   - Failed to place boiler at (26.5,47.0) due to water\n   - Solution:\n     - Use terrain scanning before placement\n     - Maintain minimum land buffer around water sources\n\n3. **Power system expansion failures**\n   - Secondary boiler at (29.5,50.0) never became operational\n   - Solution:\n     - Complete ALL connections (water+fuel+steam) before activation\n     - Verify full system integrity before bringing online\n\n4. **Critical system collapse**\n   - Complete power loss led to cascading failures\n   - Solution:\n     - Maintain backup power source during expansions\n     - Implement staged activation procedures\n\n5. **Entity reference errors**\n   - Attempted to access non-existent boiler at (26.5,42.0)\n   - Solution:\n     - Verify entity existence before operations\n     - Implement null-checking for all entity references\n\n6. **Attribute access errors**\n   - Failed to access position attributes on offshore pump\n   - Solution:\n     - Always verify object structure before access\n     - Use proper type hints and validation\n\n### Emergency Procedures\n1. **Current failures require**:\n   - Complete power system rebuild\n   - New fluid network implementation\n   - Staged reactivation of oil extraction\n\n2. **Rebuild priorities**:\n   1. Establish stable power generation\n   2. Restore pumpjack operations\n   3. Reconnect storage systems\n   4. Implement monitoring before expansion\n\n### Maintenance Protocols\n- All previous recommendations remain critical:\n  1. Document all system connections\n  2. Maintain construction blueprints\n  3. Implement automated diagnostics\n  4. Create isolation procedures for failures"}
