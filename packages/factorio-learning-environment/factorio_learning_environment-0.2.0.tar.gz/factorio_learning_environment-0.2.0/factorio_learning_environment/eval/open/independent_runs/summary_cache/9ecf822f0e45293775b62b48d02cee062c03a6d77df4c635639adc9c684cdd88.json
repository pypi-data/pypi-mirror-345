{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n###Iron Plate Production Line at y=0.0\nConsists of four stone furnaces in a row:\n- Working furnace at x=0.0 (contains coal but no ore, has some iron plates)\n- Working furnace at x=2.0 (contains coal but no ore, has some iron plates)\n- Working furnace at x=4.0 (contains coal and iron ore, actively producing iron plates)\n- Working furnace at x=6.0 (contains coal and iron ore, actively producing iron plates)\n\nERROR TIPS\n### Resource availability errors\n- Check inventory for required resources before attempting to insert items into entities\n- Ensure you have both fuel (coal) and raw materials (ore) before setting up multiple furnaces\n- Consider harvesting more resources when inventory is depleted instead of continuing to place empty structures\n\n### Furnace efficiency\n- Avoid placing furnaces without having resources ready to fuel and supply them\n- Set up furnaces one at a time, ensuring each is properly supplied before moving to the next one\n- When extracting products from furnaces, immediately resupply them with raw materials to maintain continuous production\n- Monitor furnace warnings like 'no ingredients to smelt' and address them promptly to maintain production efficiency\n\n### Inventory management\n- Keep track of extracted items - logs show \"Total iron plates collected: 0\" despite extracting 44 plates\n- Verify successful extraction operations by checking inventory contents before and after extraction"}
