{"content": "It seems like the execution result is not being displayed, which could be due to several reasons related to the environment setup or the way the output is being captured. Here are some steps and tips to troubleshoot and ensure the output is visible:\n\n1. **Environment Configuration**: Ensure that the environment where the code is being executed is configured to display output. Sometimes, the output might be redirected or suppressed due to environment settings.\n\n2. **Output Capture**: Check if there is any mechanism in place that might be capturing the output and not displaying it. This could be due to logging configurations or output redirection settings.\n\n3. **Error Handling**: If there are any exceptions being raised, ensure they are being caught and printed correctly. The exception handling block should be set up to catch and display any errors.\n\n4. **Debugging Statements**: Add additional print statements at various points in the code to verify that the code is executing as expected. This can help identify where the issue might be occurring.\n\n5. **Execution Context**: Verify that the code is being executed in the correct context where the Factorio REPL environment is properly initialized and running.\n\n6. **Log Files**: If there are log files available, check them for any errors or warnings that might indicate why the output is not being displayed.\n\nHere\u2019s a simplified version of the code with additional debugging statements:\n\n```python\ntry:\n    # Retrieve and validate entities\n    entities = {\n        \"Offshore Pump\": get_entities({Prototype.OffshorePump}),\n        \"Boiler\": get_entities({Prototype.Boiler}),\n        \"Steam Engine\": get_entities({Prototype.SteamEngine}),\n        \"Electric Pole\": get_entities({Prototype.SmallElectricPole}),\n        \"Assembling Machine\": get_entities({Prototype.AssemblingMachine1}),\n    }\n\n    for name, entity_list in entities.items():\n        if not entity_list:\n            raise AssertionError(f\"{name} is missing!\")\n        print(f\"{name} is present.\")\n\n    # Assign entities\n    offshore_pump = entities[\"Offshore Pump\"][0]\n    boiler = entities[\"Boiler\"][0]\n    steam_engine = entities[\"Steam Engine\"][0]\n    electric_pole = entities[\"Electric Pole\"][0]\n    assembling_machine = entities[\"Assembling Machine\"][0]\n\n    # Check and refuel boiler\n    move_to(boiler.position)\n    current_coal = inspect_inventory(boiler).get(Prototype.Coal, 0)\n    print(f\"Boiler current coal level: {current_coal}\")\n    if current_coal < 5:\n        insert_item(Prototype.Coal, boiler, 10 - current_coal)\n        current_coal = inspect_inventory(boiler).get(Prototype.Coal, 0)\n        print(f\"Boiler refueled.
