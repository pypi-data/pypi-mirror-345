{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Site at position(x=-15.5, y=-50.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position x=-15.5, y=-50.5) that extracts iron ore.\n\n### Furnace at position(x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace (position x=-15.0, y=-50.0) that processes iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Wooden Chest at position(x=41.5, y=-80.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest (position x=41.5, y=-80.5) that stores coal.\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position(x=41.0, y=-82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position x=41.0, y=-82.0) that extracts coal.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n- **Errors when inserting items into the furnace without available inventory**\n  - Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into the furnace. Check your inventory status regularly to avoid such errors.\n\n- **Errors when using extracting but being too far**\n  - Move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n- **Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity**\n  - Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions**\n  - `insert_item`: Used to insert items into entities like furnaces. \n    - Failure Mode: Could not insert due to no items available in inventory.\n    - Success Mode: Successfully inserts items when inventory has the required items.\n\n- **Important Variables**\n  - `furnace`: Furnace entity at position x=-15.0, y=-50.0 (type: Furnace)\n  - `burner_mining_drill`: Burner mining drill entity at position x=41.0, y=-82.0 (type: BurnerMiningDrill)\n  - `wooden_chest`: Wooden chest entity at position x=41.5, y=-80.5 (type: Chest)\n  - `iron_ore_position`: Nearest iron ore position (type: Position)\n  - `coal_amount`: Amount of coal in inventory (type: Integer)"}
