For example, 'offshore_pump' should be defined before being used in the 'place_entity_next_to' function.\n\n### Errors when connecting entities directly\n- Transport belts cannot be connected directly from a Prototype.WoodenChest object as a source. You need to add an inserter that takes items from Prototype.WoodenChest and use the inserter as a source entity.\n\n### Errors when connecting to an occupied position\n- Ensure that the target position for connection is not occupied by another entity. For example, when connecting an inserter to a belt, make sure the drop position is not occupied.\n\n### Errors when placing entities too far away\n- Ensure that you are within the maximum allowed distance when placing entities. Move closer to the target position before attempting to place the entity.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into a furnace\n- Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into a furnace.\n\n### Errors when researching a technology that is already researched\n- Check if a technology is already researched before attempting to research it again.\n\n### Errors when crafting items without required sub-ingredients\n- Ensure that you have the required sub-ingredients in your inventory or have a machine that can craft them before attempting to craft an item.\n\n### Errors when getting non-existent entities\n- Ensure that the entity you are trying to get exists at the specified position before attempting to get it.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Important Variables\n- offshore_pump: OffshorePump \n- boiler: Boiler \n- steam_engine: Generator \n- furnace: Furnace \n\n### Utility Functions\nNo utility functions have been defined by the agent in the given logs."}
