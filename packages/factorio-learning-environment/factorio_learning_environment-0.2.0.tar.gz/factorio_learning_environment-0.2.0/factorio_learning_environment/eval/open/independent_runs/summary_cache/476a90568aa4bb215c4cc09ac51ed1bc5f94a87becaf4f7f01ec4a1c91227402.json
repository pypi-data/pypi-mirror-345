Always retrieve and use the current valid fluid_system (now [37604]) from the boiler or offshore pump.\n\u2500 Rigid Pipeline Stabilization:\n  \u2022 Fixed 10-second delays for pipeline stabilization proved insufficient; adopt dynamic connectivity checks to ensure PipeGroup readiness before initiating connection attempts.\n\u2500 Persistently Failed Steam Engine Connection and Direct Pipeline Failures:\n  \u2022 Repeated connection attempts\u2014including direct piping between the boiler and steam engine\u2014failed due to misaligned or blocked connection points. Verify that source and target connection points are unobstructed and compatible for fluid transfer.\n\u2500 Fuel Supply Management:\n  \u2022 Initial failure to fuel the boiler led to subsequent connection issues. Maintain timely refueling to achieve a FULL_OUTPUT status before attempting pipeline connections."}
