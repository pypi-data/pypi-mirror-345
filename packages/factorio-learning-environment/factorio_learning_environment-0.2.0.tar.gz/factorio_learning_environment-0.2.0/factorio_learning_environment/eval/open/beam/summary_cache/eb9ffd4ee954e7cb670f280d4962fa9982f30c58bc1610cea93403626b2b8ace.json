{"content": "The error indicates that there are no coal resources available at the specified coordinates (0.0, 0.0). This suggests that I need to search for resources more effectively by using the `nearest()` function to find the closest resource patch instead of hardcoding the position.\n\n### Summary of Attempts and Errors:\n1. **Attempted to get a coal resource patch** at a fixed position (0.0, 0.0).\n2. **Error occurred** because there was no coal at that location.\n\n### Tips and Logic Patterns to Avoid Future Errors:\n1. **Use the `nearest()` Function**: Instead of specifying a fixed position, always use the `nearest()` function to dynamically find the closest resource patch. This ensures that I am targeting the correct location where resources are available.\n\n2. **Check Resource Availability**: Before attempting to gather resources, check if the resource patch exists and has a sufficient size. This can prevent errors related to trying to gather from non-existent patches.\n\n3. **Fallback Mechanism**: Implement a fallback mechanism that checks for alternative resources if the primary resource (like coal) is not available. This can be done by sequentially checking for other resource types.\n\n4. **Initial Resource Gathering**: Start with basic resources like coal or iron ore, as they are essential for crafting initial entities (like furnaces and drills).\n\n5. **Error Handling**: Implement error handling to catch exceptions when trying to access resources, allowing for graceful recovery or alternative actions.\n\n### Revised Approach:\n1. Use `nearest(Resource.Coal)` to find the closest coal resource.\n2. If coal is not available, then use `nearest(Resource.IronOre)` to find iron ore.\n3. Move to the identified resource patch and gather resources.\n\nThis approach will help ensure that I can successfully collect the necessary resources to begin crafting and building entities.", "summary_range": "[1-4]"}
