{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position (42.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 42.0, -83.0)\n- Burner inserter (position 43.5, -81.5) that is waiting for space in destination\n- Wooden chest (position 42.5, -81.5) that contains coal\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position 0.0, 0.0) that is working and has iron ore and iron plates in its inventory\n\n### Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest (position -14.5, -48.5) that is normal and currently empty\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position -15.0, -50.0) that is currently out of fuel\n- Wooden chest (position -14.5, -48.5) that is normal and currently empty\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n- **Errors when the Wooden Chest has no iron ore**: Ensure to check the inventory of the Wooden Chest before attempting to insert iron ore into the Stone Furnace. If it is empty, consider mining more iron ore or finding another source.\n- **Errors when the burner mining drill is out of fuel**: Regularly check the fuel levels of the burner mining drill. Ensure it is refueled promptly to maintain its operation.\n- **Errors when inserters are waiting for source items**: Make sure that the source items are available in the connected entities. If the inserter is waiting for items, check the inventory of the source entity.\n- **Errors when inserters are waiting for space in destination**: Ensure that the destination entity has enough space to receive items. If it is full, consider emptying it or adjusting the production flow.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- **Utility Functions**: \n  - `insert_item(entity, item)`: Successfully invoked to insert coal into the burner mining drill and stone furnace.\n  - `extract_item(entity)`: Successfully invoked to extract coal from the wooden chest.\n\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `coal: int` - Assigned values representing the amount of coal available.\n  - `iron_ore: int` - Assigned values representing the amount of iron ore available.\n  - `iron_plate: int` - Assigned values representing the amount of iron plates available.\n  - `burner_mining_drill_status: str` - Assigned values representing the operational status of the burner mining drill."}
