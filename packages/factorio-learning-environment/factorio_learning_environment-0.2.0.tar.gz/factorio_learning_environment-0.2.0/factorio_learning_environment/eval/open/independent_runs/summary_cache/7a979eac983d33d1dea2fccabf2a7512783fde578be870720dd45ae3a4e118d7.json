{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-44.5, -124.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (-40.5, -113.5)\n- Connected with a series of pipes and small electric poles to facilitate water and steam flow.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -76.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-15.0, -76.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at Position (-15.5, -77.5) for ore collection.\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-19.0, -73.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Copper Plate Production at Position (9.0, -64.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0) for smelting copper ore into copper plates.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage and Processing Facility at Position (6.0, -62.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) for moving items between entities.\n- Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5) for storing iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Entities without Required Items\n- Ensure you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to connect entities. For example, when connecting small electric poles, make sure you have enough poles crafted and available.\n\n### Errors due to Full Inventory at Drop Position\n- Regularly check and empty chests at drop positions to prevent mining drills from stopping due to full inventory.\n\n### Errors Related to Power Connection\n- Verify that all power-producing and consuming entities are properly connected to the power network to avoid warnings like \"not connected to power network\" or \"no power.\""}
