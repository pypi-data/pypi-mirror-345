Both furnaces are operational. We should let them continue processing their respective iron ore.\n2. Once they finish, we can check back on their inventory and gather more iron ore to maintain production.\n\nLet's wait briefly to see how many more iron plates are produced after a short period.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Wait for a specified amount of time to allow the furnaces to process their iron ore\nsleep(10)  # Adjust this duration if needed\n\n# Check the inventory and entity status after waiting\nprint(f\"Inventory after waiting for production: {inspect_inventory()}\")\nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")", "summary_range": "[1-148]"}
