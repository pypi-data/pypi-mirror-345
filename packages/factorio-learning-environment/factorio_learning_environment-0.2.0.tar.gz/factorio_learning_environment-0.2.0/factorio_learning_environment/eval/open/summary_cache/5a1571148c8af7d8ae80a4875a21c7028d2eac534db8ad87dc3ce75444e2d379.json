{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron plate production setup at position around (16.0, 71.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (16.0, 71.0) facing down, extracting iron ore.\n- Stone furnace at position (16.0, 73.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden chest at position (17.5, 73.5) collecting iron plates from the furnace.\n- Burner inserter at position (16.5, 74.5) transferring iron ore from the mining drill to the furnace.\n- Burner inserter at position (18.5, 73.5) moving iron plates from the furnace to the wooden chest.\n- Burner inserter at position (19.5, 73.5) moving iron plates from the wooden chest to a transport belt.\n- Transport belt at position (21.5, 73.5) moving iron plates away from the chest.\n- Wooden chest at position (22.5, 73.5) placed to receive iron plates from the transport belt.\n\nThis structure forms a connected iron plate production line from ore extraction to plate output onto a belt and then into a secondary chest.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors placing entities due to occupied tiles and spacing issues\n- Transport belt placement repeatedly failed near (19.5, 73.5) and (21.5, 73.5) due to existing entities occupying tiles. Increasing spacing or changing placement direction is necessary to avoid overlap.\n- Attempting to place burner inserters between belt and chest at (22.5, 73.5) failed because the belt occupied the tile. Plan entity placement order and increase spacing to ensure free tiles.\n- Removing entities (e.g., picking up transport belt at 21.5, 73.5) to free space for inserters is a workaround but requires having the entity in inventory for replacement.\n\n### Inserter fuel and operation issues\n- Burner inserters and furnace repeatedly ran out of fuel causing stoppages. Ensure sufficient coal is inserted regularly to keep all burner entities operational.\n- Inserters showed statuses waiting for source items or waiting for space in destination, indicating bottlenecks in item flow. Monitor inventories and belt/chest capacities to maintain smooth throughput.\n\n### Item insertion errors due to empty inventory or undefined variables\n- Multiple exceptions occurred when trying to insert coal due to empty inventory despite prior harvesting. Verify inventory updates correctly after harvesting before attempting insertion.\n- NameError occurred due to referencing undefined variable `belt_to_chest_inserter`. Maintain consistent naming and initialization of inserter entities before use.\n\n### Inventory inspection errors on transport belts\n- Attempts to inspect inventory of transport belts failed with \"attempt to index a nil value\" error because transport belts do not have inventories. Avoid inspecting inventories on belts; inspect chests or inserters instead.\n\n### Entity placement failures due to missing items in inventory\n- Failure to place burner inserter at (21.5, 73.5) due to no burner inserter item in inventory. Keep track of inventory items required for placement to avoid such exceptions.\n\nNAMESPACE\nNo user-defined functions have been declared yet."}
