{"content": "# Factorio Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position(-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position (-15.0, -50.0)) which is currently out of fuel and has a drop position at (-14.5, -48.5) for iron ore.\n\n### Wooden Chest at position(-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest (position (-14.5, -48.5)) containing 357 iron ore.\n\n### Stone Furnace at position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position (0.0, 0.0)) which is currently out of ingredients and has a result inventory containing 49 iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items from inventory\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. In this case, the agent attempted to insert iron ore but had none available in inventory.\n\n### Errors related to fuel status\n- Check the fuel status of your mining drills and furnaces regularly. The burner mining drill is out of fuel, which prevents it from functioning. Ensure that you have sufficient fuel in your inventory to refuel these entities.\n\n### Errors when dealing with full chests\n- If a chest is full, items cannot be inserted into it. Make sure to empty the chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) to allow for continued mining operations.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the recent steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `current_inventory`: type `dict`, assigned value `{'wood': 6}`\n- `chest_inventory`: type `dict`, assigned value `{'iron-ore': 357}`\n- `furnace_status`: type `EntityStatus`, assigned value `EntityStatus.NO_INGREDIENTS`\n- `drill_status`: type `EntityStatus`, assigned value `EntityStatus.NO_FUEL`"}
