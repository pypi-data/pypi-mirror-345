Verify the positions and types of pipes being used.\n\n### Errors due to lack of fuel\n- Regularly check the fuel levels of boilers and other fuel-dependent entities to ensure continuous operation. Refuel them before they run out to avoid interruptions.\n\n### Errors due to missing fluid connections\n- Verify that all fluid connections are properly established between entities like boilers and steam engines. Check for any missing or incorrectly placed pipes that could disrupt fluid flow."}
