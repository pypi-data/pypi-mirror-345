{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES  \n\n#### Electricity Generator at position (x=-9.5, y=-0.5)  \n- **Offshore pump** at (x=-9.5, y=-0.5)  \n- **Boiler** at (x=-5.0, y=2.5)  \n- **Steam engine** at (x=0.5, y=6.5)  \n- **Small electric pole** at (x=3.5, y=6.5)  \n- Connected via pipes and power poles to form a functional electricity generation system.  \n\n#### Oil Extraction and Processing Facility at position (x=17.5, y=40.5)  \n- **Pumpjack** at (x=17.5, y=40.5) (producing crude oil)  \n- **Storage tank** at (x=22.5, y=44.5) (holding crude oil)  \n- **Oil refinery** at (x=29.5, y=48.5) (set to basic oil processing, but not operational due to fluid connection issues)  \n- **Petroleum gas storage tank** at (x=35.5, y=49.5) (empty)  \n- **Chemical plant** at (x=41.5, y=52.5) (set to plastic production, but missing coal and petroleum gas)  \n- Connected via pipes and power poles, but fluid connections are not fully functional.  \n\n### ERROR TIPS  \n\n#### Fluid Connection Issues  \n- **No valid connections between storage tank and refinery**  \n  - Ensure pipe connections align with input/output points (`oil_refinery.input_connection_points`).  \n  - Verify pipe continuity (no gaps or misaligned segments).  \n\n#### Refinery Not Processing Despite Fluid Presence  \n- **Fluid input misalignment**  \n  - Check if the refinery\u2019s input connection point (`x=30.5, y=51.5`) is correctly linked to the storage tank.  \n  - Use `connect_entities` with explicit waypoints if direct connection fails.  \n\n#### Empty Fluid Source Connections  \n- **Chemical plant cannot connect to empty source**  \n  - Ensure petroleum gas is produced and stored before connecting to the chemical plant.  \n  - Verify refinery output (`oil_refinery.output_connection_points`) is properly linked to storage.  \n\n#### Missing Ingredients in Production  \n- **Chemical plant requires coal and petroleum gas**  \n  - Ensure coal is available in the input inventory (`chemical_plant.assembling_machine_input`).  \n  - Confirm petroleum gas is being produced and piped correctly.  \n\n#### Power Supply Issues  \n- **Pumpjack and refinery require stable power**  \n  - Monitor power satisfaction (`entity.energy > 0`).  \n  - Expand electricity generation if needed (e.g., add more steam engines).  \n\n#### Incorrect Prototype Names  \n- Use `Prototype.PumpJack` (capital \"J\") instead of `Prototype.Pumpjack`.  \n\n#### Assertion Errors in Entity Checks  \n- Replace `entity.contents` with `entity.fluid_amount` for fluid checks.  \n- Example: `assert storage_tank.fluid_amount > 0, \"No fluid in tank\"`.  \n\n#### Recipe Not Set Before Connection  \n- Set recipes (`set_recipe`) before connecting pipes to avoid misalignment.  \n\n### NAMESPACE  \n*(No new functions defined by the agent in these steps.)*"}
