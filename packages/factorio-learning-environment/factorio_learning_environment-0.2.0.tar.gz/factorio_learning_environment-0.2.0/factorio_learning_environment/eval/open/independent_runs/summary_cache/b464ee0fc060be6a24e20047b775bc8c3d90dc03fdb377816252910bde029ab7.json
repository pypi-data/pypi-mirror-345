{"content": "# REPORT\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage System (around x=41, y=-83)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (x=41.0, y=-82.0) mining coal\n- Two iron chests for coal storage (x=41.5, y=-84.5 and x=41.5, y=-83.5)\n- Buffer wooden chest (x=41.5, y=-80.5) containing coal\n\n### Iron Smelting System (around x=46, y=-80)\nConsists of:\n- Two stone furnaces (x=45.0, y=-81.0 and x=47.0, y=-81.0)\n- Input wooden chest for iron ore (x=45.5, y=-79.5)\n- Two burner inserters:\n  - First inserter (x=44.5, y=-79.5) moving items between furnace and chest\n  - Second inserter (x=46.5, y=-79.5) moving items between furnace and chest\n- Output wooden chest for iron plates (x=49.5, y=-80.5)\n- Additional wooden chest (x=45.5, y=-84.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing inserters in occupied spaces\n- Before placing inserters, verify the target location is clear of other entities\n- Multiple attempts were made to place inserters at occupied positions (44.5,-80.5), (44.0,-80.5), (45.0,-80.0)\n- Consider checking entity collision boxes before placement\n\n### Entity placement near water or unplaceable terrain\n- Verify terrain is suitable for entity placement\n- Some attempts failed due to water or unplaceable terrain at (44.0,-80.5)\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Variables\n- first_ore_inserter: BurnerInserter\n- second_ore_inserter: BurnerInserter\n\n### System Status Variables\n- Mining drill fuel level: {'coal': 36}\n- Coal chest inventory: {'coal': 476}\n- Iron ore chest inventory: {'iron-ore': 27}\n- Furnace fuel levels: {'coal': 50}, {'coal': 49}\n\nThe system appears to be partially working but the furnaces are not receiving ingredients despite having fuel, suggesting potential issues with the inserter configuration or material flow."}
