{"content": "\"\"\"\nThe attempt to load stone into the active furnace has not resulted in the expected outcome:\n\n### Active Furnace Output Status:\n- The active furnace still lists **18 Iron Plates** and does not show any Copper Ore or stone, indicating that the stone insertion did not register properly.\n- The furnace remains in a **\"WORKING\"** status but is not processing any materials.\n\n### Overall Inventory Overview:\n- **Current Inventory**:\n  - 4 pieces of stone furnaces\n  - 7 pieces of coal remaining\n  - **4 pieces of stone** remaining (after attempted insertion)\n  - 5 pieces of iron ore\n  - **1 piece of copper ore** available.\n  - **3 pieces of iron plates** available.\n\n### Observations:\n- The furnace appears to be stuck in a state where it cannot accept the stone or process the Copper Ore, possibly due to an internal state issue.\n- The furnace's recipe still requires stone, and without it, it cannot smelt Copper Ore.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Extract Any Remaining Inputs**: I will extract any remaining inputs from the furnace to reset its state.\n2. **Reinsert Stone**: After clearing the furnace, I will attempt to load the required stone again.\n3. **Reinsert Copper Ore**: Finally, I will load the Copper Ore back into the furnace for smelting.\n\nLet\u2019s first extract any remaining inputs from the active furnace. \n\"\"\"\n\n# Extract any remaining inputs from the active furnace\nextract_item(Prototype.IronPlate, active_furnace, quantity=18)  # Extract all Iron Plates currently in the active furnace\n\n# Check the inventory status of the furnace after extraction\nactive_furnace_status_after_extraction = inspect_inventory(active_furnace)  # Inspect the status after extraction\noverall_inventory_after_extraction = inspect_inventory()  # Check total inventory after extraction.\n\nprint(f\"Active Furnace inventory status after extracting Iron Plates: {active_furnace_status_after_extraction}\")  # Status of the furnace after extraction.\nprint(f\"Overall current inventory after extracting Iron Plates: {overall_inventory_after_extraction}\")  # Total after operations.\nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")  # Review entities displayed on the map.", "summary_range": "[1-314]"}
