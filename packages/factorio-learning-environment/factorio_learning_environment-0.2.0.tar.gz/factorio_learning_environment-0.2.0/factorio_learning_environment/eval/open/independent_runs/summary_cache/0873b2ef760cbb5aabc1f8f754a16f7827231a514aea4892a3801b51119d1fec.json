{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) extracting iron ore, fueled with coal.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-15.5, -48.5) and (-14.5, -48.5) for temporary storage of extracted resources.\n- **Burner Inserters** at positions (-13.5, -48.5) and (-14.5, -47.5) for transferring resources between entities.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (-12.0, -48.0) and (-10.0, -48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates. The furnace at (-12.0, -48.0) is actively working, while the furnace at (-10.0, -48.0) is waiting for ingredients.\n- **Additional Wooden Chests** at positions (-14.5, -46.5), (-6.5, -49.5), (-6.5, -48.5), (-7.5, -48.5), (-5.5, -48.5), (-4.5, -48.5), (-3.5, -48.5), (-6.5, -47.5), and (-7.5, -47.5) for storing iron plates and other resources.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage and Distribution\n- **Wooden Chests** at various positions are used to store iron plates, with significant quantities at positions (-6.5, -49.5), (-6.5, -48.5), (-5.5, -48.5), and (-4.5, -48.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Extracting Items\n- Ensure that the target entity has the required items before attempting extraction. The agent encountered multiple extraction failures due to attempting to extract more items than available.\n\n### Inserter Blockage Issues\n- Regularly check and clear any blockages at inserter drop positions to ensure smooth operation. This was a recurring issue that halted the transfer of items between entities.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items."}
