{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=5.5, y=21.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=5.5, y=21.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=-1.5, y=24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and the steam engine\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\n- Furnace at position (x=10.0, y=0.0)\n- Furnace at position (x=13.0, y=0.0)\n- Furnace at position (x=16.0, y=0.0)\n- Inserters and wooden chests facilitating the movement of iron ore and plates\n\n### Lab at Position (x=2.5, y=0.5)\n- Connected to power with poles forming an electricity group with voltage 33\n\n### Storage and Transfer System\nConsists of:\n- Wooden chests at positions (x=8.5, y=-0.5), (x=17.5, y=-0.5), (x=19.5, y=-0.5), (x=20.5, y=-0.5)\n- Inserters at positions (x=8.5, y=0.5), (x=17.5, y=0.5), (x=19.5, y=0.5), (x=20.5, y=0.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Configuration\n- Ensure that inserters have a valid source and destination. Check the configuration to ensure they are connected to appropriate entities.\n\n### Errors in Crafting and Inventory Management\n- Ensure that you have the necessary raw materials in your inventory before attempting to craft items. Gather resources like wood manually if they are not available through recipes.\n\n### Errors in Power Connection\n- Verify that all power-requiring entities, such as labs, are properly connected to the power grid. Check the connections and ensure that poles are correctly placed to supply power.\n\n### Errors in Placing Entities\n- Before placing an entity, confirm that the required items are available in your inventory. If not, gather or craft the necessary items first.\n\n### Errors in Connecting Entities\n- When connecting entities like pipes, ensure that the connection is feasible and that the entities are compatible with each other. Use appropriate connectors like inserters for specific tasks."}
