{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nThis structure is designed to smelt iron ore into iron plates and transport them to a storage chest. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0) fueled by coal, currently working with 19 units of iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter 1** at position (1.5, 0.5) transferring iron plates from the furnace to a wooden chest at position (2.5, 0.5).\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (2.5, 0.5) storing iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter 2** at position (3.5, 0.5) extracting iron plates from the wooden chest and placing them onto a transport belt.\n- **Transport Belt** connecting positions (3.5, 0.5) to (5.5, 0.5) and (4.5, 0.5) to (6.5, 0.5), moving iron plates towards the end chest.\n- **Burner Inserter 3** at position (6.5, 0.5) transferring iron plates from the transport belt to the end wooden chest at position (7.5, 0.5).\n- **End Wooden Chest** at position (7.5, 0.5) collecting iron plates from the transport belt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied positions\n- Ensure that the target position for placing an entity is unoccupied. Consider adjusting the spacing or direction if the position is already occupied by another entity.\n\n### Errors when connecting belts directly from a chest\n- Use an inserter to extract items from a chest before attempting to connect them to a transport belt. Direct connections from a chest to a belt are not possible.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient inventory items\n- Before attempting to place or craft items, verify that you have the necessary resources in your inventory. For example, ensure you have enough wood to craft a wooden chest.\n\n### Errors when crafting without required raw resources\n- Gather necessary raw resources, such as wood, before attempting to craft items that require them. Recipes for raw resources do not exist and must be gathered manually.\n\n### Errors due to lack of source items for inserters\n- Ensure that the source entity has items available for the inserter to pick up. If an inserter is waiting for source items, check the inventory of the source entity."}
