{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nLocated at positions around x=-15.0, y=-50.0, this facility includes:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) responsible for extracting iron ore.\n- **Furnaces** at positions (x=-13.0, y=-48.0), (x=-11.0, y=-48.0), and (x=-9.0, y=-48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Chests** for storage of iron ore and iron plates, including positions (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) and (x=-13.5, y=-49.5).\n- **Burner Inserters** for transferring materials between entities.\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility\nLocated around x=41.0, y=-82.0, this facility includes:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0) for extracting coal.\n- **Furnace** at position (x=43.0, y=-82.0) for processing.\n- **Chests** at positions (x=41.5, y=-80.5), (x=42.5, y=-80.5), (x=44.5, y=-80.5), and (x=47.5, y=-80.5) for coal storage.\n- **Burner Inserters** for moving coal between entities.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Extracting Items\n- Ensure that the target entity (like a furnace or chest) contains the items you wish to extract. Verify the entity's inventory before attempting extraction.\n\n### Errors with Full Chests\n- Regularly check and clear chests that are full to prevent mining operations from halting. This is crucial for maintaining continuous production.\n\n### Errors with Missing Ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Regularly supply furnaces with the required raw materials to avoid production stoppages.\n\n### Errors with Refueling\n- Keep track of fuel levels in mining drills and inserters. Refuel them before they run out to maintain operational efficiency.\n\n### Errors with Entity Placement\n- Verify that the entity you wish to interact with exists at the specified position. Double-check coordinates and ensure the entity is not obstructed or missing."}
