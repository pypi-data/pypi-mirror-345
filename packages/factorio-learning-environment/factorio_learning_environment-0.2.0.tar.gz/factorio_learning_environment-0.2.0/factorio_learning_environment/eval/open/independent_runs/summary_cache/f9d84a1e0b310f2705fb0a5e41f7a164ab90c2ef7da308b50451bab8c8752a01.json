{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-18.5, 19.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position -18.5, 19.5), boiler (position -13.5, 20.0), and offshore pump (position -11.5, 26.5). The steam engine is connected to the electric pole at position (-16.5, 18.5).\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(-18, -49)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position -18.0, -49.0) and a furnace (position -18.0, -49.0)\n\n### Lab at position(-17.5, 23.5)\nConsists of the lab (position -17.5, 23.5).\n\n### Assembling machine factory at position(-21.5, 25.5)\nConsists of an assembling machine (position -21.5, 25.5) and an inserter that puts into the assembling machine.\n\n### Pipe groups\nConsists of multiple pipe groups for fluid transport:\n- PipeGroup (fluid_system=42656, position -18.5, 16.5)\n- PipeGroup (fluid_system=42659, position -12.5, 21.5)\n- PipeGroup (fluid_system=42660, position -8.5, 21.5)\n- PipeGroup (fluid_system=42662, position -10.5, 22.5)\n- PipeGroup (fluid_system=42663, position -7.5, 23.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using incorrect object attributes\n- Ensure to use the correct attributes for objects. For example, the 'Position' object does not have a 'position' attribute. Use the correct method to access the position.\n\n### Errors when steam engine is not generating power\n- Verify that the steam engine is properly connected to a power network and has the necessary input fluids. Ensure that the boiler is supplied with fuel and water to generate steam.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it. Check for existing entities in the target position.\n\n### Errors related to missing resources\n- Ensure that all necessary resources are available for production in the assembling machine. Check the recipe requirements and ensure that the inputs are present."}
