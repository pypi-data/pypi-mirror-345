{"content": "Based on the execution logs and entity data, here is the current report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Smelting Area (x=0-6, y=0-4)\nConsists of multiple furnaces for smelting iron:\n- Stone furnace at (0,0) with coal fuel\n- Stone furnace at (2,0) with coal fuel  \n- Stone furnace at (4,4) with coal fuel\n- Stone furnace at (6,4) with coal fuel\n\n### Inserter Assembly Line (x=20-27, y=2.5)\nAutomated inserter production line consisting of:\n- Input wooden chest at (26.5, 2.5)\n- Burner inserter at (25.5, 2.5) moving items from input chest to assembler\n- Assembling machine 1 at (23.5, 2.5) crafting inserters\n- Burner inserter at (21.5, 2.5) moving completed inserters\n- Output wooden chest at (20.5, 2.5) storing completed inserters (currently 140)\n\n### Power Generation System (x=-9.5 to 6.5, y=21-27)\nSteam power setup with:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, 24.5) extracting water\n- Pipe network connecting water flow\n- Boiler at (-2.5, 24) heating water into steam\n- Steam engine at (4.5, 24.5) generating power\n- Small electric poles at (2.5, 24.5) and (6.5, 24.5) distributing power\n\n### Research Lab Setup\nMultiple labs connected to electricity network (id 44076):\n- Several labs with automation and logistic science packs\n- Some labs currently without power\n- Electric pole network connecting labs and other powered entities\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Inventory Management Errors\n- Ensure required items are in inventory before attempting to insert into machines/chests\n- Check inventory has sufficient materials before attempting crafting operations\n\n### Power Issues\n- Some labs showing NO_POWER status - ensure consistent power distribution\n- Keep boiler fueled with coal to maintain steam engine operation\n\n### Assembly Line Issues\n- Assembler showing ITEM_INGREDIENT_SHORTAGE - ensure all required components (iron plate, iron gear wheel, electronic circuit) are available in input chest\n- Verify inserters have sufficient fuel to operate continuously\n\n### Crafting Errors\n- Cannot craft items requiring furnace processing (like iron plates) directly - must use furnace\n- Ensure all prerequisite materials are available before attempting to craft complex items"}
