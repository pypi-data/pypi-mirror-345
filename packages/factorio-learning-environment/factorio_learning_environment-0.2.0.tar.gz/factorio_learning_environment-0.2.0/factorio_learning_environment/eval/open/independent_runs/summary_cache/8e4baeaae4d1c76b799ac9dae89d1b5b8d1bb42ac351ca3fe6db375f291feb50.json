{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (46.0, -82.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace at position (46.0, -82.0) that converts iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden chest at position (47.5, -81.5) that collects the produced iron plates.\nUpdates:\n- Steps 38\u201340: Produced and had 2+2 iron plates extracted with fuel adjustments.\n- Step 42: After waiting 10 seconds, produced an additional 5 iron plates which were extracted.\n- Step 43: Received 10 iron ore to resume smelting.\n- Step 44: Waited an additional 10 seconds resulting in 5 new iron plates production that were extracted.\n- Step 45: Harvested 10 additional iron ore from a patch at position (-15.5, -50.5) and inserted them into the furnace at (46.0, -82.0) to resume smelting. Furnace state confirmed with an updated fuel count and processing details.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to insufficient resource availability and incorrect inventory checks\n- Verify resource presence in the inventory before inserting into an entity. Always confirm the expected resource (e.g., coal, iron ore) is available to avoid failures.\n\n### Errors related to timing in processing cycles and smelting timeouts\n- Allow sufficient processing time for smelting operations to complete. If additional iron plates are not produced within the expected period, adjust waiting periods or verify fuel and production settings.\n\n### Repeated mistakes with resource assertions\n- Check inventories and resource patches prior to operations to ensure the required amounts are accessible, thereby preventing assertion failures.\n\n### Errors from stale or incomplete entity data\n- Ensure entity references are up-to-date when reading the map state to avoid handling stale data."}
