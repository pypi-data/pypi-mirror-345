{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=20.5, y=-4.0)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (x=4.5, y=-10.5) and another at Position (x=19.5, y=-1.5)\n- Boiler at Position (x=20.5, y=-4.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (x=22.5, y=-7.5)\n- Pipe connections between the offshore pumps, boiler, and steam engine, including positions such as (x=20.5, y=-10.5), (x=21.5, y=-10.5), (x=22.5, y=-10.5), (x=20.5, y=-8.5), (x=20.5, y=-9.5), (x=20.5, y=-6.5), (x=20.5, y=-7.5), and (x=20.5, y=-5.5)\n- Small Electric Pole at Position (x=24.5, y=-7.5)\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0) and another at Position (x=2.0, y=0.0)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=5.0, y=5.0) for iron plate production\n\n### Pipe Network\n- PipeGroup for steam at Position (x=19.5, y=-12.5) with pipes connecting various positions\n- PipeGroup for water at Position (x=19.5, y=-2.5) with pipes connecting positions such as (x=18.5, y=-2.5) and (x=18.5, y=-3.5)\n\n### Electricity Network\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at positions including (x=25.5, y=-10.5), (x=18.5, y=-15.5), (x=23.5, y=-12.5), (x=21.5, y=-14.5), (x=16.5, y=-13.5), and (x=24.5, y=-7.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Insufficient Materials for Crafting\n- Ensure you have enough materials before attempting to craft items like Small Electric Poles. Gather necessary resources such as copper cables beforehand.\n\n### No Small Electric Poles Available\n- Maintain a stock of Small Electric Poles to ensure you can connect your power network efficiently. Regularly check your inventory and craft poles as needed.\n\n### Connection Issues with Offshore Pumps\n- Ensure that offshore pumps are properly connected to the fluid system. Check for any warnings such as \"No fluid present in connections\" and resolve them by verifying the pipe connections.\n\n### Lab Without Power\n- Ensure that the lab is connected to a power source. Check your electricity network for any disconnections or missing poles."}
