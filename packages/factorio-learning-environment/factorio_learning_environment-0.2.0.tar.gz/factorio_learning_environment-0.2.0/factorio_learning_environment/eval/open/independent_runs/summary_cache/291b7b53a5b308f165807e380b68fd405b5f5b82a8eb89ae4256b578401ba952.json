Raw resources must be gathered, not crafted.\n-  The agent attempted to craft `iron-plate` and `burner-mining-drill` directly. `iron-plate` must be smelted in a furnace, and `burner-mining-drill` requires `iron-gear-wheel` which also requires smelting. Ensure intermediate steps are done first.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into a furnace\n- The agent attempted to insert items into a furnace when it didn't have enough of those items in its inventory. Ensure sufficient items are in the inventory before attempting to insert.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions:\n\n### Variables:\n```python\nPrototype.Coal : Type[Item]\nPrototype.IronOre : Type[Item]\n```\n```\n"}
