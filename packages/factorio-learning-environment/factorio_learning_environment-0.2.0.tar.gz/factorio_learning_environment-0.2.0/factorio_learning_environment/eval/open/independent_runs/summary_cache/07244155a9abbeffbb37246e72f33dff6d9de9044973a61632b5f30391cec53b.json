For instance, 'extra_coal_storage' was not defined. Use the correct variable names as suggested by the error message.\n\n### Extraction Failures from Chests\n- Verify that the chest is not full and has space for the items you intend to extract. Ensure the inventory is not full or locked.\n\n### Transfer Failures to Furnaces\n- Ensure that the furnace has space for the items you are attempting to transfer. Check that the furnace is not full and is ready to receive new items."}
