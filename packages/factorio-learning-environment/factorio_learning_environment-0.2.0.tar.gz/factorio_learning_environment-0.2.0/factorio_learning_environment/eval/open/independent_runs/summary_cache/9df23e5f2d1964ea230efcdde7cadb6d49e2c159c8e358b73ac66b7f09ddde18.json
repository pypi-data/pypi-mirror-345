{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Complex (around x=-8, y=-59)\nConsists of:\n- Three burner mining drills at positions (-10.0, -59.0), (-8.0, -59.0), (-6.0, -59.0)\n- Three wooden chests at positions (-9.5, -57.5), (-7.5, -57.5), (-5.5, -57.5) collecting iron ore\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line (around x=3, y=0)\nConsists of:\n- Four stone furnaces at positions (0.0, 0.0), (2.0, 0.0), (4.0, 0.0), (6.0, 0.0)\n- Four input inserters at positions (0.5, -1.5), (2.5, -1.5), (4.5, -1.5), (6.5, -1.5)\n- Four output inserters at positions (0.5, 1.5), (2.5, 1.5), (4.5, 1.5), (6.5, 1.5)\n- Four input wooden chests at positions (0.5, -2.5), (2.5, -2.5), (4.5, -2.5), (6.5, -2.5) storing coal\n- Four output wooden chests at positions (0.5, 2.5), (2.5, 2.5), (4.5, 2.5), (6.5, 2.5) storing iron plates\n\n### Copper Processing Setup (around x=-27, y=-60)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at position (-28.0, -61.0)\n- Stone furnace at position (-27.0, -59.0)\n- Wooden chest at position (-24.5, -58.5)\n- Burner inserter at position (-25.5, -58.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Collision Errors\n- When placing inserters or other entities, ensure there is enough clear space without overlapping with existing entities\n- Check for proper spacing between entities, especially when placing inserters next to mining drills or furnaces\n- Consider the entity dimensions (some are 1x1 tiles, others are 2x2) when planning placement\n\n### Inserter Alignment Issues\n- Ensure inserters are properly aligned with their source and destination entities\n- Pay attention to the direction of inserters when placing them\n- Verify that inserters can reach both their pickup and drop positions\n\n### Mining Drill Output Blocking\n- Ensure there is a proper output collection system (chest, belt, or inserter) in place before starting mining operations\n- Clear any items on the ground that might be blocking mining drill outputs"}
