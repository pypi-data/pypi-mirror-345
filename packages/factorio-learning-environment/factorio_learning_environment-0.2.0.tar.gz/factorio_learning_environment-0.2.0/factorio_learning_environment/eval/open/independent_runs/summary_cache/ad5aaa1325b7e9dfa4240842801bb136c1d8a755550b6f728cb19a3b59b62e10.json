{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-10.5, 25.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-10.5, 25.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (-1.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe connections between these entities are not successfully established, causing the system to be non-functional.\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Furnace at Position (-19.0, -73.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5)\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) not receiving electricity.\n- Small Electric Poles around the inserter and furnaces, but the inserter is not powered.\n\n### Research Lab\nConsists of:\n- Lab with automation science packs but not receiving power.\n\n### Pipe Network\n- Multiple Pipe Groups at various positions, all empty and not successfully connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine.\n\n### Electricity Network\n- Multiple Electricity Groups with poles at various positions, but voltage is zero, indicating no power is being transmitted.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure that there are no blockages in the path of the pipes. Check for any misplaced entities that might be obstructing the connection.\n- Verify that all pipe connections are correctly aligned and that the pipes are placed on valid tiles.\n\n### Errors with Power Generation\n- Make sure that the offshore pump is correctly positioned on water and properly connected to the boiler.\n- Ensure that the boiler is fueled and that steam is being generated to power the steam engine.\n- Check the connections between the steam engine and the power network to ensure they are correctly established.\n\n### Inserter Not Receiving Power\n- Verify that the inserter is within the range of powered electric poles. Ensure that the electric poles are connected to a functional power source.\n\n### Lab Not Receiving Power\n- Ensure that the lab is connected to a powered electric network. Check the connections and ensure that the electric poles are transmitting power.\n\n### General Tip for Entity Placement\n- Before placing any entity, ensure the tile is not occupied by another entity to avoid placement errors."}
