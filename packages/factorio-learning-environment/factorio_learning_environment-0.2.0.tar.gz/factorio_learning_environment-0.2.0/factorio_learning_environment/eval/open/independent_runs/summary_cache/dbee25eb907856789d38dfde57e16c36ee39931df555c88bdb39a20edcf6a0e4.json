For example, the error occurred when attempting to get the lab at position (6.0, 0.0), which does not have a lab entity.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors related to power connections\n- Verify that all electric entities are properly connected to the electric network to avoid the NO_POWER status."}
