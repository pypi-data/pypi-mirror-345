{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-12.0, -48.0)\nThis structure is responsible for producing iron plates from iron ore and consists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0): Fueled by coal, currently working with a furnace source inventory containing iron ore and a furnace result inventory containing iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Inserts iron ore into the furnace from a wooden chest. The inserter is fueled by coal and is currently waiting for space in the destination.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-14.5, -47.5): Responsible for outputting iron plates from the furnace. The inserter is fueled by coal and is currently waiting for space in the destination.\n\n### Iron Ore Extraction and Storage\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and deposits it into a wooden chest. The drill is currently out of fuel.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore and iron plates.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-15.5, -48.5): Currently empty.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Extracting Items from a Non-Existent Entity\n- Ensure that the target entity (e.g., wooden chest) exists and contains the items you want to extract before attempting to extract items.\n\n### Errors when Inserting Items into a Full Inventory\n- Check the inventory capacity of the target entity (e.g., stone furnace) before inserting items to prevent overfilling.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Operations\n- Ensure that inserters have a clear path and destination to prevent them from waiting for space in the destination. Adjust inserter directions if necessary to avoid blockages.\n- Make sure there is a sink entity in place to accept the output from the inserter to prevent blockage by items on the ground."}
