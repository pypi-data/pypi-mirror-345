{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (17.5, 20.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (17.5, 20.5)\n- Boiler at position (1.5, 23.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the boiler and steam engine, including:\n  - Pipe at position (17.5, 17.5)\n  - Pipe-to-ground at position (16.5, 17.5)\n  - Extensive pipe network for steam and water distribution\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- Steam Pipe Network: Connects from boiler to steam engine, facilitating steam flow.\n- Water Pipe Network: Connects offshore pump to boiler, facilitating water flow.\n\n### Electricity Network\n- Electricity poles distributed across various positions, ensuring power distribution across the map.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure that the pipes are correctly aligned and within range to connect entities like boilers and steam engines. Check for any obstructions or incorrect placements that might prevent successful connections.\n\n### Errors when Using Extracting but Being Too Far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when Placing into a Tile Which is Occupied by Another Entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
