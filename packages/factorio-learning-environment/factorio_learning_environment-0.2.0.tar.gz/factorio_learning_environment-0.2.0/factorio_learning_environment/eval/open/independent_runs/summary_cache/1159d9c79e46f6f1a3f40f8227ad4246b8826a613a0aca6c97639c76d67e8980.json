{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Transfer System at Position (52.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (52.0, -82.0) extracting coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (53.5, -80.5) receiving coal from the drill.\n- Burner Inserter at position (52.5, -79.5) transferring coal from the chest at (53.5, -80.5) to another chest at (52.5, -78.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -78.5) storing coal.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing System at Position (-12.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-12.0, -51.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-11.5, -49.5) receiving iron ore from the drill.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) intended to smelt iron ore, but currently lacking ingredients.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-11.5, -48.5) waiting to transfer items from the chest at (-11.5, -49.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entities (e.g., chests or furnaces) contain items for inserters to transfer. Check for blockages or missing items in the supply chain.\n- Verify that the inserters are correctly positioned and oriented to pick up items from the intended source.\n\n### Chest Full Warning\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are part of the production line to prevent interruptions in resource extraction and processing.\n\n### Furnace Lacking Ingredients\n- Ensure that the furnaces have the necessary raw materials to process into finished goods. Verify that inserters are correctly supplying the furnace with required ingredients.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `current_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the current inventory of items such as 'wooden-chest', 'wood', 'coal', 'iron-ore', and 'iron-plate'."}
