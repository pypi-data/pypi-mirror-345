{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\u2022 Intended Lab Structure at (0.5, 2.5)\n\u2002\u2002\u2013 Use-case: Supply Automation Science Packs to advance research.\n\u2002\u2002\u2013 Note: Multiple placement attempts were made, but no Lab was successfully built due to inventory and resource shortages.\n\u2022 Production Facilities in Use (Pre\u2010existing)\n\u2002\u2002\u2013 Iron Smelting Facility at (5.0, 5.0)\n\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2022 Used to process iron ore into iron plates.\n\u2002\u2002\u2013 Copper Smelting Facility at (\u201327.0, \u201360.0)\n\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2002\u2022 Used to convert harvested copper ore into copper plates.\n\u2002\u2002\u2013 Note: These furnaces were retrieved from the map for smelting operations; they were not newly constructed by the agent.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 Incorrect API Usage for Entity Retrieval\n\u2002\u2002\u2013 When invoking get_entities, avoid unexpected keyword arguments (such as \u201cradius\u201d) and extra positional arguments. Verify the correct function signature against the API documentation.\n\u2022 Iterating Over a None Value\n\u2002\u2002\u2013 Always check that the value returned from an entity retrieval call is not None before iterating. Use an empty list as a safe fallback.\n\u2022 Lab Placement and Crafting Failures\n\u2002\u2002\u2013 Confirm that the Lab item is present in inventory before attempting to place it.\n\u2002\u2002\u2013 Ensure that all required sub-ingredients (e.g. iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, copper-cables) are available or can be produced beforehand.\n\u2002\u2002\u2013 Prioritize stable production (such as sufficient smelting of iron and copper plates) to meet the crafting demands of a Lab.\n"}
