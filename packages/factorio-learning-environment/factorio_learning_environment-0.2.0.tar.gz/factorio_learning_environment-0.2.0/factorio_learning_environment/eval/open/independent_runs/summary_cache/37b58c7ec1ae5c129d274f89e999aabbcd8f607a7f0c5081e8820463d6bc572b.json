{"content": "# Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\nAs of the current steps, there are no successfully placed structures on the map. All attempts to place entities such as wooden chests, stone furnaces, inserters, and transport belts have failed due to various errors, as indicated in the logs. Therefore, no structures can be reported at this time.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- **Cannot place Wooden Chest**: Ensure the target tile is unoccupied and suitable for placing a wooden chest. Check for collisions with existing entities or unsuitable terrain.\n- **Cannot place Stone Furnace**: Verify that the intended position for the stone furnace is clear of other entities and that the terrain supports placement.\n- **Cannot place Inserters (Ore and Plate)**: Ensure there is enough space and the correct orientation for inserters. Check for collisions with nearby entities or unsuitable terrain.\n- **Cannot place Transport Belts**: Confirm that the path for transport belts is clear and that the terrain allows for placement.\n\n### Errors during automation setup\n- **Name 'new_chest' is not defined**: This error indicates a missing or incorrect variable definition in the automation script. Ensure that all variables are correctly defined and initialized before use.\n- **Name 'ore_inserter' is not defined**: Similar to the above, ensure that all entities referenced in scripts are properly defined and initialized.\n\n### General Tips\n- Before placing any entity, verify that the target location is free of obstructions and that the terrain is suitable for the entity type.\n- Ensure all variables and entities used in scripts are correctly defined and initialized to avoid runtime errors.\n- Review the layout and spacing requirements for each entity to prevent placement errors due to collisions or unsuitable positioning."}
