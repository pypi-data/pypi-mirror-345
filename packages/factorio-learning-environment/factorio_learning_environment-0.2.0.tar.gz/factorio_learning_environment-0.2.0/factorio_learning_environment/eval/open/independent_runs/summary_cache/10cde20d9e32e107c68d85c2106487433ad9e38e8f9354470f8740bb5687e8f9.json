{"content": "Based on the execution logs, here is the updated report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining Setup at (41, -82)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0) facing DOWN\n- Wooden chest at (41.5, -80.5) storing coal\n- Burner inserter at (42.5, -80.5) facing RIGHT that moves coal from chest to belt\n- Transport belt at (43.5, -80.5) facing RIGHT\n\n### Smelting Setup at (46, -80)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace at (46.0, -80.0) facing UP\n- Burner inserter at (44.5, -80.5) facing RIGHT that feeds from belt to furnace\n- Connected to the transport belt from coal mining setup\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Rotation Issues\n- Some entities like stone furnaces cannot be rotated after placement. Place them with the correct initial orientation instead.\n\n### Entity Placement Collisions\n- Ensure placement locations are clear of items on ground and other entities\n- When placing entities that interact (like inserters and furnaces), verify the exact positions align with inserter drop/pickup points\n- Consider using proper spacing parameters when placing entities next to each other\n\n### Belt Blockage Issues\n- Clear transport belts of items before attempting to reconfigure connected structures\n- Belt blockages can cause upstream inserters to stop working - ensure smooth item flow\n\n### Fuel Management  \n- Mining drills require fuel to operate - monitor fuel levels\n- Even when furnaces have full fuel, they need ingredients to operate\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nImportant Variables:\n- furnace: Entity (stone-furnace)\n- belt: Entity (transport-belt) \n- inserter: Entity (burner-inserter)\n\nFunctions:\n- rotate_entity(entity, direction): Attempts to rotate an entity to specified direction\n- place_entity_next_to(entity, reference_entity, spacing, direction): Places an entity relative to another with given spacing and direction\n- clear_belt(): Removes items from transport belt segments"}
