{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (-1.5, 24.5)\n- Boiler at position (-5.5, 24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine, with key positions at (-9.5, 23.5), (-8.5, 23.5), and other intermediate positions.\n\n### Inserter and Storage System at Position (6.5, -60.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) connected to electricity group\n- Wooden Chest at position (7.5, -61.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (6.5, -59.5) containing 'iron-plate' and 'copper-plate'\n- Small Electric Poles at positions (5.5, -60.5), (7.5, -60.5), (5.5, -59.5), and (7.5, -59.5) providing power connectivity\n\n### Lab at Position (unknown)\n- Lab with input of 'automation-science-pack' but no research in progress\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Inventory Resources\n- Ensure that you have the necessary resources in your inventory before attempting to insert items into entities. For example, make sure coal is available before trying to insert it into a boiler.\n\n### Errors Related to Power Connectivity\n- Verify that all entities requiring electricity are properly connected to a power source. Ensure that the electricity network is complete and that there are no gaps in the connection.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Ingredients\n- Check that all production entities, such as furnaces, have the necessary ingredients to operate. Ensure that raw materials are supplied to these entities to prevent operation halts.\n\n### Errors Related to Entity Status\n- Regularly check the status of entities to ensure they are functioning as expected. Address any warnings or errors, such as \"no input liquid\" for steam engines, to maintain operational efficiency."}
