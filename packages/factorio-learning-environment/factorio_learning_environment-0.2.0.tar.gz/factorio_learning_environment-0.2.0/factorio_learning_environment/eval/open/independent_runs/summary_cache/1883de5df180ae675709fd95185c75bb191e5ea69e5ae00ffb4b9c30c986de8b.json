{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (52.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (52.0, -82.0) with a wooden chest at position (53.5, -80.5) for coal storage.\n- Burner Inserter at position (52.5, -79.5) transferring coal from the mining drill to a wooden chest at position (52.5, -78.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -78.5) storing coal, currently full.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-12.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-12.0, -51.0) with a stone furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) and a wooden chest at position (-11.5, -49.5) for iron ore storage.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-11.5, -48.5) transferring iron ore from the wooden chest to the stone furnace.\n\n### Miscellaneous Storage\n- Wooden Chest at position (0.5, 0.5) currently empty.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Manual Extraction Errors\n- Ensure that the entity you are trying to extract from is within reach and contains the items you intend to extract.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Check that the source entity is producing or has items available for the inserter to pick up. Ensure there are no blockages or missing items in the production line.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Space in Destination\n- Ensure that the destination entity (e.g., a chest) has space available to receive items from the inserter. If full, consider emptying or expanding storage capacity.\n\n### Output Blocked by Item on the Ground\n- Ensure that there is a clear path for items to move from the mining drill to the intended destination. Remove any items blocking the output path.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - No utility functions have been defined or invoked.\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the current inventory of items, including 'wooden-chest', 'wood', 'coal', 'iron-ore', and 'iron-plate'."}
