{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5) for coal storage.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Transport System at Position (-23.0, -68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-23.5, -69.5) for copper ore storage.\n- A series of Transport Belts forming a BeltGroup to transport copper ore from the mining drill to the chest.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Transport System at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -54.5) for iron ore storage.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5) transferring items from the chest to a transport belt.\n- A series of Transport Belts forming a BeltGroup to transport iron ore.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5) for storing coal, iron ore, and iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) transferring items between chests.\n\n### Additional Storage Facilities\n- Multiple Wooden Chests at various positions for storing different resources like iron ore, copper plate, and iron plate.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Stale Entity Data\n- Ensure that the entities you are interacting with are up-to-date and not stale. Refresh or re-fetch entity data before performing operations.\n\n### Attribute Errors with BeltGroup\n- Verify that the objects you are interacting with have the expected attributes. For instance, a BeltGroup does not have a 'prototype' attribute. Ensure you are using the correct object type for the operation.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Check that the source items are available and accessible to the inserter. Ensure that the inserter's pickup position is correctly aligned with the source of items.\n\n### Inserter Issues with Full Chests\n- Ensure that the destination chest has enough space to accommodate the items being transferred by the inserter. Regularly check and manage chest inventories to prevent them from becoming full."}
