Verify that there are no gaps or misalignments in the pipe network.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Fuel\n- Regularly check and replenish fuel in boilers and burner mining drills to maintain operation. Ensure that coal is available in your inventory before attempting to insert it into entities.\n\n### Errors Due to Missing Resources\n- Ensure that all required resources are available in your inventory before attempting to craft or insert them into machines. This includes checking for copper plates needed for copper cable production.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Electricity\n- Verify that all electrical entities are connected to a power source and that the electrical network is functioning. Ensure that small electric poles are placed correctly to provide power to inserters and assembling machines."}
