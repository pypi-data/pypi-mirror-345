{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) fueled with coal. This drill extracts iron ore and deposits it into a nearby chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5) and another at (-15.5, -48.5) used for storing extracted iron ore. The chest at (-14.5, -48.5) is currently full, causing a warning for the mining drill.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0) fueled with coal. This furnace is used for smelting iron ore into iron plates. Currently, it has a warning indicating \"no ingredients to smelt\".\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-14.5, -47.5) fueled with coal. This inserter is used to transfer items between chests.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing. Consider increasing the spacing, changing the direction, or changing the reference position if an entity already exists at the intended position.\n\n### Errors due to full storage\n- Regularly check and clear out full storage containers to prevent warnings and ensure continuous operation of mining drills and other production facilities.\n\n### Errors due to lack of ingredients\n- Ensure that the furnace has the necessary ingredients to smelt by regularly supplying it with iron ore."}
