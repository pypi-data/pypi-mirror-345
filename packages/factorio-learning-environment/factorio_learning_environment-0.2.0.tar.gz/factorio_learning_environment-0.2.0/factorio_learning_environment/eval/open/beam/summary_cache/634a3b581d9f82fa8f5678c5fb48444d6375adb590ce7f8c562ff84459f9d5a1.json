{"content": "The attempt to harvest iron ore resulted in an error stating that there was \"Nothing within reach to harvest.\" This indicates that either the iron ore patch is depleted or the position specified is not valid for harvesting.\n\n### Tips to Avoid This Error in the Future:\n\n1. **Check Resource Availability**: Before attempting to harvest, ensure that the resource patch has not been depleted. You can use a function to check the status of the resource patch.\n\n2. **Verify Position**: Ensure that the position you are trying to harvest from is indeed where the resource is located. You can use `nearest(Resource.IronOre)` to find the closest available patch.\n\n3. **Use Resource Patches**: Utilize functions like `get_resource_patch(Resource.IronOre, nearest(Resource.IronOre))` to confirm the existence and quantity of the resource before harvesting.\n\n4. **Adjust Harvesting Quantity**: If you suspect the resource patch might be low, consider harvesting a smaller quantity first to confirm availability.\n\n5. **Movement Confirmation**: After moving to a resource location, confirm that you are in the correct position before attempting to harvest.\n\n### Next Steps:\n\n1. Use a function to check the nearest iron ore patch and its status.\n2. If available, attempt to harvest again, ensuring the position is correct.", "summary_range": "[1-36]"}
