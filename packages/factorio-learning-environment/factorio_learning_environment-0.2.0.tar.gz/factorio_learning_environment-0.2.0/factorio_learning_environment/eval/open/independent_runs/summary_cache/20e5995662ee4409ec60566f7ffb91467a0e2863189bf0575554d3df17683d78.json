{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0) with a drop position at (x=-16.5, y=-52.5), currently working but output blocked due to items on the ground.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0), currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied locations\n- Ensure the desired location is free of other entities or items before placing a new entity. This includes checking for items on the ground that might block placement.\n\n### Errors when moving entities to a new location\n- Verify that the target location for moving an entity is unoccupied and suitable for the entity type before attempting to move it.\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities at specific positions\n- Confirm that the entity exists at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it. Double-check the coordinates and ensure the entity type matches expectations.\n\n### Errors with blocked output\n- Ensure there is a sink entity (e.g., a chest or another processing unit) to accept output from production entities like drills or furnaces to prevent blockage.\n\n### Errors with missing ingredients\n- Make sure that all necessary ingredients are available in the required quantities for production entities to function effectively."}
