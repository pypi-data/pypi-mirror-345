{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\nThis structure is responsible for generating electricity and consists of the following entities:\n- **Steam Engine** at position (x=17.5, y=20.5) with warnings of 'no input liquid' and 'no fluid present in connections', indicating it is not currently operational.\n- **Boiler** at position (x=1.5, y=23.0) with a warning of 'out of fuel', indicating it needs fuel to operate.\n- **Offshore Pump** at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5) which is operational and supplying water to the system.\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- **PipeGroup (fluid_system=24307)** at position (x=9.5, y=15.5), currently empty, connecting various points including (x=9.5, y=15.5) to (x=2.5, y=21.5).\n- **PipeGroup (fluid_system=24317)** at position (x=6.5, y=21.5), also empty, connecting points (x=6.5, y=21.5) to (x=10.5, y=21.5).\n- **PipeGroup (fluid_system=24319)** at position (x=-9.5, y=23.5), full of water, connecting points (x=-9.5, y=23.5) to (x=-0.5, y=23.5).\n\n### Electricity Network\n- **ElectricityGroup (id=44925)** with poles at various positions including (x=10.5, y=13.5), (x=1.5, y=14.5), and (x=-2.5, y=17.5), but currently has a voltage of 0, indicating no power is being distributed.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure that pipes and underground pipes are correctly aligned and connected to their intended targets. The failure to connect pipes from position (x=1.5, y=21.5) to the steam engine at position (x=17.5, y=20.5) suggests a misalignment or incorrect connection attempt. Verify that the path is clear and connections are valid.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Fuel\n- The boiler at position (x=1.5, y=23.0) is out of fuel. Regularly check fuel levels and ensure that all fuel-dependent entities are supplied with the necessary resources to function.\n\n### Warnings of No Input Liquid\n- The steam engine at position (x=17.5, y=20.5) has warnings of 'no input liquid'. Ensure that the connected pipes are supplying the necessary fluids, such as water, to the steam engine to enable operation.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- **connect_entities**: This function attempts to connect entities such as pipes and underground pipes. It failed when trying to connect from position (x=1.5, y=21.5) to the steam engine at position (x=17.5, y=20.5), indicating a potential issue with the path or connection logic.\n\n### Important Variables\n- **pipes**: A collection of connected pipe entities, which failed to establish a connection in the recent steps.\n- **fluid_system**: Represents different fluid networks, such as 24307, 24317, and 24319, each with varying statuses and contents."}
