{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Storage and Transfer System at Position (41.5, -80.5)\n- **Wooden Chest** at Position (41.5, -80.5) with empty inventory.\n- **Wooden Chest** at Position (43.5, -80.5) containing 39 coal.\n- **Burner Inserter** at Position (42.5, -80.5) transferring items between the two chests, currently waiting for source items.\n\n#### Iron Smelting Setup at Position (52.0, -79.0)\n- **Stone Furnace** at Position (52.0, -79.0) with 26 coal, currently idle due to no ingredients.\n- **Burner Inserter** at Position (53.5, -79.5) out of fuel, intended to transfer items to the furnace.\n- **Wooden Chest** at Position (54.5, -79.5) containing 336 iron plates.\n\n#### Iron Plate Storage at Position (56.5, -78.5)\n- **Burner Inserter** at Position (55.5, -78.5) waiting for source items to transfer to the chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at Position (56.5, -78.5) with empty inventory.\n\n#### Iron Ore Mining Setup at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at Position (-15.0, -50.0) out of fuel, with a full chest at the drop position.\n- **Wooden Chest** at Position (-14.5, -48.5) with empty inventory.\n- **Burner Inserter** at Position (-13.5, -48.5) waiting for source items to transfer from the mining drill to the chest.\n\n#### Central Storage at Position (0.5, 0.5)\n- **Wooden Chest** at Position (0.5, 0.5) containing various items including coal, iron ore, iron plates, and iron gear wheels.\n- **Wooden Chest** at Position (1.5, 0.5) containing coal, iron ore, and other items.\n- **Wooden Chest** at Position (2.5, 0.5) containing 162 coal.\n- **Wooden Chest** at Position (3.5, 0.5) containing 325 coal.\n- **Wooden Chest** at Position (4.5, 0.5) containing coal and iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chest** at Position (5.5, 0.5) containing iron ore, iron plates, and iron gear wheels.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Issues with Fuel Management\n- **Burner Inserter at Position (53.5, -79.5)** is out of fuel. Ensure all burner inserters have sufficient coal to operate.\n- **Burner Mining Drill at Position (-15.0, -50.0)** is out of fuel. Regularly check and refuel mining drills to maintain production.\n\n#### Chest Full Errors\n- **Burner Mining Drill at Position (-15.0, -50.0)** is unable to drop items because the chest at Position (-14.5, -48.5) is full. Empty the chest to allow the mining drill to continue operation.\n\n#### Waiting for Source Items\n- **Burner Inserter at Position (42.5, -80.5)** is waiting for source items. Ensure the source chest has items to transfer.\n- **Burner Inserter at Position (55.5, -78.5)** is waiting for source items. Verify the source chest has items available for transfer.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n#### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked by the agent in the provided logs.\n\n#### Important Variables\n- No important variables have been assigned in the provided logs."}
