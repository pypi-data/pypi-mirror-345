{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Electricity Generator at (x=-3.0, y=2.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump (x=-9.5, y=-0.5)\n- Boiler (x=-3.0, y=2.5)\n- Steam engine (x=0.5, y=2.5)\nConnected by pipes and power poles\n\n#### Oil Processing Facility\n1. Crude Oil Extraction:\n   - Pumpjack (x=17.5, y=40.5)\n   - Connected to crude oil input tank (x=4.5, y=15.5)\n\n2. Oil Refinery:\n   - Oil refinery (x=9.5, y=15.5) set to Basic Oil Processing\n   - Connected to:\n     - Crude oil input tank (x=4.5, y=15.5)\n     - Petroleum gas output tank (x=14.5, y=15.5) [currently missing]\n\n3. Chemical Processing:\n   - Chemical plant (x=2.5, y=8.5) set to Sulfur recipe\n   - Petroleum gas input tank (x=-1.5, y=8.5) [currently missing]\n   - Sulfur output tank (x=6.5, y=8.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Fluid Connection Issues\n- Cannot connect chemical plants without first having the correct input fluid available (chemical plant expected petroleum gas but got crude oil)\n- Verify fluid types match between connected entities before making connections\n- Check fluid requirements of recipes before making connections\n\n#### Entity Placement Errors\n- Cannot place storage-tank at (14.5, 15.5) - position may be in water or blocked\n- Move closer to target position before placing entities (max placement distance is 10 tiles)\n- Verify target position is clear before attempting placement\n\n#### Power Management\n- Pumpjack stopped working due to NO_POWER status\n- Ensure all electric entities are properly connected to power poles\n- Monitor power production/consumption balance\n\n#### Entity Status Checks\n- Refinery has FLUID_INGREDIENT_SHORTAGE - verify input connections and fluid availability\n- Always check entity status before operations (WORKING vs other states)\n- Storage tanks don't have .contents attribute - use appropriate methods to check fluids\n\n#### Pipe Connection Problems\n- Boiler to steam engine connection failed - verify connection points aren't blocked\n- When reconnecting pipes, ensure both source and target connection points are accessible\n- Remove old pipes completely before attempting new connections\n\n#### General Tips\n- Always check recipe requirements before setting up production chains\n- Monitor entity status indicators to detect production issues\n- Verify fluid systems are properly connected end-to-end before expecting production"}
