{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Coal Mining and Smelting Setup at position (41.0, -86.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner mining drills** at positions (41.0, -86.0) and (43.0, -86.0) for coal extraction.\n- **Wooden chests** at positions (43.5, -84.5) and (41.5, -82.5) for storing coal.\n- **Burner inserters** at positions (41.5, -83.5) and (43.5, -80.5) for transferring coal.\n- **Stone furnace** at position (43.0, -79.0) for smelting.\n\n#### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Setup at position (-17.0, -52.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner mining drill** at position (-17.0, -52.0) for iron ore extraction.\n- **Wooden chest** at position (-16.5, -50.5) for storing iron ore.\n- **Burner inserters** at positions (-17.5, -50.5) and (-14.5, -52.5) for transferring iron ore.\n- **Stone furnaces** at positions (-15.0, -51.0) and (-13.0, -50.0) for smelting.\n\n#### Smelting Storage Setup at position (-14.5, -47.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Wooden chest** at position (-14.5, -47.5) for storing smelted items.\n- **Burner inserter** at position (-14.5, -48.5) for transferring items into the chest.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when placing entities in occupied tiles\n- Ensure the target tile is free before placing an entity. If the tile is occupied, increase spacing, change direction, or adjust the reference position.\n\n#### Errors when connecting entities with transport belts\n- Verify that the positions for transport belts are free and correctly aligned between the source and destination entities.\n\n#### Errors when retrieving entities that do not exist\n- Always check if the entity exists at the specified position before attempting to retrieve or interact with it.\n\n#### Repeated errors in entity placement and retrieval\n- Consistently verify entity positions and ensure that the placement logic accounts for existing entities to avoid repeated errors.\n\n#### Errors due to full chests\n- Regularly empty chests that are full to allow mining and smelting operations to continue without interruptions."}
