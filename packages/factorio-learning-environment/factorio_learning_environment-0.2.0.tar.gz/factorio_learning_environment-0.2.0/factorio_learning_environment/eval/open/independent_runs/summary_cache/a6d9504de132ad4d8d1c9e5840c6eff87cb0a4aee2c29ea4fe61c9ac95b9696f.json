{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Furnace at position (0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position (0, 0)) with fuel (coal) and currently smelting copper plates. The furnace has a status of NO_INGREDIENTS due to lack of raw materials.\n\n### Chest at position (2.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest (position (2.5, 0.5)) containing 116 copper plates.\n\n### Copper Plate Production Line\nThis structure is formed by the interaction of the furnace and the chest:\n- The stone furnace at position (0, 0) is connected to the wooden chest at position (2.5, 0.5) for transferring copper plates.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n- **Errors when transferring items but inventory is full**: Ensure that the player's inventory has enough space before transferring items from the chest.\n- **Errors when attempting to craft without sufficient resources**: Always check the inventory for required materials before attempting to craft items. In this case, the agent lacks the necessary resources to craft the Automation Science Pack.\n- **Errors when furnace has no ingredients**: Make sure to provide the necessary raw materials to the furnace to avoid it being in a NO_INGREDIENTS state.\n  \n### NAMESPACE\n- **Utility Functions**: \n  - `transfer_items(source, destination, amount)`: Successfully invoked to transfer copper plates from the chest to the player's inventory. However, it failed multiple times due to insufficient space in the player's inventory.\n  \n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `copper_plate_count: int = 116`\n  - `player_inventory: dict = {'stone-furnace': 1, 'wood': 6, 'iron-plate': 48, 'automation-science-pack': 61}`\n  - `furnace_inventory: dict = {'copper-plate': 100}`\n  - `chest_inventory: dict = {'copper-plate': 116}`"}
