{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-16.0, -51.0)\n  - Fuel: 4 units of coal\n  - Status: Working\n  - Warnings: Output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Neighbours: Connected to a stone furnace\n  - Drop Position: (-16.5, -52.5)\n  - Resources: 40,000 units of iron ore\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-14.0, -49.0)\n  - Fuel: 14 units of coal\n  - Status: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Furnace Result: 60 iron plates\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied or invalid locations\n- Ensure the target location is free before attempting to place entities such as Burner Inserter, Transport Belt, Wooden Chest, and Stone Furnace. Check for existing entities or obstructions.\n\n### Errors when moving entities to invalid locations\n- Verify the destination is valid and unoccupied before moving entities like Stone Furnace to avoid errors related to invalid positions.\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities from invalid positions\n- Ensure the entity exists at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it. This will prevent errors related to non-existent entities.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient inventory items\n- Maintain adequate inventory levels for items like coal to avoid errors when inserting items into entities such as drills.\n\n### Errors due to blocked outputs\n- Ensure there is a sink entity in place to accept the output from entities like Burner Mining Drills to prevent blockage warnings and ensure continuous operation."}
