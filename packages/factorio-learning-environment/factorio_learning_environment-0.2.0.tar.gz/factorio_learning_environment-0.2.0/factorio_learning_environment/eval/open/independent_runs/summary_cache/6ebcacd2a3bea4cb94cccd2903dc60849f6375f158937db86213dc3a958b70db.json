{"content": "## Report\n\n### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Electricity Generator at Position (-0.5, 17.5)\n- Consists of:\n  - Steam Engine at position (-0.5, 17.5)\n  - Boiler at position (-3.5, 22.0)\n  - Offshore Pump at position (-7.5, 25.5)\n  - Connected pipes at positions (-2.5, 20.5), (-3.5, 20.5), (-0.5, 20.5), (-1.5, 20.5)\n\n#### Copper Plate Mine at Position (-28.0, -61.0)\n- Consists of:\n  - Burner Mining Drill at position (-28.0, -61.0)\n  - Wooden Chest at position (-27.5, -59.5) for collecting mined copper ore\n\n#### Iron Plate Production Line\n- Consists of:\n  - Multiple Stone Furnaces at positions (0.0, 0.0), (10.0, 0.0), (13.0, 0.0), (16.0, 0.0)\n  - Burner Inserters connected to chests and furnaces for automated material handling\n\n#### Lab for Research at Position (2.5, 0.5)\n- Lab connected to power and set for Automation research\n- Currently missing science packs for research progression\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors Due to Insufficient Inventory\n- Ensure sufficient resources are in the inventory before attempting to craft or insert items. For instance, copper cables and automation science packs need to be available in required quantities.\n\n#### Errors in Placing Entities\n- Ensure the entity is available in the inventory before attempting to place it. For example, Assembling Machine 1 was attempted to be placed without having it in the inventory.\n\n#### Errors in Crafting Due to Locked Recipes\n- Research necessary technologies before attempting to craft items that require them. For example, the recipe for Assembling Machine 1 requires automation technology to be researched first.\n\n#### Errors When Inserting Items into Full Inventories\n- Check the inventory capacity of entities like furnaces before inserting items to avoid failed insertions.\n\n#### Errors When Entities are Too Far\n- Move closer to the target position before attempting to place or interact with entities to avoid distance-related errors.\n\n#### Errors in Extracting Resources\n- Ensure that the target entity contains the resources before attempting extraction to avoid extraction errors.\n\n#### Errors in Research Progression\n- Ensure that the lab is supplied with the required science packs to progress in research."}
