{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Production at Position (-20.0, -70.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -70.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-18.0, -70.0)\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Transport System at Position (-23.0, -68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (-23.5, -69.5)\n- Transport Belts connecting the mining drill to the chest\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -54.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (-12.5, -54.5)\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Production and Storage at Position (-21.0, -62.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-21.0, -62.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (-20.5, -63.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Production and Storage at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (3.5, 0.5)\n- Burner Inserter at position (2.5, 0.5)\n\n### Belt Systems\n- Multiple Belt Groups connecting various entities across the map, facilitating the transport of resources between mining drills, furnaces, and chests.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Belt Connectivity\n- Ensure continuous placement of belts without gaps to maintain connectivity. A gap was detected at position (-20.5, -67.5) which caused connectivity issues. Always verify belt placement to avoid such gaps.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entity has items available for the inserter to pick up. If an inserter is waiting for source items, check the upstream supply chain for blockages or shortages.\n\n### Out of Fuel for Mining Drills\n- Regularly check and refuel mining drills to prevent them from running out of fuel. A mining drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) was out of fuel, which halted its operation."}
