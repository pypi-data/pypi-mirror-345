{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Plate Smelting Setup at Position (x=-26.0, y=-61.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-26.0, y=-61.0)\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-27.5, y=-62.5) that transfers items from the chest to the furnace\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-28.5, y=-62.5) for storing coal and other items\n\n#### Copper Ore Mining Setup at Position (x=-28.0, y=-61.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-28.0, y=-61.0) for mining copper ore\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-27.5, y=-59.5) for storing mined copper ore\n\n#### Iron Ore Mining Setup at Position (x=2.0, y=-63.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=2.0, y=-63.0) for mining iron ore\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=4.0, y=-63.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=3.5, y=-61.5) that transfers items from the chest to the furnace\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=2.5, y=-61.5) for storing iron ore\n\n#### Additional Furnaces at Position (x=6.0, y=-63.0) and (x=8.0, y=-63.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=6.0, y=-63.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=8.0, y=-63.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when attempting to craft items without a crafting machine or furnace\n- Ensure that you use a crafting machine or furnace to craft items like iron plates. Direct crafting is not possible for these items.\n\n#### Errors when extracting items from a chest\n- Verify that the chest contains the items you are trying to extract. If the chest is empty or does not contain the specified item, extraction will fail.\n\n#### Errors due to lack of fuel in mining drills and furnaces\n- Always ensure that mining drills and furnaces are fueled with coal or another fuel source to keep them operational.\n\n#### Errors due to full chests at drop positions\n- Regularly empty chests at the drop positions of mining drills to prevent them from stopping due to full storage.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n#### Utility Functions\n- **craft_item(Prototype, quantity)**: Attempts to craft a specified quantity of an item. Fails if the item requires a crafting machine or furnace.\n- **extract_item(Prototype, chest, quantity)**: Attempts to extract a specified quantity of an item from a chest. Fails if the chest does not contain the item.\n\n#### Important Variables\n- **crafted_plates**: Variable intended to store the result of crafting iron plates.\n- **extracted_copper_ore**: Variable intended to store the result of extracting copper ore from a chest."}
