Ensure the player is positioned sufficiently close before attempting placement.\n\u2003\u2013 Repeated placement attempts\u2014whether using direct buildable area checks or trying to position the engine adjacent to the Boiler\u2014have failed due to obstructed or non-buildable candidate positions. Validate potential positions for collisions with nearby entities (transport belts, water, lab, electric poles, pipes, etc.) before placement.\n\u2003\u2013 Adjustments in spacing (from 0 up to 3) did not yield an unobstructed tile; reconsider the reference position or temporarily relocate conflicting entities to enable successful repositioning.\n\n\u2022 BURNER INSERTER FUEL MANAGEMENT:\n\u2003\u2013 Monitor and adjust fuel distribution across burner inserters to mitigate low fuel or \u201cout of fuel\u201d warnings.\n\n\u2022 TILE PLACEMENT & OCCUPANCY:\n\u2003\u2013 Pre\u2010validate target tile availability to avoid occupancy errors; ensure that target positions are free of obstacles before placing an entity.\n\n\u2022 TYPE HANDLING:\n\u2003\u2013 Avoid calling non\u2010callable objects (such as Position) as functions; access attributes directly to prevent TypeErrors.\n\n\u2022 GLOBAL SYSTEM CONFIGURATION:\n\u2003\u2013 Address persistent issues in power distribution and fluid connectivity by aligning overall system configurations and verifying unobstructed connection points."}
