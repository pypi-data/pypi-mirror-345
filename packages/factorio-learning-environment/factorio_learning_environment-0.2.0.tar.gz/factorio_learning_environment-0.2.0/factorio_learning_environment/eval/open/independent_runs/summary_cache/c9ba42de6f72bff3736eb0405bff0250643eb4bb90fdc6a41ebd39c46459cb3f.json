{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (5.5, 21.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (5.5, 21.5)\n- Boiler at position (-1.5, 24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe connections between the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine\n- Small Electric Poles connecting the steam engine to other entities\n\n### Lab at Position (2.5, 0.5)\n- Lab is currently working on Automation research\n- Connected to the electricity network\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Uses coal as fuel, currently has no ingredients to smelt\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Insufficient Resources for Crafting\n- Ensure you have enough resources in your inventory before attempting to craft items. For example, copper plates and copper cables are needed for crafting copper cables and small electric poles, respectively.\n\n### Errors in Entity Connection\n- Verify that you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to connect entities, such as pipes and electric poles.\n- Ensure that entities are correctly aligned and within range for connections, especially when connecting pipes and electric poles.\n\n### Undefined Variables\n- Double-check your code for any undefined variables or incorrect variable names. Use the correct variable names as defined in your codebase.\n\n### Lab Entity Errors\n- Ensure that the lab entity is correctly identified and available on the map before attempting to interact with it.\n\n### Steam Engine Not Working\n- Make sure that the steam engine is properly connected to both the boiler and the electricity network. Check that all necessary connections are in place and that the boiler is fueled.\n\n### Inventory Management\n- Regularly check your inventory to ensure you have sufficient resources for your tasks, such as coal for refueling boilers and materials for crafting.\n\nBy following these tips, you can mitigate common errors and improve the efficiency of your operations in the game."}
