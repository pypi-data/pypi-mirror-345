{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Stone Furnace Smelting Setup at position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of:\n\u2022 Stone Furnace at position (41.0, -82.0) that processes ores.\n\u2022 Burner Inserter at position (41.5, -83.5) transferring output from the furnace.\n\u2022 Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -84.5) storing processed items.\n\u2022 Wooden Chest at position (42.5, -81.5) serving as additional storage.\n\n### Lab Setup at position (45.5, -79.5)\nConsists of:\n\u2022 Lab at position (45.5, -79.5) receiving automation science packs, engaged in automation research.\n\n### Boiler and Steam Engine Production Setup\nConsists of:\n\u2022 Boiler at position (42.5, -79.0) fueled with wood, intended for steam production but flagged with warnings (no input liquid, no fluid present in connections). It has connection points at positions (40.5, -78.5) and (44.5, -78.5) and a steam output point at (42.5, -81.0).\n\u2022 Steam Engine crafted and present in inventory. An attempted placement of a steam engine at position (44.0, -79.5) failed due to an obstruction at the target location.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 Insufficient sub-ingredients for crafting \u2013 Repeated failures in crafting automation science packs and steam engines stem from missing sub-ingredients (iron-plate and iron-gear-wheel). Ensure adequate supply of necessary intermediate products and that the smelting or crafting facilities are properly configured.\n\u2022 Incorrect placement locations \u2013 The error encountered when attempting to place a steam engine indicates target tile obstruction. Validate that the target location is free of other entities before placement.\n\u2022 Handling inventory and placement mismatches \u2013 Continue to double-check inventory contents and the availability of required items before initiating insertions or placements, as seen with multiple extraction and insertion operations requiring precision."}
