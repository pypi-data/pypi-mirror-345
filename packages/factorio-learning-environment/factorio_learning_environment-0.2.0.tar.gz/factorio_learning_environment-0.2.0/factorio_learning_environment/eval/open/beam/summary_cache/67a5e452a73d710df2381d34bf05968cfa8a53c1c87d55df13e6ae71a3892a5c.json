{"content": "Ah, I see the issue. We need to check the inventory using the actual string name of the item, not the Prototype enum. Let's fix this:\n\n```python\n# Check current inventory\ncurrent_inventory = inspect_inventory()\nprint(f\"Current inventory: {current_inventory}\")\n\n# Check if we need to craft a stone furnace\nif 'stone-furnace' not in current_inventory:\n    # Craft stone furnace\n    craft_item(Prototype.StoneFurnace)\n    print(\"Crafted stone furnace\")\n\n# Verify we now have the furnace\ncurrent_inventory = inspect_inventory()\nprint(f\"Updated inventory: {current_inventory}\")\nassert 'stone-furnace' in current_inventory, \"Failed to craft stone furnace\"\n\n# Now place the furnace\nmove_to(Position(x=-10.0, y=29.0))\nfurnace = place_entity(\n    Prototype.StoneFurnace,\n    position=Position(x=-10.0, y=29.0),\n    direction=Direction.UP,\n    exact=True\n)\n\n# Add fuel to furnace\nif furnace:\n    insert_item(Prototype.Coal, furnace, quantity=5)\n    print(f\"Successfully placed and fueled furnace at {furnace.position}\")\n\n    # Now place inserter\n    move_to(Position(x=-10.5, y=28.5))\n    inserter = place_entity(\n        Prototype.BurnerInserter,\n        position=Position(x=-10.5, y=28.5),\n        direction=Direction.RIGHT,\n        exact=True\n    )\n    \n    if inserter:\n        # Add fuel to inserter\n        insert_item(Prototype.Coal, inserter, quantity=5)\n        print(f\"Successfully placed and fueled inserter at {inserter.position}\")\n\n# Verify final setup\nprint(f\"Final entity setup: {get_entities()}\")\n```\n\nThis version should work better because:\n1. We check for 'stone-furnace' in the inventory using the string name\n2. We craft the furnace if we don't have it\n3. We verify the craft was successful before proceeding\n4. We then place and fuel both the furnace and inserter", "summary_range": "[1-560]"}
