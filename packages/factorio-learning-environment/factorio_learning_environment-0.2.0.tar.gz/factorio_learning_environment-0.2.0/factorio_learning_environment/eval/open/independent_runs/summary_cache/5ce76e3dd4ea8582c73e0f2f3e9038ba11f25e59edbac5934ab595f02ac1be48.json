The drill is currently out of fuel.\n- The wooden chest at position (41.5, -80.5) is full. Empty the chest to allow the burner mining drill to continue mining.\n\n### Errors when inserting into the furnace\n- Ensure that the furnace has the necessary ingredients to smelt. The furnace at position (-15.0, -50.0) is currently showing no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Errors when extracting from the wooden chest\n- Make sure to monitor the inventory of the wooden chest to avoid attempting to extract more resources than are available. The chest currently contains only 1 coal.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the current execution steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `wood`: int\n- `coal`: int\n- `iron-ore`: int\n- `iron-plate`: int"}
