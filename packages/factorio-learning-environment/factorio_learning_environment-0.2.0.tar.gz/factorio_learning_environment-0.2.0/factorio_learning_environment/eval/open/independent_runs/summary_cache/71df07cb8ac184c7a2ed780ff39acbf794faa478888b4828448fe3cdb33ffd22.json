{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Boiler** at position (-5.5, 24.0) with no fuel.\n- **Steam Engine** at position (-1.5, 24.5) not connected to the power network.\n- **Offshore Pump** at position (-9.5, 24.5) supplying water.\n- **Pipe Network** connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine, facilitating water flow.\n- **Small Electric Poles** at positions (-1.5, 26.5), (-0.5, 26.5), and (0.5, 26.5) intended for power distribution.\n\n### Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0)\n- **Furnace** with coal as fuel but lacking ingredients to smelt, currently holding iron plates.\n\n### Lab at Position (Not Specified)\n- **Lab** with automation science packs but lacking power, intended for research purposes.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors When Inserting Items\n- Ensure that the items you wish to insert into an entity are available in your inventory. For example, attempting to insert 20 coal into a boiler failed due to insufficient coal in the inventory.\n\n### Errors Related to Power Connectivity\n- Verify that all generators and power-consuming entities are properly connected to the power network to ensure functionality. The steam engine is not connected to the power network, which may cause power issues.\n\n### Errors Related to Fuel Supply\n- Regularly check and replenish the fuel supply for entities like boilers to maintain continuous operation. The boiler is currently out of fuel.\n\n### Errors Related to Resource Supply\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. The stone furnace lacks ingredients, which prevents it from producing outputs."}
