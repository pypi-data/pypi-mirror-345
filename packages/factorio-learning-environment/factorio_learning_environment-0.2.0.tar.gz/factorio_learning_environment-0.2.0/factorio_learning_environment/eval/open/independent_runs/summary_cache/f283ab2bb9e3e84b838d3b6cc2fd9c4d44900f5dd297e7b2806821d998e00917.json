{"content": "# Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) fueled with coal, actively mining iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (x=-15.5, y=-48.5) and (x=-14.5, y=-48.5), used for storing mined iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserters** at positions (x=-13.5, y=-48.5), (x=-14.5, y=-47.5), and (x=-11.5, y=-46.5), transferring iron ore to furnaces.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (x=-12.0, y=-48.0) and (x=-10.0, y=-48.0), used for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Storage Chests** at various positions for storing iron plates, including (x=-14.5, y=-46.5) which contains both iron ore and iron plates.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (x=-6.5, y=-49.5), (x=-6.5, y=-48.5), (x=-7.5, y=-48.5), (x=-5.5, y=-48.5), (x=-4.5, y=-48.5), and (x=-3.5, y=-48.5), used for storing iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Full Storage Chests\n- Ensure that storage chests have enough space before attempting to insert items. Consider adding more storage chests or rearranging existing ones to accommodate additional items.\n\n### Errors with Entity Placement\n- Before placing a new entity, verify that the target position is unoccupied and suitable for the entity type. Rearrange existing structures if necessary to create space.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that inserters have access to source items and are correctly positioned to pick up items from the source entity.\n\n### Errors with Missing Entities\n- When attempting to interact with an entity, ensure the entity exists at the specified position. Double-check the entity type and position before performing actions.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Fuel\n- Regularly refuel burner inserters and drills to prevent them from running out of fuel and halting operations."}
