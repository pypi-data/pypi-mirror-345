{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Ore Mining Setup at Position (x=-17.0, y=-52.0)\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-17.0, y=-52.0) mining iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-16.5, y=-50.5) collecting iron ore from the drill.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-15.0, y=-51.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-14.5, y=-52.5) transferring items between the furnace and chest.\n\n#### Coal Mining Setup at Position (x=43.0, y=-86.0)\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=43.0, y=-86.0) mining coal.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=43.5, y=-84.5) collecting coal from the drill.\n- **Transport Belt** at position (x=41.5, y=-84.5) connecting the drill to the chest.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=41.5, y=-83.5) transferring coal from the belt to the chest.\n\n#### Smelting Setup at Position (x=43.0, y=-79.0)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=43.0, y=-79.0) for smelting coal or other resources.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=43.5, y=-80.5) transferring items to the furnace.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=43.5, y=-76.5) for storing smelted items.\n\n---\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when placing entities without sufficient inventory\n- Ensure you have the required item in your inventory before attempting to place it (e.g., burner mining drill, wooden chest).\n\n#### Errors when placing entities in occupied tiles\n- Check the target position for existing entities before placing a new entity. Remove or relocate obstructing entities if necessary.\n\n#### Errors when connecting belts directly to chests\n- Use inserters to transfer items between chests and belts or other entities. Belts cannot directly connect to chests.\n\n#### Errors when inserting items without sufficient inventory\n- Ensure you have the required items (e.g., coal, iron ore) in your inventory before attempting to insert them into furnaces or drills.\n\n#### Errors when crafting without required ingredients\n- Ensure you have all necessary ingredients (e.g., iron plates) and access to a crafting machine or furnace before attempting to craft items.\n\n#### Errors when placing entities too far away\n- Move closer to the target position before attempting to place an entity. The maximum placement distance is 10 tiles.\n\n#### Errors when smelting without ingredients or fuel\n- Ensure furnaces have both fuel (e.g., coal) and smelting ingredients (e.g., iron ore) to function properly."}
