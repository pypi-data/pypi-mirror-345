{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone furnace at position (56.0, -62.0)\nConsists of a stone furnace. It is used for smelting iron ore into iron plates. The furnace currently contains 45 coal and has smelted 46 iron plates.\n\n### Coal mine at position (52.0, -82.0)\nConsists of a burner mining drill and a wooden chest at position (52.5, -80.5). The drill is mining coal and placing it into the chest. The chest contains 39 coal.\n\n### Iron ore mine at position (4.0, -60.0)\nConsists of a burner mining drill at position (4.0, -60.0), a stone furnace at position (4.0, -58.0), a burner inserter at position (4.5, -56.5), and a wooden chest at position (4.5, -55.5). The drill mines iron ore and places it into the furnace. The inserter takes items from the furnace and puts them into the chest. The furnace contains 3 iron ore. The chest contains 27 iron plates.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Cannot craft items directly in inventory\n- The agent is trying to craft iron plates directly in its inventory, which is not possible. Iron plates must be crafted in a stone furnace or other crafting machine. Place a stone furnace and insert iron ore and coal into it to produce iron plates.\n\n### Cannot place entity without having it in inventory\n- The agent attempted to place a burner mining drill without having one in its inventory. Craft the burner mining drill before attempting to place it.\n\n### Cannot harvest if out of reach\n- The agent attempted to harvest a resource that was out of reach. Move closer to the resource before attempting to harvest it.\n\n### Cannot insert item if not in inventory\n- The agent attempted to insert coal into a furnace without having any coal in its inventory. Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into a building.\n\n### Missing ingredients for crafting\n- The agent is attempting to craft a burner mining drill but is missing the required ingredients. The agent needs to craft iron plates and iron gear wheels first. Ensure you have all the necessary ingredients before attempting to craft an item.\n- The agent is attempting to craft a burner mining drill but is missing stone to craft a stone furnace, which is a sub-ingredient. Mine stone before attempting to craft the burner mining drill. Note that stone cannot be crafted, it must be gathered as a raw resource.\n\n### Placement collision\n- The agent attempted to place a stone furnace at a location that was blocked by a wooden chest. Ensure there is enough space to place an entity, and that no other entities are blocking the placement. Consider increasing the spacing, changing the direction, or changing the reference position.\n\n### NAMESPACE\nNo functions have been defined by the agent.\n\nImportant variables:\n- None\n"}
