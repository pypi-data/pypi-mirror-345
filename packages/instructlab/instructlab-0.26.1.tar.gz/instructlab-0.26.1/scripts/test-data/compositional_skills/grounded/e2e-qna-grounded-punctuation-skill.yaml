      The Boston Tea Party was an American political and mercantile
      protest on December 16, 1773, by the Sons of Liberty in Boston
      in colonial Massachusetts. The target was the Tea Act of May 10,
      1773, which allowed the East India Company to sell tea from China
      in American colonies without paying taxes apart from those imposed
      by the Townshend Acts. The Sons of Liberty strongly opposed the
      taxes in the Townshend Act as a violation of their rights. In
      response, the Sons of Liberty, some disguised as Native Americans,
      destroyed an entire shipment of tea sent by the East India Company.

      Dolphins are widespread. Most species prefer the warm waters of the
      tropic zones, but some, such as the right whale dolphin, prefer
      colder climates. Dolphins feed largely on fish and squid, but a few,
      such as the orca, feed on large mammals such as seals. Male dolphins
      typically mate with multiple females every year, but females only
      mate every two to three years. Calves are typically born in the
      spring and summer months, and females bear all the responsibility
      for raising them. Mothers of some species fast and nurse their young
      for a relatively long period of time. Dolphins produce a variety of
      vocalizations, usually in the form of clicks and whistles.

      Have you ever seen that cat that lives down the street? He's not a
      normal cat; he's 10 feet tall and full of colorful spots. One time,
      I saw him drink all the water from a small pond! The people swimming
      were upset until they saw him. It's hard to stay mad at a cat like
      thatâ€”except for that other time that he decided to sit on someone's
      lap. That guy was furious!

      A popular variation of traditional lemonade, pink lemonade, is created
      by adding additional fruit juices, flavors, or food coloring to the
      recipe. Most store-bought pink lemonade is simply colored with
      concentrated grape juice or dyes. Among those using natural colors,
      grape is the most popular, but cranberry juice, beet juice or syrup
      made from brightly colored fruits and vegetables such as rhubarb,
      raspberries, strawberries, or cherries are also used.
