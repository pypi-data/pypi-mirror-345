{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Ore Mine at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position: x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n- Wooden chest (position: x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n- Burner inserter (position: x=-13.5, y=-48.5)\n- Burner inserter (position: x=-12.5, y=-48.5)\n\n#### Iron Plate Smelting Facility at position (52.0, -79.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position: x=52.0, y=-79.0)\n- Burner inserter (position: x=53.5, y=-79.5)\n- Wooden chest (position: x=54.5, y=-79.5)\n- Burner inserter (position: x=55.5, y=-78.5)\n- Wooden chest (position: x=56.5, y=-78.5)\n\n#### Storage Area at position (0.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest (position: x=0.5, y=0.5)\n- Wooden chest (position: x=1.5, y=0.5)\n- Wooden chest (position: x=2.5, y=0.5)\n- Wooden chest (position: x=3.5, y=0.5)\n- Wooden chest (position: x=4.5, y=0.5)\n- Wooden chest (position: x=5.5, y=0.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Mining drill not working due to lack of fuel\n- Ensure the burner mining drill is fueled with coal or other fuel sources to operate. Check the fuel inventory of the drill and refill it if necessary.\n\n#### Inserter out of fuel\n- Inserters require fuel to function. Ensure that all burner inserters have sufficient fuel in their inventory to operate.\n\n#### Chest at drop position is full\n- Empty the chest at the drop position of the mining drill to allow it to continue mining. Ensure there is space in the chest for the mined resources.\n\n#### Furnace has no ingredients to smelt\n- Provide the furnace with the necessary raw materials (e.g., iron ore) to begin smelting. Ensure that inserters are correctly configured to supply the furnace with ingredients.\n\n#### Inserter waiting for source items\n- Ensure that the inserter has access to the items it needs to pick up. Check the source inventory and ensure it is not empty.\n\n#### AssertionError: Mining drill not working\n- The mining drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) is not working. Check for fuel, ensure the chest at the drop position is not full, and verify the drill is correctly placed over resources.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n#### Utility Functions\n- None defined yet.\n\n#### Important Variables\n- None assigned yet."}
