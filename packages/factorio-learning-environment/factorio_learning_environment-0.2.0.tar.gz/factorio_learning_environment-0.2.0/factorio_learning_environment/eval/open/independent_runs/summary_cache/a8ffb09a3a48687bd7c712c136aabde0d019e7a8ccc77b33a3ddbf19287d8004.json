{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Group at position(x)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Small electric poles at positions (-25.5, 28.5), (-25.5, 29.5), (-21.5, 29.5), (-15.5, 22.5), (-14.5, 23.5), (-22.5, 25.5)\n\n### Pipe Groups\nConsists of the following entities:\n- PipeGroup (fluid_system=65978) at position (-22.5, -50.5) with pipes at positions (-22.5, -50.5), (-22.5, -51.5), (-23.5, -51.5), ..., (-14.5, 13.5), (-14.5, 12.5), (-14.5, 14.5)\n- PipeGroup (fluid_system=65979) at position (-10.5, 23.5) with pipes at positions (-10.5, 23.5), (-12.5, 24.5), (-12.5, 25.5), (-11.5, 24.5), (-10.5, 24.5)\n- PipeGroup (fluid_system=65981) at position (-36.5, 30.5) with a pipe at position (-36.5, 30.5)\n- PipeGroup (fluid_system=65982) at position (-32.5, 30.5) with a pipe at position (-32.5, 30.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### TypeError when accessing object properties\n- When accessing properties of an object, ensure you are using the correct syntax. For example, avoid using subscript notation on objects that do not support it (e.g., 'Pipe' object)."}
