{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES  \n\n#### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Operation (Updated)  \n- **Burner mining drills**:  \n  - At (16.0, 71.0) (`WORKING`, output blocked by ground items, fuel: 7 coal).  \n  - At (19.0, 71.0) and (22.0, 71.0) (`NO_FUEL`).  \n- **Stone furnaces**:  \n  - At (16.0, 73.0) (`WORKING`, coal: 28, processing iron ore).  \n  - At (19.0, 73.0) and (22.0, 73.0) (`NO_INGREDIENTS`, fuel full but no ore input).  \n- **Output system**:  \n  - **Burner inserters** at (16.5, 74.5) (`WORKING`), (19.5, 74.5), and (22.5, 74.5) (`WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS`).  \n  - **Wooden chests** at (16.5, 75.5) (40 iron plates), (19.5, 75.5), and (22.5, 75.5) (both 150 iron plates).  \n\n#### Power Generation Setup (Unchanged)  \n- **Offshore pump** at (-9.5, -0.5) with connected pipes.  \n- **Boiler** at (-7.0, 0.5) (`WORKING`).  \n- **Steam engine** still unplaced.  \n\n### ERROR TIPS  \n\n#### Placement and Proximity Issues  \n- **Entity too far to place**: Repeated attempts to place entities (e.g., furnace at (16.0, 73.0)) from (0, 0). Move within 10 tiles.  \n- **Blocked placement**: Burner inserter at (16.0, 72.0) failed due to terrain/water. Verify tile passability.  \n\n#### Production Bottlenecks  \n- **Drill output blocked**: Drills at (16.0, 71.0) drop ore on ground. Add chests/belts to collect output.  \n- **Furnace fuel shortages**: Drills at (19.0, 71.0) and (22.0, 71.0) lack coal. Prioritize fuel supply.  \n- **Furnace input shortages**: Furnaces at (19.0, 73.0) and (22.0, 73.0) idle due to no ore. Ensure drills feed furnaces directly or via belts.  \n\n#### Entity Management  \n- **Invalid entity queries**: Attempts to fetch non-existent furnaces (e.g., at (16.5, 73.5)). Verify positions before querying.  \n\n#### General Tips  \n- **Stabilize fuel supply**: Coal must reach all drills/furnaces to prevent cascading halts.  \n- **Debug tools**: Use `debug` mode to inspect entity connections and item flow.  \n\n### NAMESPACE  \nNo new functions or variables were defined.  \n\n---  \n**Key Updates**:  \n- Furnace at (16.0, 73.0) rebuilt and operational.  \n- Throughput dropped to 19 iron plates/minute due to fuel/input shortages.  \n- Chests at (19.5, 75.5) and (22.5, 75.5) near capacity (150 plates)."}
