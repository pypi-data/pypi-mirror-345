{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, y=-60.0) fueled with coal, extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (5.5, y=-60.5) and (4.5, y=-58.5) for storing extracted iron ore, with a warning that the chest at (4.5, y=-58.5) is full.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (-15.0, y=-48.0), (-13.0, y=-48.0), and (-11.0, y=-48.0) fueled with coal, converting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Iron Chest** at position (-5.5, y=-50.5) storing iron ore and iron plates.\n\n### Storage System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Multiple **Wooden Chests** at positions (-14.5, y=-50.5), (-13.5, y=-50.5), (-12.5, y=-50.5), (-11.5, y=-50.5), (-10.5, y=-50.5), (-9.5, y=-50.5), (-8.5, y=-50.5), (-7.5, y=-50.5), (-6.5, y=-50.5), storing iron plates, with warnings of full capacity for chests at positions (-11.5, y=-50.5), (-10.5, y=-50.5), (-9.5, y=-50.5), and (-8.5, y=-50.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Full Storage\n- Ensure that storage chests are emptied regularly to prevent production halts. The chest at (4.5, y=-58.5) and several others in the storage system are full, which can stop mining and production processes.\n\n### Warnings from Burner Mining Drill\n- The burner mining drill at (4.0, y=-60.0) has a warning about the chest at the drop position being full. Regularly check and empty the chest to maintain continuous operation of the mining drill.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `coal`: int, representing the amount of coal in inventory.\n- `iron-ore`: int, representing the amount of iron ore in inventory.\n- `iron-plate`: int, representing the amount of iron plates in inventory.\n- `iron-gear-wheel`: int, representing the amount of iron gear wheels in inventory."}
