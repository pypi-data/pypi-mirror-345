{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Setup at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and outputs to a wooden chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the stone furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates, but currently not receiving iron ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Misalignment Issues\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly aligned to transfer items from the source entity (wooden chest) to the target entity (stone furnace). Frequent repositioning suggests alignment issues.\n\n### Fuel Management Errors\n- Keep a sufficient supply of coal in your inventory to refuel all entities, including mining drills and inserters. Running out of fuel can halt operations.\n\n### Chest Management\n- Regularly check and empty the wooden chest to prevent it from becoming full, which can stop the mining drill from operating.\n\n### Furnace Operation Errors\n- Verify that the furnace is receiving the necessary ingredients (iron ore) to function. Check the inserter setup to ensure proper item transfer.\n\n### Resource Extraction Proximity\n- Make sure to be close enough to entities when extracting resources to avoid errors related to being too far from the target entity."}
