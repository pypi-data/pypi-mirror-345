{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Transfer System at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and transfers it to a nearby chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace. Currently misaligned with the chest, causing transfer issues.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates but is not receiving ore due to inserter misalignment.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Alignment Errors\n- Ensure that the inserter's pickup position aligns with the chest's position. The pickup position should be set to (-14.5, -48.5) to match the chest's position.\n- Verify that the inserter's drop position aligns with the furnace's position. The drop position should be set to (0.0, 0.0) to match the furnace's position.\n\n### Fuel Management for Inserters and Drills\n- Regularly check and refuel inserters and drills to prevent them from running out of fuel. This ensures continuous operation and avoids production halts.\n\n### Inventory Management\n- Keep track of coal and other fuel resources in your inventory to avoid running out during critical operations. Ensure that there is enough coal to refuel all necessary entities."}
