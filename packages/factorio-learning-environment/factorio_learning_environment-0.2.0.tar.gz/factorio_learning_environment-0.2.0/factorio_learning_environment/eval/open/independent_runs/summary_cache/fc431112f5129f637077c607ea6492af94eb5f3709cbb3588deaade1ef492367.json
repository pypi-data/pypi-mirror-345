{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) with a drop position at (x=-15.5, y=-51.5), connected to:\n  - **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-15.5, y=-51.5) storing iron ore.\n  - **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-51.5) which moves items from the wooden chest onto a transport belt.\n- **Transport Belt** group that moves iron ore from the chest to the furnace:\n  - Belt segment from (x=-13.5, y=-51.5) to (x=-11.5, y=-51.5) in the RIGHT direction.\n  - Belt segment from (x=0.5, y=-3.5) to (x=0.5, y=-1.5) in the DOWN direction.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) which processes iron ore into iron plates.\n  - **Burner Inserter** at position (x=0.5, y=-1.5) which moves items from the transport belt into the furnace.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Full Chest\n- Ensure that the chest at the mining drill's drop position is regularly emptied to prevent mining stoppages. The warning indicates that the chest at position (x=-15.5, y=-51.5) is full, which halts the mining process.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Defined Utility Functions\n- None defined in the provided logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `Inventory`: A dictionary type representing the player's current inventory, including items like 'wood', 'coal', 'stone', 'iron-ore', and 'iron-plate'.\n\nNo utility functions have been invoked or defined in the provided logs."}
