Verify the coordinates and the presence of the pipe.\n\n### Errors When Placing Pipes\n- Ensure there is no existing object in the way before placing a pipe. Check the target location for any obstructions.\n\n### Boiler Not Receiving Water\n- Verify the connections between the offshore pump, pipes, and boiler to ensure water flow. Check for any disconnected or improperly connected pipes.\n\n### Steam Engine Not Connected\n- Ensure that the steam engine is properly connected to the boiler and the pipe network to receive steam. Check for any missing or misaligned connections."}
