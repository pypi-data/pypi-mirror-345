{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (52.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (52.0, -82.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (53.5, -80.5).\n- Burner Inserter at position (52.5, -79.5) transferring items from the Wooden Chest at (53.5, -80.5) to another Wooden Chest at (52.5, -78.5).\n- Additional Burner Inserter at position (52.5, -76.5) connected to a Wooden Chest at (52.5, -77.5).\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-12.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-12.0, -51.0) connected to a Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) and a Wooden Chest at position (-11.5, -49.5).\n- Burner Inserter at position (-11.5, -48.5) transferring items from the Wooden Chest at (-11.5, -49.5).\n- Additional Burner Inserters at positions (-8.5, -48.5) and (-13.5, -46.5) waiting for source items.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entities have items available for the inserters to transfer. Check for blockages or missing items in the source entities.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Space in Destination\n- Make sure that the destination entities have enough space to accommodate the items being transferred by the inserters. Empty the destination chests if they are full to continue the operation.\n\n### Chest Full Warnings\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are full to prevent blockages in the mining and transfer operations.\n\n### No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Ensure that the furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Regularly supply the furnaces with raw materials to maintain production.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - None defined or invoked in the provided logs.\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `wooden-chest`: int = 3\n  - `wood`: int = 10\n  - `coal`: int = 495\n  - `iron-ore`: int = 1296\n  - `iron-plate`: int = 1265"}
