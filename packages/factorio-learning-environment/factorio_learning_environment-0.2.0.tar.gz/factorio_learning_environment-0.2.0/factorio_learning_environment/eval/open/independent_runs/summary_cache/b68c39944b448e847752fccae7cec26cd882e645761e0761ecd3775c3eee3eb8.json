{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Stone Furnace Automation at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace positioned at (-15.0, -50.0) used for smelting iron ore into iron plates. Recent operations supplied 5 units of iron ore and observed output of 4 iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest positioned at (-13.5, -49.5) serving as storage for iron plates output from the furnace.\n- Burner Inserter positioned at (-14.5, -48.5) that automates the transfer of items between the furnace and the chest.\n\nERROR TIPS\n### Inconsistent Extraction Quantities\n- Ensure that the extraction operation retrieves the anticipated number of items consistently. Validate the extraction process to match expected output amounts.\n  \n### Errors with Incorrect Insertion Arguments and Inventory Checks\n- Always verify that the target entity is correctly passed as an argument when inserting items, and confirm sufficient inventory is available before insertion.\n  \n### Insufficient Production Output Verification Failures\n- Allow ample time for smelting to complete before asserting production outputs.\n  \n### Resource Retrieval and Placement Timing Issues\n- Confirm resource locations are correct and accessible prior to initiating harvesting, and maintain proper synchronization between harvesting and insertion actions.\n  \n### Cumulative Production Delay and Timeout Management\n- Adjust wait periods if smelting outputs are delayed to avoid premature checks on production outcomes.\n  \n### Fuel Insertion and Inventory Availability Errors\n- Before refueling entities such as inserters, verify that the inventory contains the required fuel item, ensuring proper inventory checks to prevent errors."}
