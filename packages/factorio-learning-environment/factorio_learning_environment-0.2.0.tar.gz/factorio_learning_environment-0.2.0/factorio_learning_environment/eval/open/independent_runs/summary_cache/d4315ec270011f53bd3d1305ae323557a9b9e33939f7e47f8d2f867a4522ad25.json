{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=20.5, y=-4.0)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (x=19.5, y=-1.5)\n- Boiler at Position (x=20.5, y=-4.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (x=22.5, y=-7.5)\n- Connected by PipeGroup with fluid system ID 10391\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Furnace at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates\n- Inserter at Position (x=-3.5, y=1.5) for moving items\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (x=20.0, y=20.0) extracting copper ore\n- Wooden Chest at Position (x=19.5, y=18.5) storing copper ore\n- Furnace at Position (x=2.0, y=0.0) for smelting copper ore into copper plates\n\n### Copper Cable Factory\nConsists of:\n- Assembling Machine at Position (x=10.5, y=0.5) producing copper cables\n- Inserter at Position (x=9.5, y=5.5) waiting for source items\n- BeltGroup connecting inputs from (x=10.5, y=4.5) to (x=10.5, y=6.5) and outputs from (x=9.5, y=6.5) to (x=7.5, y=6.5)\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (x=-11.0, y=20.0) extracting iron ore\n- Wooden Chest at Position (x=-11.5, y=18.5) storing iron ore\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Ingredient Shortages\n- Ensure that all required ingredients are available for production processes. For example, the assembling machine at (x=10.5, y=0.5) is unable to produce copper cables due to a shortage of copper plates.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Verify that inserters have access to source items to transfer. Inserters at positions (x=7.5, y=5.5) and (x=9.5, y=5.5) are waiting for source items.\n\n### Errors with Furnaces Having No Ingredients\n- Check that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. The furnace at (x=2.0, y=0.0) has no ingredients to smelt and is in a 'no ingredients' status.\n\n### Errors with Belt Groups Being Empty\n- Ensure that belt groups are properly supplied with items to transport. The belt group near the inserter at (x=10.5, y=4.5) is currently empty."}
