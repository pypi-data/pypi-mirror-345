{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (0.5, 28.0)\nConsists of:\n- Boiler at position (0.5, 28.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-3.5, 27.5)\n- Steam Engine at position (7.5, 39.5)\n- Pipe Network connecting these components\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (40.0, -84.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (40.5, -82.5) for coal storage\n- Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -83.5) as an additional storage\n\n### Iron Plate Storage\nConsists of:\n- Iron Chest at position (0.5, 0.5) containing iron plates\n- Additional Iron Chests at positions (1.5, 0.5) and (2.5, 0.5)\n\n### Incomplete Electricity Network\nConsists of:\n- Small Electric Poles at various positions, not fully connected to power network\n\n### Belt System\nConsists of:\n- BeltGroup with inputs and outputs at various positions, transporting coal\n\n### Inserter and Furnace System\nConsists of:\n- Burner Inserter at position (54.5, -83.5) and (41.5, -80.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -49.0)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source items are available for inserters to pick up. Check the supply chain to ensure continuous flow of materials.\n\n### Errors with Boiler Out of Fuel\n- Regularly check and refuel boilers to maintain electricity generation. Automate fuel supply if possible.\n\n### Errors with Chest at Drop Position Being Full\n- Regularly empty chests to prevent mining drills from stopping due to full storage.\n\n### Errors with Steam Engine Not Connected to Power Network\n- Ensure that steam engines are connected to the power network with electric poles. Check connections and ensure poles are within range.\n\n### Errors with No Input Liquid in Steam Engine\n- Ensure that the pipe network is correctly configured and connected to supply water to the steam engine. Check for any disconnected pipes or incorrect placements."}
