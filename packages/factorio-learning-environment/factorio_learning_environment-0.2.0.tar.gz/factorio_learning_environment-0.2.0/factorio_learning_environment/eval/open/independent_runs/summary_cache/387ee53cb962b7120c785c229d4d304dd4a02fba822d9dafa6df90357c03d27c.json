{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Coal Mine at position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (41.0, -82.0)\n- Wooden chest at position (41.5, -80.5)\n- Burner inserter at position (42.5, -80.5)\n\n#### Iron Smelting Setup at position (52.0, -79.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace at position (52.0, -79.0)\n- Burner inserter at position (53.5, -79.5)\n- Wooden chest at position (53.5, -78.5)\n- Burner inserter at position (55.5, -78.5)\n- Wooden chest at position (56.5, -78.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when placing entities too far away\n- Ensure the player is within the maximum placement distance (10 tiles) before attempting to place an entity. Move closer to the target position.\n\n#### Errors with inserter pickup/drop positions\n- Verify that the inserter's pickup and drop positions are correctly aligned with the source and destination entities. Use the `rotate_inserter` function to adjust the inserter's direction if necessary.\n\n#### Errors with furnace input/output\n- Ensure the furnace has the correct ingredients (e.g., iron ore and coal) before expecting output. Check the furnace's status and contents to diagnose issues.\n\n#### Errors with chest inventory assertions\n- Before asserting that a chest contains specific items, ensure that the inserter is correctly transferring items to the chest. Verify the inserter's configuration and the furnace's output.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n#### Utility Functions\n- `place_entity(Prototype, position: Position)`: Places an entity at the specified position. Fails if the position is too far away or occupied.\n- `get_entity(Prototype, position: Position)`: Retrieves an entity at the specified position. Fails if no entity of the specified type is found.\n- `rotate_inserter(inserter, direction: Direction)`: Rotates the inserter to face the specified direction. Fails if the direction does not align with pickup/drop positions.\n\n#### Important Variables\n- `furnace: Furnace`: Represents the stone furnace at position (52.0, -79.0).\n- `inserter: BurnerInserter`: Represents the burner inserter at position (53.5, -79.5).\n- `output_chest: Chest`: Represents the wooden chest at position (53.5, -78.5)."}
