Although several steps attempted to place and craft a Lab at (0.5, 2.5), all such attempts failed due to inventory and resource shortages. References to furnaces (an iron furnace at Position(x=5.0, y=5.0) and a copper furnace at Position(x=-27.0, y=-60.0)) indicate that these pre-existing structures were used for smelting but were not constructed by the agent.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 API Usage Errors with get_entities  \n  \u2013 Call get_entities with the correct parameters. Do not include unexpected keywords (such as \"radius\") or extra positional arguments.\n\n\u2022 Lab Placement and Inventory Verification  \n  \u2013 Before attempting to place a Lab, confirm that a Lab item is present in the inventory to avoid placement failures.\n\n\u2022 NoneType Iteration  \n  \u2013 Verify that functions returning collections (e.g., get_entities) do not return None before iterating over their results.\n\n\u2022 Resource Shortages in Lab Crafting  \n  \u2013 Ensure that all required sub-ingredients (iron-gear-wheel, electronic-circuit, copper-cable, copper-plate) are available prior to initiating Lab crafting. Address each missing component by appropriately increasing smelting or crafting operations as needed."}
