{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=1.5, y=23.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\n- Pipe connections:\n  - Pipe-to-ground at position (x=16.5, y=17.5)\n  - Pipe at position (x=17.5, y=17.5)\n  - Pipe network connecting boiler and offshore pump, spanning positions from (x=-9.5, y=23.5) to (x=3.5, y=23.5)\n\n### Pipe Groups\n- PipeGroup with fluid system 11587, positioned at (x=3.5, y=17.5), status: EMPTY\n- PipeGroup with fluid system 11598, positioned at (x=-9.5, y=23.5), status: FULL_OUTPUT\n\n### Electricity Network\n- ElectricityGroup with id 21693, including poles at various positions such as (x=35.5, y=24.5), (x=16.5, y=24.5), and others, with voltage 0\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting pipes\n- Ensure that the entities being connected are compatible and correctly aligned. Verify that the connection points are accessible and that there are no obstructions or misalignments in the pipe network.\n\n### Errors due to missing fluid connections\n- Check that all necessary fluid connections are established and that there are no breaks in the pipe network. Ensure that the fluid system is complete from the source (offshore pump) to the destination (boiler and steam engine).\n\n### Errors due to lack of fuel\n- Regularly refuel entities like boilers to maintain their operation. Monitor fuel levels and automate refueling if possible to prevent interruptions.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `connect_entities`: Attempts to connect entities using specified prototypes. Failure can occur if entities are incompatible or misaligned.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `pipes`: List of pipe entities intended for connection between the boiler and steam engine.\n- `boiler`: Entity representing the boiler, currently positioned at (x=1.5, y=23.0).\n- `steam_engine`: Entity representing the steam engine, currently positioned at (x=17.5, y=20.5)."}
