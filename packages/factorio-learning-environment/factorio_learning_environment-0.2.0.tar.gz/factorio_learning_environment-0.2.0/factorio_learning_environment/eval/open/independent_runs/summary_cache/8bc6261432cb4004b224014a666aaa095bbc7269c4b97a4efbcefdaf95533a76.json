For instance, 'pickup_entity' should be used correctly with entities that support it. Avoid using non-callable objects like 'Chest' in this context.\n\n### Errors due to full storage\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are full to prevent interruptions in mining operations. This will ensure that drills and inserters do not stop due to lack of space in destination chests.\n\n### Errors when inserters are waiting for source items\n- Ensure that the source chests or belts have the necessary items for inserters to function. This can be done by maintaining a steady supply of resources to the source entities."}
