{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility at Position (-25.0, -64.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-25.0, -64.0) extracting copper ore\n- Transport Belt segments at positions (-25.5, -65.5) and (-24.5, -65.5) transporting copper ore\n- Stone Furnace at position (-23.0, -66.0) for smelting copper ore into copper plates\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-19.0, -65.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (-21.5, -65.5) storing coal\n- Burner Inserter at position (-20.5, -65.5) transferring coal from the chest to the furnace\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -65.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Site at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) extracting iron ore\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -54.5) storing extracted iron ore\n\n### Additional Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates\n- Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5) for storing smelted iron plates\n- Burner Inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) transferring items between entities\n\n### Belt Groups\n- Belt Group connecting positions (-26.5, -65.5) to (-24.5, -65.5) and (-25.5, -65.5) to (-23.5, -65.5), transporting copper ore\n- Belt Group connecting positions (-24.5, -64.5) to (-22.5, -64.5) and (-23.5, -64.5) to (-21.5, -64.5), currently empty\n- Belt Group connecting positions (-14.5, -54.5) to (-14.5, -56.5) and (-17.5, -57.5) to (-17.5, -59.5), currently empty\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Insufficient Copper Ore in Furnace\n- Ensure that the transport belts are correctly aligned and connected to deliver copper ore to the furnace. Check for any blockages or misalignments in the belt system.\n\n### Errors When Placing Entities on Occupied Tiles\n- Before placing a new entity, verify that the target tile is unoccupied. Use the map view to check for existing objects that might obstruct placement.\n\n### General Tips\n- Regularly inspect and refuel mining drills and inserters to maintain continuous operation.\n- Monitor furnace inputs to ensure they have the necessary ingredients for smelting processes."}
