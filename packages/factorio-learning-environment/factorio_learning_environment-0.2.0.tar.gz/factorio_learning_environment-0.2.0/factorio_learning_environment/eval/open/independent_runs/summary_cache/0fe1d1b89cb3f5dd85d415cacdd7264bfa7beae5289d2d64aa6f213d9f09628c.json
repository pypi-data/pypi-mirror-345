The function takes 3 positional arguments.\n-  Ensure the arguments passed to the function are of the correct type. The function expects integer values, not floats.\n\n### Errors when accessing entity attributes\n-  Ensure the entity has the attribute being accessed. The 'Position' object does not have a 'position' attribute.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n*   connect_entities: function to connect entities with transport belts\n    *   Failure modes: incorrect number of arguments, incorrect argument types\n    *   Success modes: entities connected successfully\n*   Important variables:\n    *   drill: BurnerMiningDrill entity\n    *   furnace: Furnace entity\n    *   coal_in_inventory: integer value representing the amount of coal in the inventory\n    *   transport_belt: Prototype.TransportBelt entity\n    *   Position: object representing a position on the map\n    *   Entity: object representing an entity on the map"}
