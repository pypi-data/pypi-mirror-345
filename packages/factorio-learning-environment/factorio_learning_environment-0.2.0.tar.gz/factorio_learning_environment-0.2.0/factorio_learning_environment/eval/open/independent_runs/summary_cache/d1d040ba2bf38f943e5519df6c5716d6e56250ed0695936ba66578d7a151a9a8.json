{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Iron Ore Storage**: Iron chest at position (x=-5.5, y=-50.5) storing iron ore and iron plates.\n- **Furnaces**:\n  - Stone furnace at position (x=-15.0, y=-48.0)\n  - Stone furnace at position (x=-13.0, y=-48.0)\n  - Stone furnace at position (x=-11.0, y=-48.0)\n- **Iron Plate Storage**: Multiple wooden chests at positions (x=-11.5, y=-50.5), (x=-10.5, y=-50.5), (x=-9.5, y=-50.5), and (x=-8.5, y=-50.5) storing iron plates.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Site\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill**: Positioned at (x=4.0, y=-60.0) extracting iron ore.\n- **Storage Chests**:\n  - Wooden chest at position (x=4.5, y=-58.5) storing iron ore.\n  - Additional wooden chests at positions (x=5.5, y=-60.5), (x=7.5, y=-60.5), (x=6.5, y=-60.5), (x=9.5, y=-60.5), and (x=8.5, y=-60.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Full Chests\n- Ensure that storage chests are regularly emptied to prevent mining drills from halting operations due to full chests. This can be done by setting up a logistics system or manually transferring items to other storage units.\n\n### Errors Related to Furnace Operations\n- Furnaces are showing warnings of \"no ingredients to smelt.\" Ensure that furnaces are continuously supplied with raw materials to maintain production efficiency. This can be achieved by setting up automated inserters or manually refilling them.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\nNo utility functions have been defined or invoked by the agent in the provided logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- **Inventory**: \n  - `wood`: int = 10\n  - `coal`: int = 510\n  - `iron-ore`: int = 143\n  - `iron-plate`: int = 5198\n  - `iron-gear-wheel`: int = 4"}
