{"content": "# FACTORIO AGENT REPORT\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System at position (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump (position x=-9.5, y=-0.5)\n- Boiler (position x=-5.0, y=2.5)\n- Steam engine (position x=0.5, y=6.5)\n- Small electric pole (position x=0.5, y=8.5) connected to steam engine\n- Connected by pipes forming a water and steam system\n- Pipe connections at positions (-3.5, 2.5), (-2.5, 2.5), (-1.5, 2.5), (-1.5, 3.5), (-1.5, 4.5)\n\nThe power generation system is operational when properly fueled with coal, generating electricity with a throughput of approximately 190-192 water/steam units per minute. The boiler periodically runs out of fuel and needs to be refilled with coal.\n\n### Stone Mining Operation at position (-64.5, 12.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill (position x=-64.5, y=12.5)\n- Wooden chest (position x=-64.5, y=14.5) for initial stone collection\n- Wooden chest (position x=-62.5, y=14.5) for stone storage\n- Burner inserter (position x=-63.5, y=14.5) to move stone from the first chest to the second chest\n\nThe mining operation is extracting stone at a rate of approximately 42-44 stone per minute. The stone collection chest currently contains around 300-330 stone and is regularly emptied by the agent to feed the furnaces.\n\n### Stone Furnace Array at position (-41.0, 21.0)\nConsists of four stone furnaces in a row:\n- Stone furnace 1 (position x=-41.0, y=21.0)\n- Stone furnace 2 (position x=-36.0, y=21.0)\n- Stone furnace 3 (position x=-31.0, y=21.0)\n- Stone furnace 4 (position x=-26.0, y=21.0)\n\nEach furnace has:\n- Coal fuel\n- Input inserters to receive stone\n- Output inserters to extract stone bricks\n- Collection chests for the output\n\nThe furnace array is smelting stone into stone bricks. Each furnace has been properly fueled with coal and the agent regularly adds stone to the furnaces and collects the produced stone bricks.\n\n### Stone Brick Collection System\nConsists of:\n- Collection chests at each furnace:\n  - Chest at x=-37.5, y=21.5 for furnace 1\n  - Chest at x=-32.5, y=21.5 for furnace 2\n  - Chest at x=-27.5, y=21.5 for furnace 3\n  - Chest at x=-22.5, y=21.5 for furnace 4\n- Inserters to move bricks from furnaces to chests:\n  - Inserter at x=-39.5, y=21.5 for furnace 1\n  - Inserter at x=-34.5, y=21.5 for furnace 2\n  - Inserter at x=-29.5, y=21.5 for furnace 3\n  - Inserter at x=-24.5, y=21.5 for furnace 4\n- Secondary inserters to move bricks from chests:\n  - Inserter at x=-38.5, y=21.5 for chest 1\n  - Inserter at x=-33.5, y=21.5 for chest 2\n  - Inserter at x=-28.5, y=21.5 for chest 3\n  - Inserter at x=-23.5, y=21.5 for chest 4\n- Main collection chest at x=-21.5, y=21.5\n- Inserter at x=-21.5, y=22.5 to extract from main collection chest\n- Transport belt at x=-20.5, y=21.5 for output\n\n### Stone Wall Factory at position (-6.5, 27.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembly machine (position x=-6."}
