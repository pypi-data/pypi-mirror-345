{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Furnace at position(x)\nConsists of:\n- Furnace (position y)\n\n### Copper plate factory at position(x)\nConsists of:\n- Furnace (position y) that produces copper plates from copper ore\n- Assembling machine (position z) that requires iron-plate, iron-gear-wheel, and electronic-circuit to produce various items\n\n### Iron gear wheel factory at position(x)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine (position z) that requires iron-plate to produce iron gear wheels\n- Inserter (position a) that puts into the assembling machine\n\n### Copper cable factory at position(x)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine (position z) that requires copper plates to produce copper cables\n- Inserter (position a) that puts into the assembling machine\n\n### Electricity generator at position(x)\nConsists of:\n- Steam engine (position y)\n- Boiler (position z)\n- Offshore pump (position a)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when crafting items due to missing ingredients\n- Ensure you have all required ingredients in your inventory before attempting to craft items. For example, iron-gear-wheel requires iron-plate which must be available.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity on a tile before attempting to place it. Check for existing entities in the desired location.\n\n### Errors when attempting to smelt without the necessary items\n- Always verify that you have the required raw materials (e.g., copper ore for copper plates) in the furnace before starting the smelting process."}
