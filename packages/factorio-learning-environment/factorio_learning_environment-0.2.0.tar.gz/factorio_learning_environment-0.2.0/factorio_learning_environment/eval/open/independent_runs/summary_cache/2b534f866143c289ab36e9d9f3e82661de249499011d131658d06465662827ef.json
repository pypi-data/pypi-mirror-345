{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining Operation at (-15, -15)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (position x=24.0, y=-15.0)\n- Wooden chest (position x=23.5, y=-16.5) containing 45 coal\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Operation at (-14, 23)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (position x=-14.0, y=23.0)\n- Wooden chest (position x=-14.5, y=21.5) containing 435 iron ore\n\n### Copper Processing Complex at (20, 20)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill for copper ore (position x=20.0, y=20.0)\n- Primary buffer chest (position x=20.5, y=21.5)\n- Secondary buffer chest (position x=22.5, y=21.5) containing 342 copper ore\n- Stone furnace (position x=24.0, y=20.0)\n- Output chest (position x=24.5, y=17.5) containing 53 copper plates\n- Multiple burner inserters forming a transport chain:\n  - Mining drill to primary buffer (position x=21.5, y=21.5)\n  - Primary to secondary buffer (position x=22.5, y=20.5)\n  - Secondary buffer to furnace (position x=22.5, y=22.5)\n  - Furnace to output chest (position x=24.5, y=18.5)\n\n### Unused Furnace Group\nTwo inactive stone furnaces at:\n- Position x=-11.0, y=20.0\n- Position x=-9.0, y=20.0\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Configuration Issues\n- Ensure inserters are properly aligned with their pickup and drop positions\n- When reconfiguring inserters, verify that both source and destination positions are accessible\n- Check that inserters have valid entities to insert items into before changing their configuration\n\n### Furnace Operation Issues\n- Furnaces showing \"no ingredients to smelt\" warning: Ensure proper item transport chain is working to feed materials\n- When furnace fuel is full (warning \"furnace fuel source is full\"), focus on fixing material input flow\n\n### Entity Placement Optimization\n- Multiple inserters in the copper processing setup might be redundant - optimize the transport chain\n- Consider the direction and position of entities during initial placement to minimize need for reconfiguration\n\n### Resource Management\n- Monitor fuel levels in burner mining drills and inserters to prevent operation interruption\n- Some burner inserters are waiting for source items - ensure proper supply chain of materials"}
