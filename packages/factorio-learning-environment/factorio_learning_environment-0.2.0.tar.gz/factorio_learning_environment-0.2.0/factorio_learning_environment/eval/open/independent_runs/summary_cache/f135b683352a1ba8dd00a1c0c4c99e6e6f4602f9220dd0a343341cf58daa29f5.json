{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0) fueled by coal, smelting iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter 1** at position (1.5, 0.5), transferring iron plates from the furnace to a wooden chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (2.5, 0.5) storing iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter 2** at position (3.5, 0.5), extracting iron plates from the wooden chest and placing them onto a transport belt.\n- **Transport Belt** connecting positions (3.5, 0.5) to (6.5, 0.5), moving iron plates along the line.\n- **Burner Inserter 3** at position (6.5, 0.5), transferring iron plates from the transport belt to an end chest.\n- **End Wooden Chest** at position (7.5, 0.5) collecting iron plates from the transport belt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied positions\n- Ensure that the target position for placing an entity is unoccupied. Consider adjusting the spacing, direction, or reference position to avoid conflicts with existing entities.\n\n### Errors when attempting to connect belts directly from a chest\n- Use an inserter to transfer items from a chest to a belt. Belts cannot be directly connected to a chest.\n\n### Errors due to lack of resources in inventory\n- Ensure that the required resources are available in your inventory before attempting to place or craft items. For example, gather wood before crafting a wooden chest.\n\n### Errors when crafting without necessary sub-ingredients\n- Verify that all sub-ingredients are available for crafting. Gather raw resources like wood, which cannot be crafted, before attempting to craft items that require them."}
