{"content": "## Report\n\n### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0), connected to:\n  - **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-15.5, y=-48.5)\n  - **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n  - **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5), which transfers materials to:\n    - **Stone Furnace 1** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0)\n    - **Stone Furnace 2** at position (x=-10.0, y=-48.0)\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5), transferring iron ore to:\n  - **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-46.5)\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-8.5, y=-47.5), transferring materials from:\n  - **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-7.5, y=-47.5) to **Stone Furnace 2**\n\n#### Storage and Inventory\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-6.5, y=-48.5) containing 1501 iron plates\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-6.5, y=-47.5) containing 465 iron plates\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors in Code Execution\n- **AttributeError: 'int' object has no attribute 'furnace_source'**\n  - Ensure that the object being accessed has the correct attributes. Verify the type of the variable before accessing its attributes.\n- **ValueError: The first argument must be an Entity or Position object**\n  - When using functions that require specific types, ensure that the arguments passed match the expected types. Check the function documentation for required argument types.\n\n#### Inserter Warnings\n- **Inserter Waiting for Source Items**\n  - Ensure that the inserter has access to source items. Check the supply chain and ensure that the source is not depleted.\n  \n- **Furnace Belt at Drop Position is Blocked**\n  - Ensure that the drop position of the inserter is not obstructed. Check for any blockages or full inventories at the destination.\n\n#### General Tips\n- Regularly refuel burner entities to prevent them from stopping work.\n- Monitor inventory levels and ensure that there is a continuous supply of necessary resources to avoid production halts.\n- Ensure that there is enough coal in the inventory before attempting to refuel entities."}
