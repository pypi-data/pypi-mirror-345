{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-47.5, -123.5)\n- Boiler at position (-46.5, -121.0)\n- Steam Engine at position (-41.5, -117.5)\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -73.0)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (9.0, -64.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (6.0, -62.0)\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) connected to the furnace at position (6.0, -62.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (7.5, -61.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (6.5, -59.5)\n\n### Pipe Network\nConsists of multiple PipeGroups:\n- PipeGroup with fluid system 19602 at position (-0.5, 10.5)\n- PipeGroup with fluid system 19606 at position (-0.5, 17.5)\n- PipeGroup with fluid system 19612 at position (-12.5, 23.5)\n- PipeGroup with fluid system 19616 at position (-5.5, 24.5)\n- PipeGroup with fluid system 19618 at position (1.5, 24.5)\n- PipeGroup with fluid system 19619 at position (2.5, 25.5)\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of:\n- ElectricityGroup with id 212998, including poles at various positions\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using pipes\n- Ensure that pipes are placed correctly at the intended positions to connect the water source to the boiler. Missing pipes at positions (-47.5, -122.5) and (-46.5, -122.5) indicate a gap in the connection.\n\n### Errors when connecting the boiler to the water source\n- Verify that the boiler is properly connected to the offshore pump. The assertion error indicates that the boiler is still not connected, which is crucial for steam generation.\n\n### Errors with power connections\n- Ensure that all electrical entities, such as inserters and labs, are connected to the power network to avoid issues with entities not receiving electricity."}
