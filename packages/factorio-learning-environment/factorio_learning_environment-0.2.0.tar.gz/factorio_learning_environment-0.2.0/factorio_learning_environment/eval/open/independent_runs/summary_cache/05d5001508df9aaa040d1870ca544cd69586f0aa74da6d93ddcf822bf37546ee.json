The network has been extended to connect the steam engine to assemblers with additional power poles.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n* Errors when using undefined variables or attributes:\n  - Make sure to define a variable or attribute before using it. For example, 'wire_assembler' is not defined. Did you mean: copper_wire_assembler?\n* Errors when attempting to get an entity that does not exist at a specified position:\n  - Verify that the entity exists at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it. For example, no burner-inserter found at position (18.5, 20.5) or (25.5, 20.5).\n* Errors when placing entities without being within the maximum allowed distance:\n  - Ensure you are within the maximum allowed distance (10 units) from the target position before attempting to place an entity.\n* Errors when entities are not connected to the power network or have no input liquid:\n  - Ensure that entities requiring power or input liquids are properly connected. For example, the copper wire assembler and electronic circuit assembler are not receiving electricity.\n* Errors when inserting items into an inserter without having the required items in inventory:\n  - Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into an inserter.\n* Errors when accessing an empty list or undefined variables:\n  - Verify that the list is not empty and variables are defined before attempting to access their elements or use them.\n* Errors when crafting items without the required sub-ingredients or crafting machines:\n  - Ensure you have the necessary ingredients and crafting machines before attempting to craft an item. For example, the electronic circuit assembler is missing iron-plate and copper-cable.\n* Errors when attempting to insert items into an inserter that already exists:\n  - Make sure to check if an inserter already exists at the target position before attempting to place a new one.\n* Errors when attempting to craft items without the required ingredients in inventory:\n  - Ensure you have the necessary ingredients in your inventory before attempting to craft an item. For example, copper-plate is not available.\n* Errors when using incorrect attribute names:\n  - Verify that the attribute name is correct. For example, 'ingredient' is not a valid attribute.\n* Errors when inserting incompatible items into a furnace:\n  - Ensure that the item being inserted is compatible with the furnace's current contents. For example, cannot insert iron-ore into a furnace containing copper-ore.\n* Errors when connecting entities with pipes:\n  - Ensure that the source and target entities are properly connected with pipes and that there are no obstructions. For example, failed to connect boiler to steam engine due to blocked connection points.\n* Errors when placing a pipe at a position that is occupied by another entity:\n  - Ensure that the target position is not occupied by another entity before attempting to place a pipe.\n* Errors when extracting items from a furnace that does not contain the required items:\n  - Ensure that the furnace contains the required items before attempting to extract them. For example, could not extract copper-plate from stone-furnace at (19.0, 23.0).\n* Errors when inserting items into an inserter without a valid target entity:\n  - Ensure that there is a valid target entity nearby that can accept the items being inserted. For example, could not find a nearby entity that can accept copper-plate.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n* Important variables:\n  - `iron_drill` (entities.ElectricMiningDrill)\n"}
