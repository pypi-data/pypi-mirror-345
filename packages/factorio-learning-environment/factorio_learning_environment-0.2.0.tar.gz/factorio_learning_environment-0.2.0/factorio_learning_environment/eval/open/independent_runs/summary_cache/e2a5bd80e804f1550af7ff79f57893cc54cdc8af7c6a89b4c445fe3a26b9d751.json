{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Plate Smelting Setup at Position(x=52.0, y=-79.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace at position (x=52.0, y=-79.0)\n- Burner inserter at position (x=53.5, y=-79.5) (out of fuel)\n- Wooden chest at position (x=54.5, y=-79.5) (contains iron plates)\n- Burner inserter at position (x=55.5, y=-78.5) (waiting for source items)\n- Wooden chest at position (x=56.5, y=-78.5) (empty)\n\n#### Iron Ore Mining Setup at Position(x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) (out of fuel)\n- Wooden chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) (empty)\n- Burner inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) (waiting for source items)\n- Burner inserter at position (x=-12.5, y=-48.5) (waiting for source items)\n\n#### Coal Storage Setup at Position(x=41.5, y=-80.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest at position (x=41.5, y=-80.5) (empty)\n- Wooden chest at position (x=43.5, y=-80.5) (contains coal)\n- Burner inserter at position (x=42.5, y=-80.5) (waiting for source items)\n\n#### General Storage Setup at Position(x=0.5, y=0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest at position (x=0.5, y=0.5) (contains various items)\n- Wooden chest at position (x=1.5, y=0.5) (contains various items)\n- Wooden chest at position (x=2.5, y=0.5) (contains coal)\n- Wooden chest at position (x=3.5, y=0.5) (contains coal)\n- Wooden chest at position (x=4.5, y=0.5) (contains coal and iron ore)\n- Wooden chest at position (x=5.5, y=0.5) (contains iron ore, plates, and gear wheels)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors with mining drill not working\n- Ensure the mining drill has fuel and the output chest is not full. The mining drill at (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) is out of fuel and the chest at (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) is full. Empty the chest and refuel the drill to resume operations.\n\n#### Errors with burner inserters not functioning\n- Ensure burner inserters have fuel and are correctly positioned to pick up and drop items. The burner inserter at (x=53.5, y=-79.5) is out of fuel, and others are waiting for source items. Refuel and check item availability.\n\n#### Errors with furnaces not smelting\n- Ensure furnaces have both fuel and ingredients to smelt. The furnace at (x=52.0, y=-79.0) has no ingredients. Provide iron ore and coal to resume smelting.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n#### Utility Functions\n- None defined yet.\n\n#### Important Variables\n- None assigned yet."}
