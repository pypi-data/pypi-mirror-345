{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) with fuel inventory containing coal and status as working.\n- Stone Furnace at position (41.0, -80.0) connected to the mining drill, with fuel inventory containing coal but no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Iron Plate Mine at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) with no fuel and status indicating no fuel.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) connected to the mining drill.\n\n### Copper Furnace Setup at Position (-20.0, -71.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -71.0) with fuel inventory containing coal but no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Storage Facility\n- Wooden Chest at position (43.5, -79.5) with normal status and empty inventory.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Insufficient Inventory\n- Ensure that the inventory has the required items before attempting to insert them into entities. For example, the attempt to insert coal into the iron mining drill failed due to insufficient coal in the inventory.\n\n### Errors Related to No Ingredients in Furnaces\n- Regularly check that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. The stone furnaces at positions (41.0, -80.0) and (-20.0, -71.0) are not operational due to a lack of ingredients.\n\n### Errors Due to Fuel Shortage\n- Ensure that all mining drills have adequate fuel to function. The burner mining drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) is not operational due to a lack of fuel.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `insert_item`: Used to insert items into entities. Ensure the inventory has the required items before invoking this function to avoid exceptions.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `iron_drill`: Represents the iron mining drill entity.\n- `Prototype.Coal`: Represents the coal item used for fueling entities."}
