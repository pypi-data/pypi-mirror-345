{"content": "\"\"\"\nIt appears that there are no available chests or storage entities to store the iron plates, which is preventing the furnace from continuing its operation due to the `FULL_OUTPUT` status.\n\n### Current Inventory Status:\n- **Stone Furnaces**: 3\n- **Wood**: 16\n- **Coal**: 46 (still available)\n- **Stone**: 5\n- **Iron Ore**: 0 (all processed)\n- **Iron Plates**: 3 (currently in inventory)\n- **Copper Plates**: 6 (produced earlier)\n\n### Observations:\nThe furnace is effectively halted due to lack of storage for the produced iron plates. The `NO_FUEL` status is misleading, as the real issue is the inability to process further due to output constraints.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Craft Storage Solutions**: I need to gather materials to craft a storage chest or another form of inventory management to hold the iron plates.\n2. **Gather Resources**: Since I need wood to craft a chest, I should consider gathering more wood or other materials to facilitate this.\n\nLet's proceed to gather more wood to craft a storage chest.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Find the nearest wood resource position to gather more wood\nnearest_wood_resource = nearest(Resource.Wood)\nharvest_resource(nearest_wood_resource, quantity=5)  # Attempt to gather more wood\n\n# Check the inventory after gathering more wood resources\nprint(f\"Inventory after gathering more wood: {inspect_inventory()}\")  # Verify updated inventory after gathering.", "summary_range": "[1-252]"}
