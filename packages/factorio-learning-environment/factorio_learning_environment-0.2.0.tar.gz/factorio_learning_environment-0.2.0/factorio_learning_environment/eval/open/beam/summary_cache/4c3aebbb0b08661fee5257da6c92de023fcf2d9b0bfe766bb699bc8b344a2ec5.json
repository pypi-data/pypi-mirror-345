{"content": "The attempt to place the stone furnace failed because the target position was too far from the player's current position. The error message indicates that the distance exceeded the maximum allowable distance for placing entities, which is 10 tiles. The player was at position (0, 0), while the furnace was being placed at (-15.5, 25.5), resulting in a distance of approximately 29.84 tiles.\n\n### Tips to Avoid Future Errors:\n\n1. **Check Distance Before Placement**: Always ensure that the target position for placing an entity is within the maximum distance allowed. You can calculate the distance between your current position and the target position before attempting to place the entity.\n\n2. **Use `move_to` Function**: If the target position is too far, use the `move_to` function to get closer to the desired location before placing the entity.\n\n3. **Incremental Placement**: If you need to place multiple entities, consider placing them incrementally. Move closer to the desired area and place each entity one at a time to ensure you stay within the allowable distance.\n\n4. **Verify Current Position**: Regularly check your current position using the environment's functions to confirm your location before executing placement commands.\n\n5. **Use Nearest Buildable Function**: When looking for a suitable position to place an entity, consider using the `nearest_buildable` function to find a valid position that is already within range.\n\nBy following these practices, you can avoid placement errors and ensure a smoother construction process in the game.", "summary_range": "[1-66]"}
