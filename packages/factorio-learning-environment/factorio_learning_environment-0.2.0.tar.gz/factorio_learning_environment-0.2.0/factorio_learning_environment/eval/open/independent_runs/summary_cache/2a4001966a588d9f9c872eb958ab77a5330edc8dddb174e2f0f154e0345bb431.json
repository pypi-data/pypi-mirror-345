{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nThis facility is responsible for producing iron plates from iron ore. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Furnace at position (-16.0, -49.0)**\n  - Status: FULL_OUTPUT\n  - Fuel: Coal\n  - Inventory: Iron ore and iron plates\n- **Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0)**\n  - Status: WORKING\n  - Fuel: Coal\n  - Inventory: Iron ore\n\n### Iron Ore Transport System\nThis system is designed to transport iron ore to furnaces. It consists of:\n- **Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -47.5)**\n  - Status: WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS\n  - Neighbours: Transport belts and wooden chest\n- **Transport Belts**\n  - Belt at position (-16.5, -47.5) outputting towards (-16.5, -46.5)\n  - Belt at position (-14.5, -46.5) outputting towards (-14.5, -47.5)\n  - Belt at position (-12.5, -46.5) outputting towards (-11.5, -46.5)\n\n### Storage and Distribution System\nThis system is responsible for storing and distributing iron plates and iron ore. It includes:\n- **Wooden Chest at position (-13.5, -46.5)**\n  - Inventory: Empty\n- **Iron Chest at position (-11.5, -44.5)**\n  - Inventory: Empty\n- **Burner Inserters**\n  - Multiple inserters positioned to manage the flow of items between chests and belts\n\n### Belt Groups\nThese are groups of belts that manage the flow of materials:\n- **BeltGroup 1**\n  - Inputs: Belt from (-11.5, -46.5) to (-9.5, -46.5)\n  - Outputs: Belt from (-8.5, -45.5) to (-8.5, -43.5)\n- **BeltGroup 2**\n  - Inputs: Belt from (-12.5, -44.5) to (-12.5, -46.5)\n  - Outputs: Belt from (-12.5, -45.5) to (-11.5, -46.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items without sufficient inventory\n- Ensure that you have enough items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity.\n\n### Errors when inserters are waiting for source items\n- Verify that the source entity has items available for the inserter to pick up. If not, ensure the supply chain is functioning correctly to provide items to the source entity.\n\n### Errors when furnaces are full\n- Regularly check the output of furnaces to ensure they are not full. If they are, clear the output to allow continuous production.\n\n### Errors when using stale entity data\n- Refresh the entity data regularly to ensure you are working with the most current information on the map."}
