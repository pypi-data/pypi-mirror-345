{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace (position 0.0, 0.0)\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position (42.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position 42.0, -83.0)\n- Burner Inserter (position 43.5, -81.5) that is waiting for space in destination\n- Wooden Chest (position 42.5, -81.5) with coal inventory\n- Burner Inserter (position 42.5, -80.5) that is waiting for source items\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position -15.0, -50.0)\n- Wooden Chest (position -14.5, -48.5) with iron ore inventory\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to fuel depletion\n- Regularly check the fuel status of burner mining drills. If they are showing \"NO_FUEL,\" ensure to insert fuel promptly to maintain operation.\n\n### Errors when inserters are waiting for items\n- Ensure that the source items are available in the inventory of the wooden chest or other sources to prevent inserters from waiting for source items.\n\n### Errors when inserters are waiting for space\n- Monitor the destination inventory to ensure there is space available for inserters to place items. If inserters are waiting for space, consider increasing the capacity of the destination or managing the inventory more efficiently.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure that you can place an entity on a tile before attempting to place it. Check for any existing entities that might block placement.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the current execution steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `coal`: int\n- `iron-ore`: int\n- `iron-plate`: int\n- `iron-gear-wheel`: int\n- `wood`: int"}
