Verify that the targeted fluid_system identifier is accurate and that a corresponding pipe group exists within the required radius before attempting a connection.\n\n\u2022 Inventory Attribute Usage:\n  - Use only supported inventory attributes when accessing or modifying inventory items to prevent attribute-related errors.\n\n\u2022 Consistency in Connection Parameters:\n  - Ensure that fluid_system identifiers and connection parameters match the current map configuration to avoid mismatches during pipe group lookups."}
