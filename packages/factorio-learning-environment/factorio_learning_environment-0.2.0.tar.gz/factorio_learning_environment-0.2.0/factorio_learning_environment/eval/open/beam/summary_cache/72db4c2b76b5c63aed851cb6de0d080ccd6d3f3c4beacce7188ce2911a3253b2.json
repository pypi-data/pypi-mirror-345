Check the inventory and ensure that the necessary items are present.\n\n### Errors when asserting inventory items\n- Make sure to craft or acquire the required items (e.g., stone furnaces) before attempting to use them in your processes.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into the furnace\n- Verify that you have the necessary items in your inventory before trying to insert them into the furnace. If you attempt to insert items that you do not have, it will result in an error.\n\n### Errors when inserting coal into the furnace\n- Ensure that you have coal in your inventory before attempting to insert it into the furnace. If you run out of coal, the furnace will not operate.\n\n### Errors related to crafting items\n- Ensure that the required technology is researched before attempting to craft items that depend on it. For example, the assembling machine requires automation technology to be unlocked.\n\n### Errors related to research timeout\n- Make sure you have all required ingredients for research before starting it. If you do not have enough items, the research will not proceed.\n\n### Errors when trying to craft copper plates\n- Ensure that you have a crafting machine or a furnace available to craft copper plates, as they cannot be crafted directly from inventory.\n\n### Errors related to inventory full\n- Check the inventory capacity of the furnace before attempting to insert items. If the furnace is full, you will not be able to insert more items until space is cleared."}
