{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnaces**:\n  - Furnace at position (-16.0, -49.0) fueled by coal, currently full of iron plates.\n  - Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) fueled by coal, actively working with iron ore.\n- **Inserters**:\n  - Inserter at position (-13.5, -47.5) with pickup at (-13.5, -48.5) and drop at (-13.5, -46.5).\n  - Inserter at position (-14.5, -45.5) with pickup at (-14.5, -46.5) and drop at (-14.5, -44.5).\n  - Inserter at position (-9.5, -44.5) with pickup at (-8.5, -44.5) and drop at (-10.5, -44.5).\n  - Inserter at position (-14.5, -43.5) with pickup at (-14.5, -44.5) and drop at (-14.5, -42.5).\n  - Inserter at position (-13.5, -45.5) with pickup at (-13.5, -46.5) and drop at (-13.5, -44.5).\n- **Chests**:\n  - Wooden chest at position (-13.5, -46.5) containing iron plates.\n  - Wooden chest at position (-13.5, -44.5) containing iron ore and iron plates.\n  - Iron chest at position (-11.5, -44.5) containing iron ore.\n- **Belt Groups**:\n  - Belt group connecting various positions for transporting materials between entities.\n  - Individual belts connecting furnaces and inserters for efficient material flow.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Output Blockage\n- Ensure that the destination for inserters is not blocked. Check that there is a sink entity or enough space for the inserter to drop items.\n\n### Errors when Inserters are Waiting for Space\n- Regularly check the destination inventory or connected belts to ensure they have space to accept items from inserters.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Verify that the source entity has items available for the inserter to pick up. Ensure the supply chain is consistent and materials are being fed into the system efficiently.\n\n### Errors with Belt Direction and Connectivity\n- Confirm that belts are correctly oriented and connected to transport items in the desired direction. Misaligned belts can disrupt the flow of materials."}
