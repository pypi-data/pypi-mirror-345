{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Setup at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nThis setup is designed for processing iron ore into iron plates. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and deposits it into the adjacent chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates, but currently not receiving iron ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities too far\n- Ensure you are within the maximum placement distance (10 tiles) when attempting to place entities. Move closer to the target position before placing.\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied tiles\n- Verify that the target tile is unoccupied before placing an entity. Consider adjusting the spacing, direction, or reference position to avoid collisions with existing entities.\n\n### Furnace not receiving iron ore\n- Check the alignment and operation of inserters to ensure they are correctly transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace. Ensure the inserter is fueled and properly positioned.\n\n### Inserter out of fuel\n- Regularly refuel inserters to maintain continuous operation and prevent them from stopping due to lack of fuel.\n\n### Chest full warning\n- Monitor the chest's inventory to prevent it from becoming full, which can halt the mining drill's operation. Regularly extract items to free up space.\n\n### Furnace lacks ingredients\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly positioned and operational to supply the furnace with the necessary iron ore for smelting."}
