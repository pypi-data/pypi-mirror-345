{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0): Extracts iron ore and deposits it into a chest. Currently fueled with coal and operational.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5): Stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill. Contains 3 units of iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the stone furnace. Currently out of fuel.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates. Currently lacks ingredients to smelt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Misalignment and Fuel Issues\n- Ensure the inserter is correctly aligned to transfer items between the chest and the furnace. Reposition if necessary.\n- Regularly refuel the burner inserter to maintain continuous operation. Monitor fuel levels to prevent stoppages.\n\n### Chest Overflow\n- Monitor the chest's capacity to prevent overflow. Extract excess iron ore periodically to free up space for continuous mining.\n\n### Furnace Input Issues\n- Verify that the furnace is receiving the necessary ingredients (iron ore) to operate. Check the inserter setup and ensure it is functioning correctly.\n\n### Mining Drill Fuel Management\n- Keep the mining drill fueled to ensure continuous extraction of resources. Harvest and stockpile coal to prevent fuel shortages."}
