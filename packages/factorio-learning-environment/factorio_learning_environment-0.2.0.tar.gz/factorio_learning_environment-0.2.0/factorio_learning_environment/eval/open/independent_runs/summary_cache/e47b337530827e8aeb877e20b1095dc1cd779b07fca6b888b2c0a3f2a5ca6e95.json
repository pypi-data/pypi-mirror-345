{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=1.5, y=23.0)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\n- Boiler at Position (x=1.5, y=23.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\n- Pipe connections between the boiler and steam engine, and from offshore pump to boiler\n\n### Pipe Systems\n- Steam Pipe Group: Connects the boiler to the steam engine, with pipes running from (x=3.5, y=17.5) to (x=10.5, y=21.5)\n- Water Pipe Group: Connects the offshore pump to the boiler, with pipes running from (x=-9.5, y=23.5) to (x=-0.5, y=23.5)\n\n### Electricity Network\n- Electricity Poles: Positioned at various coordinates including (x=27.5, y=26.5), (x=24.5, y=22.5), (x=16.5, y=24.5), etc., forming a network to distribute power.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors When Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure that the pipe connections between the boiler's steam output and the steam engine are correctly aligned and within range. Verify that the connection points are accessible and that there are no obstructions preventing the connection.\n\n### Errors When Using Connect Entities API\n- Double-check the parameters passed to the `connect_entities` function to ensure they refer to valid and existing entities. Confirm that the entities are correctly positioned and that the connection is feasible within the game mechanics."}
