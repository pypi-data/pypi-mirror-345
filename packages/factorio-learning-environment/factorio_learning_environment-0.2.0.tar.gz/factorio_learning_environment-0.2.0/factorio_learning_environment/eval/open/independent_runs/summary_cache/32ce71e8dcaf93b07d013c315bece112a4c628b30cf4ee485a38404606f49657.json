{"content": "## Report\n\n### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Coal Extraction and Storage at Position (41.5, -80.5)\n- **Entities:**\n  - Iron Chest at (41.5, -80.5) storing coal.\n  - Burner Inserter at (41.5, -78.5) waiting for source items.\n  - Additional Iron Chests at (44.5, -80.5), (45.5, -80.5), (47.5, -80.5), and (49.5, -80.5) storing coal and iron plates.\n\n#### Iron Ore Mining and Processing at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\n- **Entities:**\n  - Burner Mining Drill at (-15.0, -50.0) extracting iron ore.\n  - Iron Chest at (-16.5, -48.5) and Wooden Chest at (-14.5, -48.5) storing extracted iron ore.\n  - Stone Furnaces at (-13.0, -48.0), (-11.0, -48.0), and (-9.0, -48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n  - Wooden Chest at (-9.5, -49.5) storing iron ore.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors in Inserter Placement\n- Ensure that there is sufficient space and no existing entities at the target position before placing a burner-inserter. Adjust the spacing or direction if necessary.\n\n#### Errors in Refueling Entities\n- Verify the presence of the correct entity type at the specified position before attempting to refuel. Ensure that the entity is accessible and not obstructed by other entities.\n\n#### Errors Due to Inventory Full\n- Regularly check and manage inventory space to avoid failed extraction or placement actions due to a full inventory.\n\n#### Crafting Errors\n- Ensure all required materials are available before attempting to craft items to avoid crafting failures.\n\n#### General Placement Errors\n- Before placing any entity, confirm that the target tile is not occupied by another entity and that the placement is feasible given the current map conditions (e.g., not on water or obstructed by other items)."}
