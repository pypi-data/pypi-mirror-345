{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nThis structure is designed to produce iron plates from iron ore. It consists of the following entities:\n\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0): Extracts iron ore and deposits it into a chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5): Stores extracted iron ore and iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5): Transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the stone furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0): Smelts iron ore into iron plates.\n\nThis setup is designed to automate the process of extracting iron ore, transferring it to a furnace, and producing iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Fuel Management\n- Ensure that all entities requiring fuel, such as mining drills, inserters, and furnaces, have a sufficient supply of coal or another fuel source to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Alignment\n- Verify that inserters are correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items between entities. Misalignment can prevent the transfer of materials, halting production.\n\n### Errors with Inventory Management\n- Regularly check and manage the inventory of chests and furnaces to prevent overflow or lack of space, which can disrupt the production process.\n\n### Errors with Resource Availability\n- Ensure that there are enough raw materials available for processing. The furnace should always have a supply of iron ore to smelt into iron plates.\n\n### Errors with Entity Placement\n- Before placing entities, ensure that the target tile is unoccupied to avoid placement errors."}
