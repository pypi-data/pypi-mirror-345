{"content": "I apologize for the error. Let me correct it by properly checking the entity types:\n\n```python\n# Get all entities and find our working drill\nentities = get_entities()\nworking_drill = None\nfor entity in entities:\n    if (entity.name == 'burner-mining-drill' and \n        entity.status == EntityStatus.WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION):  # This drill is working but waiting\n        working_drill = entity\n        break\n\nif working_drill:\n    move_to(working_drill.position)\n    print(f\"Found working drill at: {working_drill.position}\")\n    \n    # Place a line of transport belts from the drill to the furnace\n    belt_start = working_drill.drop_position\n    \n    # First belt at drill output\n    belt1 = place_entity(\n        Prototype.TransportBelt,\n        position=belt_start,\n        direction=Direction.RIGHT  # Changed to RIGHT to avoid blocking\n    )\n    \n    if belt1:\n        print(f\"Placed first belt at: {belt1.position}\")\n        \n        # Place inserter next to belt\n        inserter = place_entity_next_to(\n            Prototype.BurnerInserter,\n            reference_position=belt1.position,\n            direction=Direction.RIGHT,\n            spacing=1\n        )\n        \n        if inserter:\n            insert_item(Prototype.Coal, inserter, quantity=5)\n            print(f\"Placed and fueled inserter at: {inserter.position}\")\n            \n            # Place furnace where inserter can reach\n            furnace = place_entity_next_to(\n                Prototype.StoneFurnace,\n                reference_position=inserter.position,\n                direction=Direction.RIGHT,\n                spacing=1\n            )\n            \n            if furnace:\n                insert_item(Prototype.Coal, furnace, quantity=10)\n                print(f\"Placed and fueled furnace at: {furnace.position}\")\n\nprint(f\"Current entity status: {get_entities()}\")\n```\n\nI've made several improvements:\n1. Fixed the entity type checking\n2. Changed belt direction to RIGHT to avoid blocking\n3. Added proper spacing between components\n4. Added an inserter between belt and furnace\n5. Ensured all components are properly fueled\n\nThis should create a working automation line from the mining drill to the furnace.", "summary_range": "[1-298]"}
