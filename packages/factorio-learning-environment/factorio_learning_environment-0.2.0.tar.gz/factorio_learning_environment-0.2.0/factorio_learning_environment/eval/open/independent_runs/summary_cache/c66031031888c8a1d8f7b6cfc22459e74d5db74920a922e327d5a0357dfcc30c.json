{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0): Used for smelting iron ore into iron plates. Currently working with a fuel inventory of coal.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=1.5, y=0.5): Transfers iron plates from the stone furnace to the wooden chest. It is fueled by coal and is currently working.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=2.5, y=0.5): Collects iron plates transferred by the burner inserter. Currently contains iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=4.5, y=0.5): Positioned to transfer items from a belt to a chest, but currently waiting for source items.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied spaces\n- Ensure there is no collision with existing entities before placing a new entity. Consider increasing the spacing, changing the direction, or changing the reference position if placement fails due to collisions.\n\n### Errors when connecting belts to incompatible entities\n- Belts cannot be directly connected to a wooden chest. Use an inserter to input items into the chest instead.\n\n### Errors due to lack of items in inventory\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to place or craft entities. For example, attempting to place a burner inserter without having it in the inventory will result in an error.\n\n### Errors when crafting without required materials\n- Verify that all required materials are available before attempting to craft an item. For instance, crafting transport belts requires iron plates, which must be available in the inventory or produced via smelting.\n\n### Errors when inserting items without inventory stock\n- Before inserting items into a structure, ensure that the items are available in your inventory to avoid insertion errors."}
