{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Electricity generator at position(117.5, -30.5)\nConsists of steam engine(position (117.5, -30.5)), boiler(position (111.5, -32.0)) and offshore pump (position (106.5, -32.5))\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(60.0, -60.0)\nConsists of following entities\n- Furnace at position (60.0, -60.0)\n\n### Pipe network at position(105.5, -32.5)\nConsists of following entities\n- PipeGroup at position (105.5, -32.5) with multiple pipes\n- PipeGroup at position (107.5, -34.5) with multiple pipes\n\n### Electricity network at position(111.5, -30.5)\nConsists of following entities\n- Small electric pole at position (111.5, -30.5)\n- Small electric pole at position (115.5, -30.5)\n- Small electric pole at position (120.5, -26.5)\n- Small electric pole at position (115.5, -32.5)\n- Small electric pole at position (111.5, -27.5)\n- Small electric pole at position (112.5, -24.5)\n\n### Belt network at position(63.5, -53.5)\nConsists of following entities\n- Belt at position (63.5, -53.5) with direction UP\n- Belt at position (64.5, -53.5) with direction UP\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n### Errors when accessing position attribute\n- Ensure that the position attribute is accessed correctly, as 'Position' object has no attribute 'position'. Instead, use the x and y coordinates directly.\n\n### Errors when using connect_entities function\n- Ensure that the connect_entities function is used with correct parameters, as 'float' object cannot be interpreted as an integer. Check the positions and entity types before connecting.\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure that the entity is placed at a valid position, and the position is not occupied by another entity.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n* Utility functions:\n\t+ connect_entities: connects two entities with a pipe\n\t+ get_entity: gets an entity by prototype and position\n* Important variables:\n\t+ offshore_pump: OffshorePump entity\n\t+ boiler: Boiler entity\n\t+ steam_engine: Generator entity\n\t+ Prototype.Pipe: Pipe prototype\n\t+ Position: position class with x and y coordinates"}
