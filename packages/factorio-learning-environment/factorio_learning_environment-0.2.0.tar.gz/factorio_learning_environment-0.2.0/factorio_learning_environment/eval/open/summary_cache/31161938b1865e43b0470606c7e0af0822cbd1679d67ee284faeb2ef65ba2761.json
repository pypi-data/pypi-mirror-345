{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron gear wheel production line at position around (16.0, 71.0) to (21.5, 73.5)\nConsists of the following connected entities forming a production chain:\n- Burner mining drill at position (16.0, 71.0) extracting iron ore, fueled by inserted coal.\n- Burner inserter at position (17.5, 71.5) transferring iron ore from the mining drill to the furnace.\n- Stone furnace at position (17.0, 73.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates, fueled by coal.\n- Burner inserter at position (23.5, 73.5) feeding iron plates into the assembling machine.\n- Assembling machine 2 at position (21.5, 73.5) set to craft iron gear wheels, currently without power.\n- Burner inserter at position (19.5, 73.5) intended to take iron gear wheels from the assembler.\n- Wooden chest at position (18.5, 73.5) to collect iron gear wheels from the output inserter.\n- Small electric poles at positions (21.5, 75.5) and (19.5, 75.5) intended to provide power to the assembler and inserters.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to placing assembling machine not in inventory\n- Ensure the correct assembling machine type is available in inventory before attempting placement.\n- Use assembling-machine-2 (which is in inventory) instead of assembling-machine-1 if the latter is not available.\n\n### Errors connecting transport belts directly from furnaces\n- Transport belts cannot be connected directly from a furnace entity.\n- Always use an inserter to extract items from the furnace, then connect belts from the inserter\u2019s drop position.\n\n### Errors placing burner inserter near furnace due to collisions\n- Placement attempts for burner inserters next to the furnace failed due to existing entities (wooden chest, other inserters, assembling machine) blocking the tiles.\n- Increase spacing, change direction, or reposition reference points to find free placement tiles.\n- Avoid placing entities overlapping or adjacent to already occupied tiles.\n\n### Errors due to assembler not receiving power\n- Despite placing electric poles near the assembler, it remains unpowered.\n- Verify electric poles are properly connected and within power supply range.\n- Confirm poles are connected to a power source (steam engine, solar, or accumulator) to energize the network.\n\n### Errors extracting items from empty or incorrect chests\n- Extraction from the wooden chest failed because it contained no iron gear wheels.\n- Ensure items are present in the chest before attempting extraction.\n- Confirm correct chest entity and coordinates are targeted for extraction.\n\n### General fuel-related warnings and errors\n- Burner mining drill, furnace, and burner inserters show warnings about being out of fuel.\n- Keep fuel supplied to all burner-type entities to maintain operation.\n- Automate or manually insert coal to avoid stoppages.\n\nNAMESPACE\nNo user-defined functions have been declared in the provided steps."}
