Check the inventory and supply chain to avoid running out of materials.\n\n### Errors related to power supply\n- Ensure that the lab and other entities requiring power are connected to an active electricity network. Check the connections and power sources.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors when placing entities too far away\n- Move closer to the target position before attempting to place an entity. The maximum placement distance is 10 tiles."}
