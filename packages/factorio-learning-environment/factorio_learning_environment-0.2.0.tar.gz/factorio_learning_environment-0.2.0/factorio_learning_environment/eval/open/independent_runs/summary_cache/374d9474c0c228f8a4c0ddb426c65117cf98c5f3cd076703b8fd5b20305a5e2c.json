{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Furnace at position(0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position (0, 0)) with a fuel inventory containing coal and a result inventory containing copper-plates. The furnace is currently not smelting due to lack of ingredients.\n\n### Chest at position(2.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest (position (2.5, 0.5)) with an inventory containing copper-plates.\n\n### Copper plate factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (0, 0) that produces copper plates.\n- Chest at position (2.5, 0.5) that stores copper plates.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n- **Errors when crafting items due to missing ingredients**\n  - Ensure that the required ingredients (in this case, copper plates) are available in the inventory or in a connected structure before attempting to craft items. The crafting process requires a crafting machine or smelting in a furnace.\n\n- **Errors when transferring items to the chest**\n  - Verify that there are items available in the inventory to transfer to the chest. If the inventory is empty or the item type does not match, the transfer will fail.\n\n- **Errors related to furnace operation**\n  - Check that the furnace has the necessary ingredients to smelt. If the furnace is reporting \"no ingredients to smelt,\" ensure that the required raw materials are present.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions Defined:**\n  - `craft_item(Prototype.AutomationSciencePack)`: This function has failed multiple times due to missing copper plates.\n  \n- **Important Variables Assigned:**\n  - `current_inventory`: dict\n  - `chest_inventory`: dict\n  - `furnace_inventory`: dict\n  - `furnace`: object (stone-furnace)\n  - `chest`: object (wooden-chest)"}
