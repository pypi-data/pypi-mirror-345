{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Plate Production Facility at position (x=2.0, y=-63.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner mining drill** at position (x=2.0, y=-63.0) extracting iron ore.\n- **Stone furnace** at position (x=4.0, y=-63.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner inserter** at position (x=3.5, y=-61.5) transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Wooden chest** at position (x=2.5, y=-61.5) storing iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Wooden chest** at position (x=4.5, y=-61.5) storing iron plates (currently empty).\n\n#### Coal Mining Operation at position (x=40.5, y=-82.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner mining drill** at position (x=40.5, y=-82.5) extracting coal.\n\n---\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when extracting items from a furnace with no output\n- Ensure the furnace has produced the required item (e.g., iron plates) before attempting to extract. Check the furnace's output inventory before extraction.\n\n#### Errors when the furnace runs out of fuel\n- Regularly check the fuel levels in furnaces and drills. Add coal or other fuel sources to keep the smelting process running.\n\n#### Errors when the inserter has no source items\n- Ensure the inserter has access to items to transfer. Verify that the source chest or entity contains the required items.\n\n#### Errors when the chest is full\n- Avoid overfilling chests by either expanding storage or automating item transfer to other storage or production facilities.\n\n#### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Always check if a tile is occupied before placing an entity. Use the `can_place_entity` API to verify tile availability.\n\n#### Errors when extracting from an entity that does not contain the item\n- Verify the entity's inventory contains the item before attempting extraction. Use the `get_inventory` API to check the contents.\n\n#### Errors when the furnace has no ingredients to smelt\n- Ensure the furnace has both fuel and the required ingredients (e.g., iron ore) before attempting to smelt. Check the furnace's input inventory and fuel levels.\n\n#### Errors when the inserter is waiting for source items\n- Ensure the inserter has access to the source items. Verify that the source chest or entity contains the required items and is not empty.\n\n#### Errors when the chest is empty\n- Ensure the chest is not empty before attempting to extract items. Verify the chest's inventory before extraction.\n\n#### Errors when the furnace is out of fuel\n- Regularly check the fuel levels in furnaces and drills. Add coal or other fuel sources to keep the smelting process running."}
