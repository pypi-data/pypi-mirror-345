{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nNo structures have been successfully created on the map. All attempts to place entities have failed, resulting in an empty map.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Placing Entities\n- **Cannot Place Wooden Chest**: Ensure the target position is not occupied or obstructed before attempting to place a wooden chest. Positions attempted include x=0.0 y=0.0, x=50.0 y=50.0, x=95.0 y=95.0, x=200.0 y=200.0, and others.\n- **Cannot Place Stone Furnace**: Verify that the placement area for stone furnaces is clear and suitable for the entity. Positions attempted include x=5.0 y=0.0, x=53.0 y=50.0, x=100.0 y=95.0, x=203.0 y=200.0, and others.\n- **Cannot Place Inserters and Output Chests**: Ensure that the positions for inserters and output chests are valid and not blocked. Positions attempted include ore inserter at x=1.0 y=0.0, plate inserter at x=6.0 y=0.0, and output chest at x=7.0 y=0.0, among others.\n\n### Errors in Moving\n- **Error Moving to Area**: Correct the usage of the `move_to` function. Ensure that the position argument is correctly formatted as an integer index rather than a string. Errors occurred when moving to various areas, such as the Wooden Chest area and Stone Furnace area.\n\n### General Programming Errors\n- **String Indices Must Be Integers**: When accessing elements in a string or list, ensure that indices are integers. This error was encountered during movement operations.\n- **'Position' Object is Not Callable**: Review the code to ensure that 'Position' objects are not mistakenly used as functions. This error was encountered during movement operations to various areas.\n\nBy addressing these errors, the agent can improve its ability to place entities and navigate the map effectively."}
