{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0) for smelting iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (1.5, 0.5) transferring iron plates from the furnace to a chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (2.5, 0.5) storing iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (3.5, 0.5) transferring items from the chest to a transport belt.\n- **Transport Belt** from position (3.5, 0.5) to (5.5, 0.5) moving items along the line.\n\n### Copper Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnace** at position (10.0, 0.0) for smelting copper ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (8.5, 0.5) transferring copper plates from the furnace to a chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (7.5, 0.5) storing copper plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (6.5, 0.5) transferring items from the transport belt to the chest.\n- **Transport Belt** from position (5.5, 0.5) to (6.5, 0.5) moving items along the line.\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (41.0, -82.0) extracting coal.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (40.5, -83.5) storing extracted coal.\n- **Transport Belt** from position (40.5, -83.5) to (38.5, -83.5) for moving coal.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing. This will prevent errors such as \"Could not place a wooden chest at x=14.0 y=0.5.\"\n\n### Errors when extracting from non-existent or incorrect entities\n- Verify the existence and contents of an entity before attempting to extract items. This will prevent errors like \"Could not extract coal from wooden-chest at (40.5, -83.5): Could not find a valid wooden-chest entity containing coal.\"\n\n### Errors due to inserters waiting for source items\n- Ensure that the source entities for inserters are adequately stocked with items to prevent inserters from being idle.\n\n### Errors due to furnaces lacking ingredients\n- Regularly supply furnaces with the necessary ores to ensure continuous production and avoid warnings such as \"no ingredients to smelt.\""}
