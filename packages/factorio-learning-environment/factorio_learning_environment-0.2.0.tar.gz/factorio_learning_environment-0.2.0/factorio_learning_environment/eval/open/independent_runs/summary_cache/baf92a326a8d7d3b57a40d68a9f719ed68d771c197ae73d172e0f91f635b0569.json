{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll generate a comprehensive report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining System at (-82.0, 41.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0) facing DOWN\n- Wooden chest at (41.5, -80.5)\n- Burner inserter at (42.5, -80.5) facing RIGHT\n  - Pickup position: (41.5, -80.5)\n  - Drop position: (43.5, -80.5)\n\nThe system is partially functional:\n- Mining drill is working and fueled (46 coal)\n- Chest is collecting coal (383 coal stored)\n- Inserter is fueled but waiting for space in destination\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Conflicts\n- Always verify target position is clear before placing entities\n- When placing connected structures, ensure proper spacing between components\n- Clean up existing entities in the target area before attempting new placements\n\n### Furnace Placement Issues\n- Ensure furnace input position aligns exactly with inserter drop position\n- When placing furnaces, account for their 2x2 size and verify all tiles are free\n- Check for terrain restrictions (water, cliffs) before attempting placement\n\n### System Design\n- Plan the complete layout before placing components\n- Consider the working area of each entity (pickup/drop positions)\n- Maintain proper spacing between components to avoid overlap\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nFunctions:\n- `place_entity_next_to(entity_type, reference_position, spacing, direction)`: Places an entity adjacent to a reference position\n  - Failures: Existing entities blocking placement\n  - Success: When target position is clear and valid\n\nVariables:\n- `inserter`: BurnerInserter type\n- `furnace`: StoneFurnace type\n- `mining_drill`: BurnerMiningDrill type\n\nThe agent is attempting to build a coal processing system but is struggling with proper component placement and spacing. The main challenge appears to be coordinating the inserter's drop position with the furnace input position."}
