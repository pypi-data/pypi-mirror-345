The furnace is currently smelting copper plates but is limited by fuel.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(-15, -50)\nConsists of a burner mining drill at position (-15.0, -50.0), a burner inserter at position (-14.5, -51.5), and a wooden chest at position (-15.5, -51.5). The inserter transfers mined iron ore from the drill to the chest. The drill is currently mining iron ore, but the chest is filling up. There is also a burner inserter at position (-13.5, -49.5) which is trying to insert items into a steel chest at position (-12.5, -49.5)\n\n### Chest storage area near copper mine\nConsists of multiple chests at the following locations:\n- steel-chest at (-14.5, -66.5)\n- iron-chest at (-14.5, -57.5)\n- wooden-chest at (-14.5, -52.5)\n- iron-chest at (-26.5, -49.5)\n- wooden-chest at (-25.5, -49.5)\n- iron-chest at (-24.5, -49.5)\n- iron-chest at (-22.5, -49.5)\n- iron-chest at (-23.5, -49.5)\n- iron-chest at (-21.5, -49.5)\n- wooden-chest at (-20.5, -49.5)\n- iron-chest at (-18.5, -49.5)\n- iron-chest at (-19.5, -49.5)\n- steel-chest at (-12.5, -49.5)\n- iron-chest at (-11.5, -49.5)\n- wooden-chest at (-14.5, -47.5)\n- iron-chest at (-14.5, -46.5)\n- iron-chest at (-14.5, -45.5)\n- iron-chest at (-14.5, -42.5)\n- iron-chest at (-14.5, -43.5)\n- wooden-chest at (-14.5, -38.5)\n- wooden-chest at (-13.5, -39.5)\n- steel-chest at (-14.5, -34.5)\n\n### Belt network\nConsists of multiple belt groups connecting different locations:\n- A belt group with input at (37.5, -83.5) and output at (-11.5, -47.5)\n- A belt group with input at (45.5, -83.5) and output at (45.5, -81.5)\n- A belt group with input at (4.5, -73.5) and output at (4.5, -71.5)\n- A belt group with input at (-15.5, -55.5) and output at (-15.5, -53.5)\n- A belt group with input at (-17.5, -51.5) and output at (-15.5, -39.5)\n- A belt group with input at (-7.5, -48.5) and output at (10.5, -48.5)\nAnd some individual belts at the following locations:\n- (41.5, -85.5)\n- (38.5, -82.5)\n- (39.5, -83.5)\n- (41.5, -83.5)\n- (40.5, -81.5)\n- (45.5, -80.5)\n- (37.5, -74.5)\n- (-20.5, -50.5)\n- (-20.5, -48.5)\n- (-16.5, -46.5)\n- (-12.5, -46.5)\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using"}
