{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron gear wheel production structure near position (16.0, 71.0)\nConsists of the following connected entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (16.0, 71.0) extracting iron ore\n- Burner inserter at position (17.5, 71.5) moving ore from the drill\n- Stone furnace at position (17.0, 73.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates\n- Burner inserter at position (14.5, 73.5) extracting iron plates from the furnace onto belts\n- Transport belts connecting furnace output inserter at (13.5, 73.5) to assembler input inserter at (24.5, 73.5)\n- Assembling machine 2 at position (21.5, 73.5) set to craft iron gear wheels\n- Burner inserter at position (23.5, 73.5) feeding iron plates into the assembler\n- Burner inserter at position (19.5, 73.5) taking iron gear wheels from the assembler\n- Wooden chest at position (18.5, 73.5) collecting iron gear wheels\n- Small electric poles at positions (14.5, 72.5) and (21.5, 75.5) connected to power the assembler and inserters\n\nThis structure forms a basic iron gear wheel production line from ore extraction to gear wheel output collection.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to placing entities where space is occupied\n- Multiple attempts to place burner inserters next to the furnace failed because the target tiles were occupied by a wooden chest or another inserter. To avoid this, verify the target tile is free before placement or increase spacing and adjust direction accordingly.\n- Attempt to place a small electric pole at (14.5, 75.5) failed due to obstruction. Always check for existing entities or obstacles before placing poles.\n\n### Errors connecting transport belts directly from furnaces\n- Transport belts cannot be connected directly from a stone furnace entity. Instead, use an inserter to extract items from the furnace and connect belts to the inserter\u2019s output position.\n\n### Errors due to missing inventory items\n- Attempted to place assembling-machine-1 failed because it was not present in inventory. Ensure the required entity prototype is available in inventory before placement.\n\n### Power supply issues\n- The assembling machine 2 was not receiving power despite poles being placed and connected. This indicates incomplete or incorrect power pole network connections. Verify that all electric poles are properly connected and cover the assembler\u2019s position.\n- Assertion failure due to assembler energy being zero highlights the need to confirm power availability before operation.\n\n### Entity search failures\n- Could not find nearest steam engine on the surface. This suggests no steam engines have been placed yet or the search parameters need adjustment. Place steam engines before attempting to reference them.\n\nNAMESPACE\nNo user-defined functions have been declared in the provided steps."}
