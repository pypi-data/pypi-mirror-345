Remove any existing entities if necessary.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient inventory\n- Verify that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to place an entity. Craft or acquire more items if needed.\n\n### Errors when placing entities over water\n- Avoid placing entities on water tiles. Ensure the target location is suitable for placement by checking the terrain.\n\n### Incorrect API Usage\n- Ensure you are using the correct attribute names in the API. For example, use 'PipeGroup' instead of 'PipeToGround' when referring to pipe systems."}
