{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-47.5, -123.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting the Offshore Pump to other entities, starting at position (-47.5, -122.5)\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -76.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-15.5, -77.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -73.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n- Stone Furnace at position (9.0, -64.0) producing iron plates\n- Stone Furnace at position (6.0, -62.0) producing iron plates\n- Wooden Chest at position (7.5, -61.5) storing iron plates\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) not receiving electricity, intended to move items from the Wooden Chest to another entity\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of:\n- Small Electric Poles distributed across various positions, including (-36.5, -76.5), (-35.5, -77.5), (-32.5, -76.5), etc.\n\n### Pipe Network\nMultiple PipeGroups with various fluid systems and statuses, connecting different parts of the map:\n- PipeGroup at position (-47.5, -122.5) with water\n- Several other PipeGroups at positions such as (-35.5, -122.5), (-44.5, -116.5), and more, mostly empty\n\n### Laboratory\n- Lab with input of automation science packs, located within the electricity network but currently without power\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Using Attributes of Entities\n- Ensure that the correct attributes are being accessed for each entity type. For example, 'PipeGroup' does not have a 'prototype' attribute.\n\n### Errors when Removing Entities\n- When removing an entity, ensure that the function arguments are correct. If the first argument is an Entity object, the second argument must be None.\n\n### Errors Related to Power Supply\n- Ensure that all entities requiring electricity, such as inserters and labs, are connected to a powered electric network to avoid 'no power' warnings.\n\n### Errors Related to Fuel Supply\n- Ensure that burner mining drills and furnaces have sufficient fuel to operate, as indicated by 'out of fuel' warnings.\n\n### Errors Related to Inventory Management\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are full to prevent mining operations from halting due to full storage."}
