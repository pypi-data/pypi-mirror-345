{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining Setup at (-41, -82)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0) mining coal\n- Wooden chest at (41.5, -80.5) collecting coal\n- Burner inserter at (42.5, -80.5) moving coal from chest\n- Transport belt at (43.5, -80.5) receiving coal from inserter\n- Stone furnace at (46.0, -80.0)\n\nThe setup is currently partially working:\n- Mining drill is operational and mining coal\n- Chest is collecting coal (628 units stored)\n- Inserter is blocked due to full belt\n- Furnace has no ingredients but has fuel\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Conflicts\n- When placing multiple entities in sequence, ensure proper spacing between them to avoid placement conflicts\n- Check if target location is clear before attempting to place entities\n- Consider the size of entities (e.g. furnaces are 2x2, belts are 1x1) when planning layouts\n\n### Belt System Issues\n- Transport belts are getting blocked, causing upstream inserters to stop working\n- Ensure belts have a clear path to output their items\n- Consider adding more belts to extend the transport line or ensure items are being removed from the belt\n\n# NAMESPACE\n\n### Functions\nNo explicit functions defined in provided logs\n\n### Important Variables\n- `belt`: TransportBelt\n- `belt2`: TransportBelt  \n- `furnace`: Furnace\n\n### Entity States\n- Mining drill fuel level: 23 coal\n- Chest inventory: 628 coal\n- Inserter fuel level: 47 coal\n- Furnace fuel level: 50 coal"}
