{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron plate production setup at position around (16.0, 71.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (16.0, 71.0), facing down, actively mining iron ore.\n- Stone furnace at position (16.0, 73.0), used for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden chest at position (17.5, 73.5), collecting iron plates from the furnace.\n- Burner inserter at position (18.5, 73.5), oriented right, transferring iron plates from the furnace to the wooden chest.\n\nThis structure forms a compact iron plate production line where iron ore is mined, smelted, and output is collected in a chest. The inserter is intended to move iron plates from furnace to chest but currently suffers from fuel shortages.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter placement conflicts\n- When placing inserters next to furnaces or chests, ensure the target tile is not already occupied by another entity (e.g., wooden chest or furnace).\n- Increase spacing, change direction, or adjust reference position when placing inserters to avoid overlapping existing entities.\n\n### Fuel management for burner inserters and furnaces\n- Burner inserters and furnaces require continuous fuel supply (coal) to operate. Inserters without fuel cannot pick up or insert items, causing production stalls.\n- Always verify sufficient coal is inserted into burner inserters and furnaces to maintain operation.\n- Track fuel inventory carefully to avoid running out, and implement logic to replenish fuel before depletion.\n\n### Variable definition and usage errors\n- Avoid using undefined variables such as 'extracted_ore'. Ensure variables are declared and assigned before use to prevent runtime exceptions.\n- Use consistent variable names and check for typos or scope issues in code.\n\n### Inventory and insertion errors\n- Ensure the inventory contains the required items before attempting to insert them into entities.\n- Handle cases where the inventory is empty to prevent insertion failures and exceptions.\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nNo user-defined functions have been declared in the provided steps."}
