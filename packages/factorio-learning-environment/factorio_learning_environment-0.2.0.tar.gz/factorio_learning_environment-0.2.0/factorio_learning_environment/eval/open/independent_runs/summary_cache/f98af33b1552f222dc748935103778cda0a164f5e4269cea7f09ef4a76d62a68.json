{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -48.0), (-13.0, -48.0), and (-11.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -48.0) fueled by coal, currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0) fueled by coal, currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0) fueled by coal, currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (4.0, -60.0) extracting iron ore, with a drop position at (4.5, -58.5). The chest at the drop position is full, preventing further mining.\n- Wooden Chest at position (4.5, -58.5) storing extracted iron ore.\n- Multiple Wooden Chests at various positions storing iron plates, some of which are full.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Full Storage Chests\n- Ensure that storage chests are regularly emptied to prevent mining and production processes from halting due to full inventories.\n\n### Errors with Furnaces Lacking Ingredients\n- Regularly check and supply necessary ingredients to furnaces to maintain continuous production.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined in the provided steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `iron-ore`: int, currently 100 in inventory.\n- `iron-plate`: int, currently 3054 in inventory.\n- `iron-gear-wheel`: int, currently 4 in inventory.\n- `wood`: int, currently 10 in inventory. \n\nThis report summarizes the current state of the agent's structures and provides guidance on addressing encountered errors."}
