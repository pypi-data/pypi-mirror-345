{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (0.5, 28.0)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-3.5, 27.5)\n- Boiler at Position (0.5, 28.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (7.5, 39.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing Facility at Position (40.0, -84.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (40.0, -84.0)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (40.5, -82.5) for coal storage\n- Wooden Chest at Position (41.5, -83.5) (currently empty)\n- BeltGroup transporting coal from the mining drill to the processing area\n\n### Iron Plate Storage\nConsists of:\n- Iron Chest at Position (0.5, 0.5) containing iron plates\n- Additional Iron Chests at Positions (1.5, 0.5) and (2.5, 0.5) (currently empty)\n\n### Copper Plate Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-15.0, -49.0) with a warning of no ingredients to smelt\n\n### Laboratory\n- Lab with input for automation science packs, currently not powered\n\n### Electricity Network\n- Small Electric Poles connecting various entities, currently not providing power\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Power Supply\n- Ensure that all components of the electricity network are connected properly to provide power to entities like the lab and steam engine.\n\n### Errors with Full Storage\n- Regularly check storage entities like chests to ensure they are not full, which can halt production processes. For instance, the chest at Position (40.5, -82.5) is full, preventing further mining.\n\n### Errors with No Ingredients\n- Ensure that all processing entities like furnaces have the necessary ingredients to operate. The stone furnace at Position (-15.0, -49.0) currently lacks ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Errors with Fluid Connections\n- Verify that all fluid connections are properly established to ensure the steam engine receives the necessary input liquid."}
