{"content": "The errors indicate two main issues: missing materials for crafting an offshore pump and attempting to place it from too far away. Let's address these step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Gather Required Materials\n\nThe offshore pump requires:\n- 1 Iron Gear Wheel\n- 2 Electronic Circuits\n- 1 Pipe\n\n#### Gathering Materials:\n1. **Iron Gear Wheel**: Craft from iron plates if available.\n2. **Electronic Circuit**: Craft from copper cables and iron plates.\n3. **Pipe**: Craft from iron plates.\n\nHere's how you can gather and craft these items:\n\n```python\n# Check current inventory\ninventory = inspect_inventory()\n\n# Craft Iron Gear Wheel if missing\nif inventory.get('iron-gear-wheel', 0) < 1:\n    if inventory.get('iron-plate', 0) >= 2:\n        craft_item(Prototype.IronGearWheel)\n    else:\n        print(\"Insufficient iron plates for crafting iron gear wheel.\")\n\n# Craft Electronic Circuit if missing\nif inventory.get('electronic-circuit', 0) < 2:\n    if inventory.get('copper-cable', 0) >= 3 and inventory.get('iron-plate', 0) >= 1:\n        craft_item(Prototype.ElectronicCircuit)\n    else:\n        print(\"Insufficient materials for crafting electronic circuits.\")\n\n# Craft Pipe if missing\nif inventory.get('pipe', 0) < 1:\n    if inventory.get('iron-plate', 0) >= 1:\n        craft_item(Prototype.Pipe)\n    else:\n        print(\"Insufficient iron plates for crafting pipe.\")\n\n# Re-check inventory after crafting\ninventory = inspect_inventory()\nprint(\"Updated inventory: \", inventory)\n```\n\n### Step 2: Move Closer to the Water Source\n\nEnsure you are within the placement range for the offshore pump:\n\n```python\n# Move closer to the water source\nwater_position = nearest(Resource.Water)\nmove_to(water_position)\n\n# Check if you are within range\ncurrent_position = get_player_position()\ndistance_to_water = calculate_distance(current_position, water_position)\nprint(f\"Distance to water: {distance_to_water}\")\n\nif distance_to_water <= 10:\n    # Place the offshore pump\n    offshore_pump = place_entity(Prototype.OffshorePump, position=water_position)\n    assert offshore_pump, \"Failed to place offshore pump.\"\nelse:\n    print(\"Move closer to the water source to place the offshore pump.\")\n```\n\n### Step 3: Continue with Power Setup\n\nOnce the offshore pump is placed, continue with placing the boiler and steam engine as previously described.\n\n### Tips:\n- Always ensure you have the necessary materials before attempting to craft.\n- Use `move_to()` to get within the required range for placing entities.\n- Check inventory frequently to ensure you have the right resources.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to craft the offshore pump and set up the power network successfully.", "summary_range": "[1-138]"}
