{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nLocated at positions around x=-16.0, y=-49.0 and x=-14.0, y=-49.0, this facility is responsible for producing iron plates. It consists of:\n- Two stone furnaces at positions (x=-16.0, y=-49.0) and (x=-14.0, y=-49.0) which are fueled by coal.\n- Multiple burner inserters positioned at (x=-13.5, y=-47.5), (x=-14.5, y=-45.5), (x=-9.5, y=-44.5), and (x=-14.5, y=-43.5) that are responsible for moving items between entities.\n- A wooden chest at position (x=-13.5, y=-46.5) and an iron chest at position (x=-11.5, y=-44.5) for storing iron plates.\n- Transport belts connecting these entities to facilitate the movement of items.\n\n### Transport Belt Network\nThis network connects various entities to streamline the production process:\n- BeltGroup connecting from (x=-11.5, y=-46.5) to (x=-9.5, y=-46.5) in the right direction.\n- BeltGroup connecting from (x=-12.5, y=-44.5) to (x=-12.5, y=-46.5) in the up direction.\n- Additional belts connecting various positions to ensure smooth flow of materials.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the inserters have access to the necessary source items. This can be achieved by checking the supply chain and ensuring that all necessary resources are available upstream.\n\n### Errors with Insufficient Inventory for Insertion\n- Before attempting to insert items into a furnace or other entities, verify that the required items are available in your inventory. Regularly monitor inventory levels to prevent such errors.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Blocked by Items on the Ground\n- Ensure that there is a clear path for inserters to place items into the destination. Avoid placing items on the ground where they can block inserters.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Space in Destination\n- Make sure that the destination entity has enough space to accommodate the items being inserted. Regularly clear out or manage inventory in destination entities to avoid blockage."}
