{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0), responsible for extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5), used for storing iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5), intended to transfer iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0), intended for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied tiles\n- Ensure that the target tile is free from other entities before attempting to place a new entity. Consider increasing spacing, changing direction, or adjusting the reference position to avoid collisions.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient resources\n- Verify that you have the required resources in your inventory before attempting to insert items into entities. This will prevent errors related to missing resources.\n\n### Errors in inserter setup\n- Double-check the alignment and positioning of inserters to ensure they are correctly transferring items between entities. Misaligned inserters may not function as expected, leading to resource bottlenecks."}
