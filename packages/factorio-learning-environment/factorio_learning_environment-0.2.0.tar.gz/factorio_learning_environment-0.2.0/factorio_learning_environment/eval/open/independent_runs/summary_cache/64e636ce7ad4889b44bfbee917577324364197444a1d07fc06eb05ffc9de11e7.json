{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position(-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (position -15.0, -50.0) which is currently working and extracting iron ore from the nearby wooden chest at position (-14.5, -48.5). The drill is refueled with coal.\n\n### Wooden Chest at position(-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of:\n- Wooden chest (position -14.5, -48.5) that contains iron ore (78 units). It is currently full, which is causing a warning for the burner mining drill.\n\n### Stone Furnace at position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace (position 0.0, 0.0) that is currently working and processing iron ore into iron plates. It has coal as fuel and is producing iron plates (69 units).\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n- Errors when using the burner mining drill while the chest is full:\n  - Ensure to empty the wooden chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) to allow the burner mining drill to continue extracting iron ore.\n  \n- Errors related to repeated actions without changes:\n  - Avoid unnecessary refueling or extraction actions if the entities are already in the desired state. Check the status of the burner mining drill and the wooden chest before repeating actions.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- Functions defined:\n  - None specified in the execution logs.\n\n- Important variables:\n  - `burner_mining_drill`: Entity (type: BurnerMiningDrill)\n  - `wooden_chest`: Entity (type: Chest)\n  - `stone_furnace`: Entity (type: Furnace)\n  - `iron_ore_count`: Integer (type: 78)\n  - `iron_plate_count`: Integer (type: 69)\n  - `coal_count`: Integer (type: 3)"}
