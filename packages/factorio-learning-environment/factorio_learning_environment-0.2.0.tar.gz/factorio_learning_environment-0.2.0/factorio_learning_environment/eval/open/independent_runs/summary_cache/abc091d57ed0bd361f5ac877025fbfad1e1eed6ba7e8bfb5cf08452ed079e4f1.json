{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Setup at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and is fueled by coal.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-15.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the stone furnace. Currently misaligned with the chest.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates but not receiving ore due to inserter misalignment.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Inserter Alignment\n- Ensure that the inserter's pickup position aligns correctly with the chest's position to enable the transfer of items. The pickup position should match the chest's position exactly.\n\n### Inserter Fueling Issues\n- Make sure the inserter has sufficient fuel to operate. Check inventory for available coal before attempting to refuel the inserter.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Ingredients\n- Verify that the inserter is correctly aligned and operational to transfer iron ore from the chest to the furnace. This requires both proper alignment and sufficient fuel in the inserter.\n\n### Coal Insertion Errors\n- Ensure that there is coal available in the inventory before attempting to insert it into entities that require fuel."}
