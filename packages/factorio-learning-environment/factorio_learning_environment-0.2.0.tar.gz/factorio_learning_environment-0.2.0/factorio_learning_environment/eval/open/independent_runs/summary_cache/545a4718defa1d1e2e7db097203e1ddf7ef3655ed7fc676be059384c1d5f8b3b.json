{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generation System at Position (x=20.5, y=-4.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Offshore Pump** at position (x=19.5, y=-1.5), supplying water.\n- **Pipe Group** connecting the offshore pump to the boiler, positions include (x=18.5, y=-3.5), (x=18.5, y=-2.5), (x=19.5, y=-2.5).\n- **Boiler** at position (x=20.5, y=-4.0), converting water to steam.\n- **Steam Engine** at position (x=22.5, y=-7.5), generating electricity.\n- **Electricity Group** with poles at various positions including (x=21.5, y=-14.5), (x=10.5, y=-10.5), (x=16.5, y=-13.5), (x=24.5, y=-7.5), ensuring power distribution.\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=2.0, y=0.0), producing copper plates.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=5.0, y=5.0), producing copper plates.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0), producing iron plates.\n\n### Research Lab at Position (x=unknown)\n- **Lab** with input of automation science packs, currently not powered.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Boiler Not Working\n- Ensure that the boiler is correctly connected to the steam engine and receiving water and fuel. Verify that all connections are secure and that the boiler is operational.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
