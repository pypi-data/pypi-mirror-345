{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (10.5, 34.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (10.5, 34.5)\n- Boiler at Position (0.5, 27.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-7.5, 25.5)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (0.5, 30.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting various positions for fluid transport\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (15.0, 0.0)\n- Inserters at Positions (16.5, 0.5) and (17.5, 0.5)\n- Wooden Chests at Positions (5.5, 0.5) and (18.5, 0.5)\n\n### Pipe Network\nConsists of multiple PipeGroups connecting various positions for fluid transport, including:\n- PipeGroup at Position (-14.5, 14.5)\n- PipeGroup at Position (-14.5, 17.5)\n- PipeGroup at Position (-12.5, 18.5)\n- PipeGroup at Position (-11.5, 19.5)\n- PipeGroup at Position (-12.5, 21.5)\n- PipeGroup at Position (-9.5, 23.5)\n- PipeGroup at Position (-7.5, 24.5)\n- PipeGroup at Position (1.5, 29.5)\n- PipeGroup at Position (5.5, 31.5)\n- PipeGroup at Position (8.5, 34.5)\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of:\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at various positions, including (x=-16.5, y=25.5), (x=-12.5, y=24.5), (x=19.5, y=26.5), etc.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities Too Far\n- Make sure to move closer to the target position before attempting to place an entity. The maximum distance allowed is 10 units.\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities on Occupied or Unplaceable Tiles\n- Ensure the target position is free from obstructions or unplaceable terrain like water before placing an entity.\n\n### Errors when Connecting Pipes\n- Verify that there are no blockages or incorrect placements preventing the connection of pipes between entities.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Inventory Items\n- Ensure you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities.\n\n### Errors with Unconnected Entities\n- Check that all entities, especially those in the electricity and fluid systems, are properly connected to their respective networks to function correctly."}
