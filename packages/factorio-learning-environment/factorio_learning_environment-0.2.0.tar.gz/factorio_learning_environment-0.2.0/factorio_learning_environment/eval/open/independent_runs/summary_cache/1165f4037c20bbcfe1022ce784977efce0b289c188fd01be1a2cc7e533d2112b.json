{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Transport System at Position (x=40.0, y=-84.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=40.0, y=-84.0), which is currently waiting for space in the destination due to items blocking the output.\n- Transport Belts connecting various positions to facilitate the movement of mined coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=40.5, y=-82.5), which moves items from the mining drill to a wooden chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=40.5, y=-81.5) for storing mined coal.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-15.0, y=-49.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates. Currently, it has no ingredients to smelt.\n- Belt Groups and Transport Belts facilitating the movement of resources to and from the furnace.\n\n### Item Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=41.5, y=-80.5) transferring items from a wooden chest at position (x=40.5, y=-81.5) to another wooden chest at position (x=42.5, y=-80.5).\n\n### Various Belt Groups\n- Multiple belt groups are present, connecting various points for efficient transportation of resources across the map.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Rotation\n- Ensure that inserters are correctly oriented to drop items into the intended containers. Repeated rotations suggest frequent misalignment.\n\n### Errors with Output Blockage\n- Regularly check and clear items blocking the output of mining drills to prevent production halts.\n\n### Errors with Full Chests\n- Monitor chest inventories to prevent them from becoming full, which can cause inserters to stop functioning.\n\n### Errors with Missing Ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to continue production. Regularly supply them with required resources to avoid production downtime."}
