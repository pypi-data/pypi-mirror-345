{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Automation Science Pack Production Line (around x=8.5, y=13.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine 1 at x=8.5 y=13.5\n- Iron gear input:\n  - Wooden chest at x=8.5 y=10.5 (contains iron gears)\n  - Burner inserter at x=8.5 y=11.5 (moves gears to assembler)\n- Output handling:\n  - Burner inserter at x=10.5 y=13.5\n  - Wooden chest at x=11.5 y=13.5 (for finished science packs)\n- Power connection via small electric pole at x=8.5 y=15.5\n\n### Power Generation System (around x=-4.5, y=12.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam engine at x=-4.5 y=12.5\n- Boiler at x=-4.5 y=16.0 (contains coal fuel)\n- Offshore pump at x=-3.5 y=27.5\n- Connected by pipe networks:\n  - Steam system (ID 3032)\n  - Water system (ID 3040)\n- Electric network (ID 3562) connecting to production facilities\n\n### Iron Production Lines\nMultiple setups with similar pattern:\n1. First line (around x=-28.0, y=-61.0):\n   - Burner mining drill\n   - Wooden chest at x=-27.5 y=-59.5\n   - Burner inserter at x=-26.5 y=-59.5\n   - Stone furnace at x=-25.0 y=-59.0\n   - Output inserter at x=-23.5 y=-58.5\n   - Storage chest at x=-22.5 y=-58.5\n\n2. Second line (around x=-18.0, y=-53.0):\n   - Similar setup with burner mining drill, chest, inserter, furnace chain\n   - Final storage chest at x=-12.5 y=-50.5 containing iron plates\n\n### Coal Mining Setup (around x=41.0, y=-82.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at x=41.0 y=-82.0\n- Storage chest at x=41.5 y=-80.5 (contains coal)\n- Burner inserter at x=41.5 y=-79.5\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Collision Errors\n- Check for existing entities before placing new ones - common collisions with:\n  - Wooden chests\n  - Transport belts\n  - Small electric poles\n  - Stone furnaces\n- When placing entities next to each other, adjust spacing or direction if initial placement fails\n- Consider using different directions (UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT) when standard placement fails\n\n### Resource Management\n- Ensure burner devices have fuel (multiple drills showing \"out of fuel\" warnings)\n- Monitor input resources for assemblers (copper plate shortage detected)\n\n### Production Line Setup\n- Verify complete input/output chains are properly connected before starting production\n- Ensure proper spacing between production line components to allow for inserter movements\n- Consider the full space requirements of larger entities (like assembling machines) when planning layouts"}
