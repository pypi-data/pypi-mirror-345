{"content": "Ah, now I understand the real error - it's not about the coal anymore, it's about entity placement! The error message says we can't place the burner inserter because there's already a stone furnace at that position. Let's modify the spacing and position:\n\n```python\n# Check our inventory\ninventory = inspect_inventory()\nprint(f\"Current inventory: {inventory}\")\n\n# First get some coal\ncoal_pos = nearest(Resource.Coal)\nmove_to(coal_pos)\nharvest_resource(coal_pos, quantity=20)\nprint(\"Harvested coal\")\n\n# Now let's fuel the unfueled mining drill\nmove_to(Position(x=-15.0, y=23.0))\ndrill = get_entity(Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill, Position(x=-15.0, y=23.0))\nif drill:\n    insert_item(Prototype.Coal, drill, quantity=5)\n    print(f\"Added fuel to mining drill at {drill.position}\")\n\n# Craft a stone furnace\ncraft_item(Prototype.StoneFurnace)\nprint(\"Crafted stone furnace\")\n\n# Now let's place the furnace and set it up\nmove_to(Position(x=-10.0, y=29.0))\n\n# Place the furnace\nfurnace = place_entity(\n    Prototype.StoneFurnace,\n    position=Position(x=-10.0, y=29.0),\n    direction=Direction.UP\n)\n\nif furnace:\n    print(f\"Placed new furnace at {furnace.position}\")\n    # Add fuel to the furnace\n    insert_item(Prototype.Coal, furnace, quantity=5)\n    print(\"Added fuel to furnace\")\n\n    # Add input inserter with increased spacing\n    input_inserter = place_entity_next_to(\n        Prototype.BurnerInserter,\n        reference_position=furnace.position,\n        direction=Direction.LEFT,\n        spacing=2  # Increased spacing to avoid collision\n    )\n    \n    if input_inserter:\n        print(f\"Added input inserter at {input_inserter.position}\")\n        insert_item(Prototype.Coal, input_inserter, quantity=5)\n        print(\"Added fuel to input inserter\")\n\n# Verify our setup\nprint(f\"Final inventory: {inspect_inventory()}\")\nentities = get_entities()\nprint(f\"Current entities: {entities}\")\n```\n\nKey changes made:\n1. Increased the spacing parameter from 1 to 2 in place_entity_next_to\n2. This should prevent the collision between the furnace and inserter\n\nThe error was occurring because the inserter was trying to be placed too close to the existing furnace. By increasing the spacing, we should give enough room for both entities to exist without overlapping.", "summary_range": "[1-864]"}
