{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (4.0, -60.0) with a drop position at (4.5, -58.5)\n- Wooden Chests at positions (5.5, -60.5), (4.5, -58.5), (7.5, -60.5), (6.5, -60.5), (9.5, -60.5), and (8.5, -60.5) for storage and transfer of materials\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates\n- Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates\n- Stone Furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors when using function arguments incorrectly\n- Ensure that the second argument for the `insert_item` function is an Entity or EntityGroup, not a Position. This prevents assertion errors when inserting items into entities.\n\n### Errors due to lack of fuel\n- Regularly check and refuel burner mining drills to avoid them running out of fuel, which stops production.\n\n### Errors due to full storage\n- Regularly empty chests at drop positions to prevent blockage in the mining process.\n\n### Errors due to lack of ingredients\n- Ensure furnaces have a continuous supply of ingredients to avoid them idling due to no ingredients to smelt.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - `insert_item(item: Prototype, target: Entity or EntityGroup, quantity: int)`: Inserts a specified quantity of an item into a target entity or entity group. Ensure the target is correctly specified as an Entity or EntityGroup.\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `furnace_position: Position` - Used to specify the position of furnaces for item insertion.\n  - `coal_to_insert: int` - Represents the quantity of coal intended for insertion into entities."}
