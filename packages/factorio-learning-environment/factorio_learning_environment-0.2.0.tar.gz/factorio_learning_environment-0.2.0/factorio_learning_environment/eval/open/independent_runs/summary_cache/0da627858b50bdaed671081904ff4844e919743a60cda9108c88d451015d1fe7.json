{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production at (-73.5, 2.5)\nConsists of two furnaces working in parallel:\n- Stone furnace at position (3.0, -73.0) - Currently active with 3 iron ore and 33 coal units, containing 11 iron plates\n- Stone furnace at position (5.0, -73.0) - Has 21 coal units and 1 iron plate in output, currently idle due to lack of ore\n\n### Copper Plate Production at (-69.0, 4.0)\nConsists of two furnaces working in parallel:\n- Stone furnace at position (3.0, -69.0)\n- Stone furnace at position (5.0, -69.0)\nBoth furnaces have coal as fuel (23 units each) but currently have no copper ore to process. Their output inventories are empty.\n\n### Research Lab at (0.5, -79.5)\nSingle lab structure loaded with 10 automation science packs and set to research Automation technology. Currently not operational due to lack of power.\n\n### Power Generation System\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position (-43.5, -125.5) - Operational and producing water\n- Boiler at position (-33.5, -115.0) - Operational with 8 coal units, producing steam at 165\u00b0C\n- PipeGroup connecting offshore pump to boiler, running through positions (-42.5,-124.5) to (-35.5,-115.5)\nSystem is fully operational with water flowing and steam being generated.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when trying to place steam engine\n- Before placing a steam engine, ensure there is sufficient clear space around the target location\n- Check for any existing entities or obstacles in the planned placement area\n- Steam engines require a specific orientation and connection to the boiler's steam output, plan the layout accordingly\n\n### Errors when trying to craft items without sufficient materials\n- Before attempting to craft complex items (like steam engine), ensure you have all required ingredients\n- Calculate total material requirements before starting crafting chains\n\n### Errors when trying to place entities without required items in inventory\n- Before attempting to place structures like furnaces, labs, or pumps, ensure you have the required items in your inventory\n- If placement fails, check recipe requirements and craft necessary items first\n\n### Errors when trying to insert items that are not in inventory\n- Before attempting to insert items (like coal) into entities, verify that you have the required items in your inventory\n- If you need to insert fuel, make sure to harvest or craft the necessary fuel items first\n\n### Errors related to furnace operation\n- Monitor furnace input inventories to ensure continuous operation\n- Most furnaces are idle due to lack of ore input, consider restocking ore supplies when furnaces run empty\n\n### Power-related errors\n- Research labs require power to function\n- Ensure power generation infrastructure is fully operational by adding fuel to boiler"}
