{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Wooden Chest at position(-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of:\n- Chest containing iron ore (417 units remaining)\n\n### Stone Furnace at position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Furnace currently processing iron ore (49 units remaining)\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position(-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill refueled with coal (11 units remaining) and currently operational\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when extracting from the chest\n- The chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) is full, which prevents further extraction. Regularly check and empty the chest to maintain continuous mining operations.\n\n### Errors when inserting into the furnace\n- Ensure that the furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) has space available for new items before attempting to insert. \n\n### Errors when using entities that are full\n- Monitor the inventory of connected entities (like chests) to avoid interruptions in processing or extraction due to full inventories.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the current execution steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `iron-ore`: int (total amount of iron ore in the chest)\n- `coal`: int (amount of coal available for refueling)\n- `position`: tuple (coordinates of various entities on the map)"}
