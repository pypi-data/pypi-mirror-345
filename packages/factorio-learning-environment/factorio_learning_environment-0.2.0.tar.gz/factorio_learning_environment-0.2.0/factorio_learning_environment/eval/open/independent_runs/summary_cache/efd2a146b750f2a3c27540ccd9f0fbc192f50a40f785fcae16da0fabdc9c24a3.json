{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Operation at (15.5, 70.5)\n- Electric mining drill at (15.5, 70.5) extracting iron ore\n- Still disconnected from power network (status: NO_POWER)\n\n### Power Generation Plant at (-9.5, -0.5)\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, -0.5) working\n- Boiler at (-5.5, 0.0) out of fuel (status: NO_FUEL)\n- Steam engine at (-0.5, 0.5) not connected\n- Partial pipe network:\n  - Pipe at (-8.5, -0.5)\n  - Pipe at (-7.5, -0.5)\n- Current issues:\n  - Broken pipe connection between (-7.5, -0.5) and boiler\n  - Boiler fuel depletion\n\n### New Smelting Setup at (25.0, 79.0)\n- Electric mining drill at (25.5, 75.5)\n- Stone furnace at (25.0, 79.0)\n- Input burner inserter at (25.5, 77.5)\n- Output wooden chest at (27.5, 79.5)\n- Output burner inserter at (26.5, 79.5)\n- Still non-functional due to power issues\n\n### Secondary Smelting Setup at (20.0, 73.0)\n- Electric mining drill at (20.5, 70.5)\n- Stone furnace at (20.0, 73.0)\n- Output wooden chest at (22.5, 73.5)\n- Still missing input inserter configuration\n\n### New Mining Operation at (20.5, 20.5)\n- Electric mining drill at (20.5, 20.5)\n- Still unconnected to any processing chain\n\n### New Furnace Setup at (20.0, 20.0)\n- Stone furnace at (20.0, 20.0) with 19 coal\n- Wooden chest at (21.5, 20.5)\n- Still idle due to missing input materials\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Persistent Water Placement Issues\n- Multiple failed offshore pump placements (steps 40,42,45)\n- Critical solution:\n  - Verify water depth before placement (needs deep water)\n  - Check minimum distance from shore (1 tile buffer)\n  - Use debug tools to validate water positions\n\n### Fluid System Connection Failures\n- Continuing pipe connection problems (steps 44,46,47)\n- Required checks:\n  - Clear 1-tile path between connection points\n  - Verify pipe alignment matches connection points\n  - Check for existing obstructions in pipe path\n\n### Resource Location Assumptions\n- Failed iron ore checks at (30,30) (step 43)\n- Always:\n  - Scan area before assuming resource presence\n  - Store valid resource locations\n  - Implement resource discovery routines\n\n### Power Plant Repair Issues\n- Multiple repair attempts failing (steps 44,46,47)\n- Critical steps:\n  1. Fix pipe connection between (-7.5,-0.5) and boiler\n  2. Add fuel to boiler\n  3. Connect steam engine to boiler output\n\n### Entity Collision Problems\n- Continuing placement failures (steps 41,42,44,47)\n- Always:\n  - Scan target area before placement\n  - Maintain minimum clearance buffers\n  - Implement pre-placement validation\n\n### Production Chain Verification\n- All production chains still non-functional\n- Verify:\n  1. Complete power connections\n  2. Fuel in all burner devices\n  3. Correct inserter alignment\n  4. Material flow paths\n\n### Boiler Fuel Issues\n- Boiler still out of fuel\n- Implement:\n  - Regular fuel checks\n  - Automated fuel delivery\n  - Fuel reserve buffers\n\n### Entity Spacing Problems\n- Continuing placement failures\n- Critical spacing:\n  - Minimum 0.5 tile clearance\n  - Larger machines need 1+ tile buffers\n  - Plan layouts with adequate spacing"}
