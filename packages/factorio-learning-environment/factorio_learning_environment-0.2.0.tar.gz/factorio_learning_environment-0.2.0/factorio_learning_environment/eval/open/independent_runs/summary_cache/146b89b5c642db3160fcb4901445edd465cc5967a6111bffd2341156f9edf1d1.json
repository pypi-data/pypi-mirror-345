Check if the chest at the drop position is full and empty it if necessary.\n\n### Errors when supplying iron ore to furnaces\n- Verify that there is iron ore in your inventory before attempting to supply it to furnaces. Maintain a sufficient stock of iron ore to avoid insertion failures.\n\n### Errors when transferring items to non-existent entities\n- Double-check the positions of entities before transferring items to them. Ensure that the target entity exists at the specified position to avoid errors.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing. Check the tile is free of other entities to avoid placement errors."}
