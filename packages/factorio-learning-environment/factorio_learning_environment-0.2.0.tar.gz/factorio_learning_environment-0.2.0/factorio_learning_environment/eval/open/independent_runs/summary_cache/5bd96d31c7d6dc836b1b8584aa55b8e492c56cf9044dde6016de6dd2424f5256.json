{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-46.5, -121.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (-41.5, -117.5)\n- Small Electric Pole at Position (-39.5, -116.5)\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-19.0, -73.0) with copper-plate output\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0) with iron-plate output\n- Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0) with no output\n\n### Storage and Transfer System\nConsists of:\n- Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5)\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) connected to the small electric pole at Position (5.5, -60.5) and the wooden chest at Position (7.5, -61.5)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (6.5, -59.5) containing iron plates\n\n### Research Facility\nConsists of:\n- Lab with automation-science-pack input and no power\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- PipeGroup at Position (-1.5, 11.5)\n- PipeGroup at Position (-0.5, 17.5)\n- PipeGroup at Position (-12.5, 23.5)\n- PipeGroup at Position (-4.5, 24.5)\n- PipeGroup at Position (1.5, 24.5)\n- PipeGroup at Position (2.5, 25.5)\n\n### Electricity Network\n- Electricity Group with poles spanning from Position (18.5, 11.5) to Position (7.5, -55.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Using Pipes\n- Ensure that pipes are correctly placed at the intended positions before attempting to use them. Verify the presence of pipes at positions (-47.5, -122.5) and (-46.5, -122.5) to avoid \"No pipe found\" errors.\n\n### Boiler Connection Errors\n- Connect the boiler to a water source to avoid the \"Boiler is still not connected to the water source\" error. Ensure that the offshore pump and boiler are properly aligned and connected.\n\n### Inserter Power Issues\n- Ensure that inserters are connected to a powered electric pole to prevent \"not receiving electricity\" warnings. Check the connections of inserters to the power network.\n\n### Lab Power Issues\n- Connect the lab to a power source to avoid \"no power\" status. Ensure that the lab is within the range of an active electricity network."}
