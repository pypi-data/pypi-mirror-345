{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -76.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-15.5, -77.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -73.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n- Stone Furnace at position (9.0, -64.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n- Stone Furnace at position (6.0, -62.0) with an Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) which is not receiving electricity\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Multiple Small Electric Poles connected across various positions, forming an electricity network with id 846846, but currently not providing power\n\n### Incomplete Electricity Generator\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-46.5, -123.5) connected to a Pipe Group at position (-46.5, -122.5)\n- Steam Engine at position (-40.5, -113.5) not connected to the power network and lacking fluid input\n\n### Storage Facilities\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (7.5, -61.5) containing iron plates\n- Wooden Chest at position (6.5, -59.5) containing iron ore, iron plates, and copper plates\n\n### Research Lab\n- Lab with input for automation science packs but not receiving power\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing and connecting entities\n- Ensure there is a suitable position available for placing entities like boilers. Check the area manually if automated placement fails.\n- Verify that pipes are correctly aligned and unobstructed when attempting to connect different entities, such as offshore pumps to boilers or boilers to steam engines.\n\n### Errors due to missing attributes in code\n- When accessing attributes of objects, ensure that the object has the attribute you are trying to access. For example, 'PipeGroup' object does not have a 'prototype' attribute.\n\n### Errors when refueling\n- Ensure that there is a nearby entity capable of accepting fuel, such as coal, before attempting to refuel.\n\n### Errors due to lack of power\n- Ensure that all entities requiring power are connected to a functioning power network. Check connections and ensure the power source is operational."}
