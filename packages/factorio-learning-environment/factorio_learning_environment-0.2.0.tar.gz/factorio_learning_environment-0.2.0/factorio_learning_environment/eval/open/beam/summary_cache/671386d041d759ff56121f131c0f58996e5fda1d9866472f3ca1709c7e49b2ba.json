{"content": "I now understand the core issue - we don't have a stone furnace in our inventory to place! Let's check what we actually have in our inventory first and work from there.\n\n```python\n# First let's check what we have to work with\nprint(f\"Current inventory: {inspect_inventory()}\")\n\n# Move to the drill position\nmove_to(Position(19.0, -17.0))\nprint(\"Moved to drill position\")\n\n# Get our drill reference\ndrill = get_entities({Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill})[0]\ndrop_pos = drill.drop_position\nprint(f\"Working with drill at {drill.position}, drops at {drop_pos}\")\n\n# First make sure drill has fuel\ninsert_item(Prototype.Coal, drill, quantity=5)\nprint(\"Added fuel to drill\")\n\n# Wait for drill to mine some iron ore\nprint(\"Waiting for drill to mine iron ore...\")\nsleep(10)\n\n# Check what we've mined\nprint(f\"Current inventory after mining: {inspect_inventory()}\")\n\n# If we have a stone furnace recipe, craft it\ntry:\n    craft_item(Prototype.StoneFurnace, quantity=1)\n    print(\"Crafted stone furnace\")\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"Could not craft stone furnace: {e}\")\n\nprint(f\"Final inventory status: {inspect_inventory()}\")\n```\n\nThis should help us understand:\n1. What items we start with\n2. Whether we can mine iron ore\n3. Whether we can craft a stone furnace\n4. What our options are for proceeding\n\nWould you like me to try this approach?", "summary_range": "[1-3418]"}
