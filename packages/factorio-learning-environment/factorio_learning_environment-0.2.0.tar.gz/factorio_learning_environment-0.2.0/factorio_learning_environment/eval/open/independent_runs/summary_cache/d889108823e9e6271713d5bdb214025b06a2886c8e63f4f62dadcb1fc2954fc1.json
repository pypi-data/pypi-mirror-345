{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-7.25, -1.0)\nConsists of offshore pump (position(-9.5, -0.5)), boiler (position(-7.5, -1.0)), and steam engine (position(-4.5, -0.5)). The offshore pump is connected to the boiler via a pipe (position(-9.5, -1.5)). The boiler is connected to the steam engine.\n\n### Stone mine at position(-46.0, 0.0)\nConsists of burner mining drill (position(-46.0, 0.0)), burner inserter (position(-44.5, 0.5)), and wooden chests (positions(-44.5, -0.5) and (-45.5, 1.5)). The burner inserter is used to transfer mined stone from the drill to the chests.\n\n### Coal mine at position(16.0, 0.0)\nConsists of burner mining drill (position(16.0, 0.0)), burner inserter not present but implied, and a wooden chest (position(15.5, -1.5)). \n\n### Copper ore mine at position(-46.0, 71.0)\nConsists of burner mining drill (position(-46.0, 71.0)), burner inserter (position(-44.5, 71.5)), and wooden chests (positions(-45.5, 72.5)). The burner inserter is used to transfer mined copper ore from the drill to the chests.\n\n### Iron ore mine at position(16.0, 71.0)\nConsists of burner mining drill (position(16.0, 71.0)), burner inserter (position(17.5, 71.5)), and wooden chests (positions(17.5, 70.5) and (16.5, 72.5)). The burner inserter is used to transfer mined iron ore from the drill to the chests.\n\n### Furnace group at positions(-45.0, 3.0), (-41.0, 3.0), (-45.0, 74.0), (-41.0, 74.0), (17.0, 74.0), and (21.0, 74.0)\nConsists of multiple stone furnaces used for smelting ores into plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n- Ensure that the chests used for storing mined resources are not full to avoid halting the mining process.\n- Make sure that furnaces have the necessary fuel (coal) and ingredients to smelt.\n- The steam engine is not connected to a power network; ensure it is connected to an electric pole.\n- The boiler is out of fuel; ensure a steady supply of coal or other fuel.\n- Inserters should be fueled and have a clear path to transfer items.\n\n## NAMESPACE\nNo utility functions have been defined by the agent in the given logs."}
