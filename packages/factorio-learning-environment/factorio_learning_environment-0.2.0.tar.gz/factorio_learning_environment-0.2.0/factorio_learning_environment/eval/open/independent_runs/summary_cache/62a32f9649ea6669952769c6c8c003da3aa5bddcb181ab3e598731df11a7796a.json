The agent made repeated attempts to establish a Lab at Position(0.5, 2.5) \u2013 intended to supply Automation Science Packs for research \u2013 but placement and crafting operations failed due to API misuse and insufficient resources. Although the agent interacted with smelting furnaces (an iron furnace at Position(5.0, 5.0) and a copper furnace at Position(\u201327.0, \u201360.0)) to process ores, these appear to be pre\u2010existing facilities rather than newly built structures.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 API Usage for Entity Retrieval  \n  \u2013 When calling get_entities, ensure the arguments match the defined signature. Avoid using unsupported keyword arguments (such as \u201cradius\u201d) and do not supply unexpected positional parameters.\n\n\u2022 Lab Placement  \n  \u2013 Verify that a Lab item is present in the inventory before attempting to place one at a target location to prevent placement failures.\n\n\u2022 Iteration over Entity Collections  \n  \u2013 Confirm that objects expected to be iterables (for example, the result from get_entities) are not None before attempting to iterate over them.\n\n\u2022 Lab Crafting and Resource Dependencies  \n  \u2013 Before initiating lab crafting, check that all required sub-ingredients (such as iron-plate, iron-gear-wheel, copper-plate, copper-cable, and electronic-circuit) are available and that the necessary crafting or smelting machinery is operational. This helps avoid errors related to missing ingredients and ensures that dependency chains are fully satisfied."}
