Make sure the connection points are valid and that the pipes can connect without any issues.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it. Check for any existing entities in the target position that may block placement.\n\n### Errors related to power connections\n- Verify that all power connections are established correctly and that entities requiring power are connected to a power source."}
