{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=22.5, y=-7.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=22.5, y=-7.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=20.5, y=-4.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=19.5, y=-1.5)\n- Connected pipes forming a network from positions (x=19.5, y=-12.5) to (x=25.5, y=-5.5)\n- Small Electric Pole at position (x=24.5, y=-7.5)\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=2.0, y=0.0) for copper plate smelting\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=5.0, y=5.0) for additional copper plate smelting\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) for iron plate smelting\n\n### Water Supply System\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=4.5, y=-10.5)\n- Pipe network from position (x=5.5, y=-8.5) to (x=8.5, y=-7.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors When Placing Entities\n- Ensure the target location is clear before placing an entity. The agent attempted to place a lab at positions (12.5, -4.5) and (12.5, -5.5) where something was in the way. Verify the target tile is unoccupied before placement.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Fuel or Ingredients\n- Ensure that boilers and furnaces have the necessary fuel and ingredients. The boiler at position (x=20.5, y=-4.0) is out of fuel, and the furnaces lack ingredients to smelt. Regularly check fuel and ingredient levels to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Errors in Electrical and Fluid Connections\n- Verify that all electrical and fluid connections are properly established. The steam engine is not receiving electricity or input liquid due to missing connections. Ensure that all pipes and electric poles are correctly connected to the respective entities."}
