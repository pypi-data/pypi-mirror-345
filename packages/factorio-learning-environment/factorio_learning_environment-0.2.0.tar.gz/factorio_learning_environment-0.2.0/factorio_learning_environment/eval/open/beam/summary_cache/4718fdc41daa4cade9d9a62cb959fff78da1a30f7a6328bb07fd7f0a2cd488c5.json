{"content": "## Report\n\n### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Plate Smelting Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (3.0, 0.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (6.0, 0.0)\n\nEach furnace is fueled with coal and used for smelting iron ore into iron plates. The furnaces are currently operational and have been used to successfully produce iron plates.\n\n#### Coal Extraction Site\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (40.5, -83.5)\n\nThe burner mining drill is fueled with coal and is operational, extracting coal and depositing it into the wooden chest.\n\n#### Iron Ore Extraction Site\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (-15.5, -51.5)\n\nThe burner mining drill is fueled with coal and is operational, extracting iron ore and depositing it into the wooden chest.\n\n#### Copper Ore Extraction Site\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-28.0, -61.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (-28.5, -62.5)\n\nThe burner mining drill is fueled with coal and is operational, extracting copper ore and depositing it into the wooden chest.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when extracting items from furnaces\n- Ensure that the furnace contains the items you intend to extract. Attempting to extract items that are not present will result in an error.\n\n#### Errors due to undefined variables\n- Verify that all variables used in loops or functions are properly defined before use. This will prevent `NameError` exceptions.\n\n#### Errors when inserting items into furnaces\n- Check your inventory to ensure you have the items available before attempting to insert them into a furnace. Attempting to insert items not present in your inventory will result in an error.\n\n#### Errors in crafting due to missing ingredients\n- Ensure that all required ingredients for crafting are available in your inventory. If a crafting recipe requires items that cannot be crafted (e.g., raw resources), make sure to gather them first.\n\n#### Errors in crafting due to missing sub-ingredients\n- Verify that all sub-ingredients required for crafting a complex item are available. If a sub-ingredient cannot be crafted, ensure that you have gathered the necessary raw resources or crafted the required intermediate items.\n\n#### Errors when placing entities without having them in inventory\n- Ensure that you have the entity in your inventory before attempting to place it on the map. Attempting to place an entity not present in your inventory will result in an error.\n\n#### Errors when extracting from non-existent entities\n- Ensure that the target entity exists and contains the items you intend to extract. Attempting to extract from an invalid or empty entity will result in an error."}
