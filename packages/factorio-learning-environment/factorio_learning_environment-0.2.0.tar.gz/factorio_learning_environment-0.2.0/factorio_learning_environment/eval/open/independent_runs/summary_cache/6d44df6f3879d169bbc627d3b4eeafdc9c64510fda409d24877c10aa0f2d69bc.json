{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0), responsible for mining iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserters**:\n  - At position (-13.5, -48.5), transferring items from the mining drill to the furnace.\n  - At position (-14.5, -47.5), transferring items between chests.\n  - At position (-8.5, -47.5), transferring items from the furnace to a storage chest.\n  - At position (-11.5, -45.5), waiting for source items.\n- **Stone Furnaces**:\n  - Furnace 1 at position (-12.0, -48.0), smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n  - Furnace 2 at position (-10.0, -48.0), also smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Chests**:\n  - Wooden chest at position (-14.5, -48.5), used for intermediate storage.\n  - Wooden chest at position (-15.5, -48.5), used for intermediate storage.\n  - Wooden chest at position (-6.5, -48.5), storing iron plates.\n  - Wooden chest at position (-14.5, -46.5), used for intermediate storage.\n  - Wooden chest at position (-7.5, -47.5), used for intermediate storage.\n  - Wooden chest at position (-6.5, -47.5), storing iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### UnboundLocalError: Cannot access local variable 'x'\n- Ensure that all local variables are properly defined and initialized before use.\n\n### Inventory Full Errors\n- Regularly check and clear inventories to avoid overfilling and ensure continuous operation.\n\n### Missing Entity Definition\n- Ensure all entities are properly defined and initialized in the code to avoid runtime errors.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entities for inserters are supplying the necessary items to prevent idle inserters."}
