{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity group at position (x=52.5, y=49.0) and (x=52.5, y=54.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Electricity group (position x=52.5, y=49.0) and electricity group (position x=52.5, y=54.0)\n\n### Offshore pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore pump (position x=-9.5, y=24.5)\n- Pipe (position x=-9.5, y=23.5) and pipe (position x=-9.5, y=22.5)\n\n### Furnace at position (x=1.0, y=1.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position x=1.0, y=1.0)\n\n### Chest at position (x=3.5, y=1.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest (position x=3.5, y=1.5)\n\n### Lab at position (x=6.5, y=1.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab (position x=6.5, y=1.5)\n\n### Burner inserter at position (x=8.5, y=1.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner inserter (position x=8.5, y=1.5)\n\n### Additional Furnace at position (x=10.0, y=1.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position x=10.0, y=1.0)\n\n### Additional Chests\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest (position x=3.5, y=3.5)\n- Wooden chest (position x=3.5, y=5.5)\n\n### PIPE GROUP\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Pipe group (fluid system=63165, fluid=water, position=x=4.5, y=5.5)\n\n### ELECTRICITY GROUP\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Electricity group (id=155531, poles=[(x=2.5,y=1.5),(x=5.5,y=-0.5),(x=9.5,y=-0.5),...,(x=46.5,y=51.5),(x=50.5,y=51.5),(x=50.5,y=50.5)])\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n### Errors when placing electric poles\n- Ensure that the target location for placing electric poles is clear of any blocking entities or terrain that is unplaceable (e.g., water).\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities\n- Verify that the entity you are trying to retrieve exists at the specified position. If the entity type is not found, check the position for accuracy and ensure that the entity has been placed correctly.\n\n### Repeated Errors\n- The errors related to placing electric poles at positions (x=52.5, y=49.0) and (x=52.5, y=54.0) have occurred multiple times. Ensure to check for consistent blocking entities before attempting to place again.\n- The error regarding the retrieval of the steam engine at position (x=10.0, y=0.0) has been logged multiple times. Confirm the existence of the steam engine at that position before attempting retrieval."}
