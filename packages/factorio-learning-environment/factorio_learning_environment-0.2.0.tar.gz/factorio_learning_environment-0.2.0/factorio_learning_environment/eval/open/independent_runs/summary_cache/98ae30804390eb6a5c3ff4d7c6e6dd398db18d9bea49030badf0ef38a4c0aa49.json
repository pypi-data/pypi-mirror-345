{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=1.5, y=23.0)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\n- Boiler at Position (x=1.5, y=23.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\n- Pipe Group connecting various positions including (x=3.5, y=17.5) and (x=-9.5, y=23.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting pipes\n- Ensure that the pipes are correctly aligned and positioned to connect entities. Verify that there are no obstructions or misalignments in the pipe network between the boiler at (x=1.5, y=23.0) and the steam engine at (x=17.5, y=20.5).\n\n### Errors due to no input liquid or fluid presence\n- Check that the offshore pump is correctly supplying water to the boiler and that the fluid system is intact and operational. Ensure that all pipes are correctly connected and that there are no leaks or breaks in the fluid system.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `connect_entities(boiler, steam_engine, {Prototype.Pipe, Prototype.UndergroundPipe})`: Attempted to connect boiler to steam engine using pipes, but failed due to misalignment or incorrect connections.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `pipes`: List of pipe entities intended to connect the boiler and steam engine.\n- `inventory`: Current inventory includes items such as 'pipe', 'pipe-to-ground', 'boiler', 'burner-mining-drill', 'offshore-pump', 'stone-furnace', among others."}
