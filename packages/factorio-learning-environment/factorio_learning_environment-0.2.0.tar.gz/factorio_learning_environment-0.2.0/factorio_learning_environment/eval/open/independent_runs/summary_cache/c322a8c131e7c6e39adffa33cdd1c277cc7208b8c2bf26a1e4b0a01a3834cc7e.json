{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-46.5, -123.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-46.5, -123.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-44.5, -124.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (-40.5, -113.5)\n- Pipe Group connecting the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine with positions: \n  - (-46.5, -122.5), (-44.5, -122.5), (-45.5, -122.5), (-42.5, -123.5), (-42.5, -122.5), (-43.5, -122.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-15.0, -76.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at Position (-15.5, -77.5)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-19.0, -73.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n- Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0) with iron plates being produced\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) connected to a small electric pole and a wooden chest\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n\n### Storage and Logistics\n- Wooden Chest at Position (-15.5, -77.5) containing iron ore\n- Wooden Chest at Position (6.5, -59.5) containing iron ore, iron plates, and copper plates\n- Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5) containing iron plates\n\n### Power Distribution Network\n- Small Electric Poles distributed across multiple positions to restore power to inserter and lab\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using undefined functions\n- Ensure that all functions used in the code are defined before calling them. For instance, the error \"Failed to shift boiler: name 'shift_entity' is not defined\" indicates the function `shift_entity` was not defined.\n\n### Errors when crafting items without required sub-ingredients\n- Before crafting an item, ensure all sub-ingredients are available or can be crafted. The error \"Failed to craft 5x small-electric-pole because couldn't craft a required sub-ingredient for small-electric-pole - copper-cable - couldn't craft a required sub-ingredient for copper-cable - copper-plate\" suggests that the necessary copper plates were not available or not produced in a furnace.\n\n### Errors related to power supply\n- Ensure that all entities requiring power are connected to a working power network. The inserter and lab were not receiving electricity, indicating a possible disconnection or insufficient power supply.\n\n### Errors when attempting to smelt without ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt before attempting to use them. The warning \"no ingredients to smelt\" indicates that the furnace is inactive due to the lack of input materials."}
