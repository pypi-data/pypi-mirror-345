{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with status NO_INGREDIENTS\n- Furnace at position (x=10.0, y=0.0) with status NO_INGREDIENTS\n- Furnace at position (x=13.0, y=0.0) with status NO_INGREDIENTS\n- Furnace at position (x=16.0, y=0.0) with status NO_INGREDIENTS\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=8.5, y=0.5) connected to the furnace at position (x=10.0, y=0.0)\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=17.5, y=0.5) connected to the furnace at position (x=16.0, y=0.0)\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=19.5, y=0.5) connected to another burner inserter at position (x=20.5, y=0.5)\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=20.5, y=0.5) connected to another burner inserter at position (x=19.5, y=0.5)\n\n### Electricity Generator\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5) with status NOT_CONNECTED\n- Boiler at position (x=-1.5, y=24.0) with status NOT_CONNECTED\n- Steam Engine at position (x=5.5, y=21.5) with status NOT_CONNECTED\n\n### Lab Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab at position with input of automation-science-pack: 7, status NO_POWER\n\n### Pipe Network\nConsists of the following pipe groups:\n- PipeGroup at position (x=-0.5, y=11.5) with status EMPTY\n- PipeGroup at position (x=-0.5, y=22.5) with status EMPTY\n- PipeGroup at position (x=-6.5, y=25.5) with status EMPTY\n- PipeGroup at position (x=3.5, y=24.5) with status EMPTY\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of the following entities:\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at positions [(x=1.5, y=14.5), (x=3.5, y=20.5), (x=1.5, y=10.5), (x=1.5, y=2.5), (x=1.5, y=6.5)], voltage 0\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing pipes\n- Ensure the target position for placing pipes is not already occupied by another entity. Remove any existing entities at the target position before attempting to place a new pipe.\n\n### Errors with entity references in code\n- Ensure correct reference to entities in the code. For example, use 'entities.Lab' instead of 'Lab' to avoid NameError.\n\n### Errors when connecting pipes\n- Verify that all necessary connections between entities, such as boilers and steam engines, are correctly established. Ensure there are no missing connections or incorrect configurations.\n\n### Errors with inventory management\n- Check the inventory before attempting to insert items into entities to ensure the required items are available.\n\n### Errors with power connections\n- Make sure all power-generating entities are correctly connected to the power network to avoid issues with entities not receiving power.\n\n### Connection failures between offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine\n- Ensure that there are no obstructions blocking the path of pipes and underground pipes. Clear any potential obstructions and verify that the connections are correctly aligned and placed."}
