If a burner-inserter (or similar object) already occupies the desired location, adjust spacing or change placement direction to avoid conflicts.\n\n\u2022 Connection Path Normalization:\n\u2003- Establish grid-aligned, segmented pathways when connecting belt segments. Repeated \u201cNot a valid path to normalise\u201d errors indicate that the chosen corridor or connection points are not properly aligned or are obstructed.\n\n\u2022 Buildability Verification:\n\u2003- Always check that candidate positions for transport and underground belts are buildable. Confirm that tiles are free and meet placement requirements before proceeding with manual or detour route attempts.\n\n\u2022 API and Argument Integrity:\n\u2003- Access position attributes properly without invoking them as functions. When picking up entities, strictly follow the function signature (e.g., if the first argument is an Entity, the second should be None) to avoid type errors.\n\n\u2022 Distance Constraint Compliance:\n\u2003- Ensure that any repositioned entities, such as a target inserter, are within the permissible placement distance. If an error indicates that a target position is too far (e.g., distance of 12.75 exceeds the maximum of 10), move closer before attempting placement.\n\n\u2022 Inventory and Dependency Verification:\n\u2003- Prior to placing entities, confirm that the necessary items are available in the inventory and that all production dependencies are met.\n\n\u2022 Consistent Corridor Reassessment:\n\u2003- In cases of recurring connection failures, re-evaluate corridor selection and intermediate connection points, expanding the search area or clearing obstructions as needed to achieve a continuous network.\n"}
