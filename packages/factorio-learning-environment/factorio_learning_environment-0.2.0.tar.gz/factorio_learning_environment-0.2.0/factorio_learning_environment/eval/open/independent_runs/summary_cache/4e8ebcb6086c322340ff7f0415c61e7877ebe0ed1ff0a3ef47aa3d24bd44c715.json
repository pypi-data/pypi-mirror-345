Persistent NO_FUEL warnings (e.g. in the boiler and select burner inserters) require proactive refueling to maintain continuous operation.\n\u2003\n\u2022 Power Connection and Electrical Stability\n\u2003\u2013 Verify that every power-dependent module is properly connected. Continuous NO_POWER and NOT_CONNECTED statuses (notably in the assembling machine and steam engine) indicate the need for a thorough reconnection check.\n\u2003\n\u2022 Input Resource Provisioning\n\u2003\u2013 Coordinate and synchronize resource delivery to production units. Furnaces experiencing NO_INGREDIENTS errors suggest that input buffers are not being adequately replenished.\n\u2003\n\u2022 Placement and Occupancy Verification\n\u2003\u2013 Check target tiles for occupancy before placing new transport belts or network segments. Historical placement failures due to existing entities necessitate pre-validation of placement areas.\n\u2003\n\u2022 Timing and Synchronization Overheads\n\u2003\u2013 Introduce adequate wait intervals between auto reconfiguration and maintenance routines to allow systems to stabilize. This minimizes data discrepancies and misalignments in network connections.\n\u2003\n\u2022 Persistent Core Module Connection Issues\n\u2003\u2013 Reassess critical facilities\u2014including the smelting furnace at (x=-3.0, y=19.0), the assembling machine at (x=1.5, y=19.5), the boiler at (x=-5.5, y=24.0), and the steam engine at (x=-0.5, y=24.5)\u2014to ensure they receive proper inputs, fuel, and power connections. Monitor auto-remediation cycles closely and intervene manually where corrective measures remain active."}
