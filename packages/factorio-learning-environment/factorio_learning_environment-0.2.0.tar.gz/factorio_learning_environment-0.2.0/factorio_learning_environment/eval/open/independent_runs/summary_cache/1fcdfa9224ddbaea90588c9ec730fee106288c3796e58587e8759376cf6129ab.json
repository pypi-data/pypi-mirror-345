{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (4.0, -60.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (4.0, -60.0) with 12 units of coal as fuel. The furnace is operational with iron ore being smelted.\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility at Position (5.0, -60.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (5.0, -60.0) with 6 units of coal as fuel. The furnace is currently not smelting due to lack of ingredients.\n\n### Coal Mining Operation at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) out of fuel. The drill's drop position is at (40.5, -83.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (40.5, -83.5) collecting coal from the drill.\n\n### New Coal Mining Operation at Position (42.0, -84.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (42.0, -84.0) out of fuel. The drill's drop position is at (41.5, -85.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -85.5) collecting coal from the new drill.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Operation at Position (-15.5, -50.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Electric Mining Drill at position (-15.5, -50.5) not operational due to lack of power. The drop position is at (-15.5, -52.5).\n\n### Boiler and Offshore Pump Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Boiler at position (-5.5, 21.0) not operational due to lack of fuel and no input liquid.\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5) not connected to any fluid system.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors When Placing Entities on Occupied Tiles\n- Ensure that the target tile is free before placing an entity. Attempts to place a boiler at (-8.0, 24.0) failed because the target position was already occupied by water.\n\n### Errors Due to Missing Inventory Items\n- Ensure that all required items are available in the inventory before attempting to place entities. Multiple attempts to connect pipes failed due to the absence of pipes in the inventory.\n\n### Errors When Extracting Items from Non-Existent or Empty Entities\n- Verify the presence and contents of entities before attempting to extract items. Multiple attempts to extract items from furnaces failed because the furnaces did not contain the specified items.\n\n### Errors When Crafting Without Required Resources\n- Gather all necessary resources before crafting items. An attempt to craft a steam engine failed due to the absence of sufficient iron plates.\n\n### Errors When Placing Entities Adjacent to Non-Existent References\n- Ensure that the reference entity exists and is correctly specified when placing entities next to other entities. An attempt to place a wooden chest next to a burner mining drill failed due to an incorrect reference to the drill's drop position.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Fuel\n- Regularly check and replenish fuel for entities like burner mining drills to ensure continuous operation. The burner mining drills are currently out of fuel and not operational.\n\n### Errors When Placing Entities Without Required Inventory\n- Ensure that the required entities are available in the inventory before attempting placement. The placement of a wooden chest failed due to the absence of the chest in the inventory.\n\n### Errors When Crafting Items with Sub-Ingredient Issues\n- Ensure that all sub-ingredients are available and can be crafted or gathered before attempting to craft complex items. An attempt to craft iron gear wheels failed because the required iron plates could not be crafted without a crafting machine or smelting in a furnace.\n\n### Errors When Placing Entities with Incorrect References\n- Verify the reference position and ensure it is valid and accessible. An attempt to place a wooden chest next to a newly placed burner mining drill failed due to an incorrect reference to the drill's drop position.\n\n### Errors When Using Non-Initialized Variables\n- Ensure that all variables are initialized and have valid references before use. An attempt to move to a new burner mining drill's position failed because the drill was not properly initialized.\n\n### Errors When Inserting Items Without Available Resources\n- Check inventory for the availability of items before attempting to insert them into entities. An attempt to insert coal into a new burner mining drill failed due to the absence of coal in the inventory.\n\n### Errors Due to Output Blockage\n- Ensure that the output destination for mining drills is not blocked. The new burner mining drill at position (42.0, -84.0) is waiting for space in the destination as the output is full. Place a sink object at (41.5, -85.5) to unblock.\n\n### Errors When Inserting Incompatible Items\n- Ensure"}
