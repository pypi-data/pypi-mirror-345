# gallery-dvk

*gallery-dvk* is a command-line program designed to download media from various media sharing websites: [See Supported Sites](./docs/supportedsites.md)

It is heavily inspired by [gallery-dl](https://github.com/mikf/gallery-dl), and if I were smart, I probably would have just forked gallery-dl, but I couldn't fully wrap my head around how the codebase works, so here we are. I may not be able to parse the code very well, but I've ripped off gallery-dl's user documentation pretty thoroughly here.
