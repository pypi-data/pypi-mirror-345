{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron ore mining and smelting structure at position around (17.5, 72.5)\nConsists of the following connected entities:\n- Electric mining drill at position (17.5, 72.5) facing down, powered but output blocked due to furnace belt blockage.\n- Stone furnace at position (18.0, 75.0) fueled with coal, working but with full input inventory of iron ore and limited output.\n- Three wooden chests at positions (19.5, 75.5), (21.5, 75.5), and (21.5, 77.5), serving as storage for iron plates; the chest at (21.5, 77.5) is currently empty.\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5) and (20.5, 77.5) fueled and operational, moving iron plates into chests.\n- Small electric poles at (15.5, 75.5), (17.5, 72.5), (22.5, 75.5), and (12.5, 72.5) connected to power network.\n- Output belt blockage at furnace output persists, limiting throughput.\n\nThis structure enables iron ore extraction, smelting, and storage with improved power connectivity and inserter fueling, but output congestion remains a bottleneck.\n\n### Steam power generation structure at position around (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, -0.5) extracting water.\n- Boiler at position (-5.0, 2.5) fueled with coal and working.\n- Steam engine at position (0.5, 6.5) connected to boiler by pipes, generating power.\n- Small electric poles near boiler (-4.5, -0.5), steam engine (0.5, 3.5), and newly placed pole at (0.5, 6.5).\n- Coal inserted into boiler regularly to maintain operation.\n\nThis structure reliably generates electricity from steam power, supplying the factory\u2019s electric network.\n\n### Iron gear wheel assembly structure at position around (25.5, 80.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine 2 at (25.5, 80.5), powered and operational but still lacking iron plate input for crafting.\n- Input wooden chest at (21.5, 75.5) feeding iron plates into assembly area.\n- Output wooden chest at (25.5, 82.5), currently empty.\n- Burner inserter at (25.5, 83.5) fueled and operational, moving assembled items into output chest.\n- Iron plates have been inserted directly into the assembling machine, resulting in some iron gear wheels produced but output chest remains empty.\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 77.5) and (25.5, 83.5) fueled and operational.\n\nThis structure is set up for iron gear wheel production with power and inserters in place; recent direct insertion of iron plates enabled limited crafting, though output chest remains unstocked.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity placement conflicts due to occupied tiles\n- Failed attempts to place small electric poles near furnace at (18.0, 75.0) and steam engine at (0.5, 6.5) due to tile occupancy by existing entities such as mining drills and poles.\n- To avoid these errors, always check tile occupancy before placement and consider increasing spacing, changing placement direction, or selecting alternate nearby reference positions.\n\n### Inserter inventory and fuel management\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5), (20.5, 77.5), and (25.5, 83.5) consistently fueled and operational.\n- Some inserters show waiting for source items status due to empty source chests (e.g., chest at 21.5, 77.5 is empty).\n- Maintain steady supply of input materials in source chests to prevent inserters from idling.\n\n### Crafting and recipe dependency errors\n- Assembling machine 2 at (25.5, 80.5) previously unable to craft due to missing iron plates.\n- Recent direct insertion of iron plates into assembling machine allowed production of iron gear wheels, but output chest remains empty.\n- Ensure continuous supply of iron plates to input chest or directly to assembling machine.\n- Monitor output chest to confirm items are being transferred correctly; troubleshoot inserters if output chest remains empty.\n\n### Output blockage and power connectivity warnings\n- Mining drill at (17.5, 72.5) still reports furnace belt output blockage, limiting iron ore extraction.\n- Furnace input inventory often full, indicating output congestion downstream.\n- Power network improved with additional poles placed at (17.5, 72.5), (22.5, 75.5), and (12.5, 72.5).\n- To"}
