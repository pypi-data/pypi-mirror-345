avoid forcing placements that result in distance errors.\n  \u2022 Ensure all pipeline components are properly defined to prevent variable reference issues (e.g. avoid undefined references such as \"new_intermediate_pipe\").\n\n- Direct Connection and Connector Placement:\n  \u2022 Confirm tile availability using placement checks (e.g. can_place_entity must return true) before positioning connector pipes.\n  \u2022 Refrain from attempting connector placements at restricted positions (such as (0.0, 21.5)) where constraints prevent successful placement.\n  \u2022 Monitor inventory levels to ensure sufficient pipes are available when executing multi-step connection chains.\n\n- Burner Inserter and Fuel Chest Placement:\n  \u2022 When placing burner inserters adjacent to fuel chests, maintain adequate spacing and validate that target tiles are unoccupied to avoid collisions with nearby structures like pipes or boilers.\n\n- Fuel Supply Management and Entity Consistency:\n  \u2022 Regularly monitor fuel levels and maintain consistent entity references during placement and connection operations to reduce inadvertent errors."}
