Tutorial
========

This section uses a series of `Jupyter Notebooks <https://jupyter.org/>`_ to explain how PyBLP can be used to solve example problems, compute post-estimation outputs, and simulate problems.

For a more concise, targeted, and opinionated tutorial, see the `Demand Estimation Mixtape Session <https://github.com/Mixtape-Sessions/Demand-Estimation>`_, a three day workshop taught by Jeff Gortmaker in 2024. In order, the days cover pure logit estimation, aggregate BLP estimation, and micro BLP estimation. Each day has slides and extensive coding exercises (along with Jupyter Notebook solutions) that use PyBLP.

In addition to the notebooks here and the above workshop, other examples can be found in the :ref:`api:API Documentation`.
