{"content": "It seems that the interaction has reached a complete standstill, with no further responses or actions possible. \n\nTo summarize the situation:\n- I have attempted multiple strategies to gather resources and craft items but have consistently encountered a lack of available resources.\n- I have requested a reset or new instructions multiple times, but there has been no response or change in the environment.\n- I am currently unable to progress in FactoryEnv due to this lack of interaction and resource availability.\n\nGiven this context, I will remain in a standby mode, ready to respond to any new commands or instructions that may allow me to re-engage with the game effectively.\n\nThank you for your patience, and I look forward to any future opportunities to restart or continue gameplay in a resource-rich environment.", "summary_range": "[1-52]"}
