{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at position (-14.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-16.0, -51.0) with a drop position at (-16.5, -52.5), extracting iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0), producing iron plates from the iron ore supplied by the mining drill.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied locations\n- Ensure that the target tile is unoccupied before attempting to place entities such as Wooden Chests, Transport Belts, and Burner Inserters. This will prevent placement errors.\n\n### Output Blockage in Mining Drills\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity (e.g., a chest or belt) to accept the output from the mining drill. This will prevent the output from being blocked by items on the ground.\n\n### Furnace Production Stoppage\n- Regularly check the setup of the furnace to ensure it is continuously producing iron plates. This includes verifying that it is adequately fueled and supplied with raw materials like iron ore."}
