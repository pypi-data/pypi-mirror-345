{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at Position (-28.0, -62.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (x=-28.0, y=-62.0) fueled with coal, currently working and producing copper plates.\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-28.0, y=-61.0) fueled with coal, currently working with a drop position at (x=-28.5, y=-62.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-31.5, y=-61.5) for storage.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-26.5, y=-60.5) for storage.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-26.5, y=-61.5) waiting for source items, with a pickup position at (x=-27.5, y=-61.5) and drop position at (x=-25.5, y=-61.5).\n- BeltGroup connecting various positions for material transport, including:\n  - Belt from (x=-28.5, y=-61.5) to (x=-28.5, y=-63.5) in the upward direction.\n  - Belt from (x=-26.5, y=-59.5) to (x=-28.5, y=-59.5) in the leftward direction.\n  - Belt from (x=-30.5, y=-61.5) to (x=-30.5, y=-59.5) in the downward direction.\n  - Belt from (x=-28.5, y=-63.5) to (x=-26.5, y=-63.5) in the rightward direction.\n  - Belt from (x=-27.5, y=-62.5) to (x=-27.5, y=-60.5) in the downward direction.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) fueled with coal, currently working and producing iron plates.\n- Furnace at position (x=3.0, y=0.0) fueled with coal, currently working and producing iron plates.\n- Furnace at position (x=6.0, y=0.0) fueled with coal, currently working and producing iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=1.5, y=1.5) for storage.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=0.5, y=1.5) waiting for source items, with a pickup position at (x=-0.5, y=1.5) and drop position at (x=1.5, y=1.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items without having them in inventory\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. This will prevent errors like \"No iron-ore to insert from your inventory\" or \"No coal to insert from your inventory.\"\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Before placing an entity, verify that the target tile is unoccupied. This will help avoid errors such as \"Could not place wooden-chest at (-28.5, -62.5), as there is an existing object in the way.\"\n\n### Errors with connecting entities without required items\n- Make sure you have the necessary items in your inventory to connect entities, such as transport belts. This will prevent errors like \"Could not connect transport-belt from x=-28.0 y=-61.0 to x=-28.5 y=-62.5. You do not have the required item in their inventory.\"\n\n### Errors due to undefined variables\n- Ensure all variables are defined before use. Errors like \"NameError: name 'belt_group_1_position' is not defined\" can be avoided by checking variable declarations.\n\n### Errors due to incorrect function arguments\n- Verify that the function arguments match the expected parameters. Errors like \"TypeError: __call__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'prototype'\" can be prevented by reviewing the function's signature and ensuring correct usage."}
