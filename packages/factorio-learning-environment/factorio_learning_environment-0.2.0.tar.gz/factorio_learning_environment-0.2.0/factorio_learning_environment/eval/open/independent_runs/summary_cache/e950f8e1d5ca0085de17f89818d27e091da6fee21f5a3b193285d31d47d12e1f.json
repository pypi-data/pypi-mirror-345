{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n###Coal Mining and Transport System at (-83.5, 39.5)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill outputting at (39.5, -83.5)\n- Wooden chest at (39.5, -83.5) collecting coal from drill\n- Transport belt at (39.5, -84.5)\n- Burner inserter with pickup at (40.5, -84.5) and drop at (40.5, -82.5)\n\nThe system is designed to mine coal, store it in a chest buffer, and transport it via inserter to a belt system.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Conflicts\n- Check for existing entities before placing new ones at a location\n- Ensure target placement locations are clear of items and other entities\n\n### Entity Output Blocking Issues\n- When setting up mining systems, ensure there is always a valid output destination (chest, belt, or inserter) to prevent \"output blocked\" warnings\n- Monitor chest fullness to prevent mining stoppage due to full output chests\n\n### Fuel Management\n- Keep mining drills fueled to prevent work interruption\n- Implement automated refueling systems when possible\n- Monitor fuel levels regularly to prevent \"NO_FUEL\" status\n\n### Inventory Management\n- Verify required items are in inventory before attempting to place entities\n- Craft required items (like wooden chests) before attempting placement\n\n### Inserter Configuration\n- Ensure inserter pickup and drop positions are correctly aligned with source and destination entities\n- Verify inserter rotation is appropriate for the intended material flow direction\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nFunctions:\n- place_entity(): Places game entities at specified coordinates\n  Success: When placement location is clear and item is in inventory\n  Failure: When location is blocked or item is missing from inventory\n\nImportant Variables:\n- EntityStatus (enum): WORKING, WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION, WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS, NO_FUEL, EMPTY\n- inventory (dict): Tracks player's current items and quantities\n- belt_group_status (EntityStatus): Tracks status of belt systems\n- drill_warnings (list): Contains active warning messages for mining drills"}
