{"content": "## Report\n\n### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Ore Extraction and Processing at Position (-15.5, -51.5)\n- **Entities:**\n  - Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0)\n  - Wooden Chest at position (-15.5, -51.5)\n  - Burner Inserter at position (-14.5, -51.5)\n- **Use-case:** This setup is intended to extract iron ore using the mining drill, store it in the chest, and then transfer it using the inserter.\n\n#### Iron Ore Processing and Smelting at Position (62.0, -53.0)\n- **Entities:**\n  - Stone Furnace at position (62.0, -53.0)\n  - Burner Inserter at position (63.5, -52.5)\n  - Burner Inserter at position (61.5, -54.5)\n- **Use-case:** This setup is designed to smelt iron ore into iron plates. The inserters are used to input iron ore into the furnace and manage the output.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that inserters have a consistent supply of items to transfer. Regularly check that the source containers have the necessary items.\n\n#### Errors in Connecting Belts\n- Belts cannot be directly connected to chests or furnaces. Use inserters to transfer items between belts and these entities.\n\n#### Errors in Placing Entities\n- Before placing an entity, ensure the target tile is unoccupied. Remove any existing entities if necessary before placing a new one.\n\n#### Errors with Crafting Items\n- Ensure that all required ingredients are available in the inventory before attempting to craft an item. For example, crafting transport belts requires iron plates, which need to be smelted in a furnace.\n\n#### Errors with Distance Limitations\n- Move closer to the target position when placing entities. The maximum placement distance is 10 tiles.\n\n#### Errors due to Lack of Inventory Items\n- Ensure that the necessary items are available in the inventory before attempting to place or craft entities. For example, attempting to place a wooden chest requires having it in the inventory."}
