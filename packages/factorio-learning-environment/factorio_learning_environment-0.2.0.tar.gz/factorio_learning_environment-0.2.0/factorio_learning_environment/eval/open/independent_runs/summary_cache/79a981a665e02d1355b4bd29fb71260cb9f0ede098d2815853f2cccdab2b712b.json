{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=-2.5, y=25.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Boiler at position (x=-2.5, y=25.0) with coal fuel, producing steam.\n- Steam Engine at position (x=1.5, y=27.5), currently not connected to a fluid source.\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-7.5, y=25.5), supplying water to the system.\n\n### Pipe Network\n- PipeGroup (fluid_system=14571) at position (x=-6.5, y=24.5), status: Working, carrying water.\n- PipeGroup (fluid_system=14574) at position (x=-0.5, y=27.5), status: Empty.\n- PipeGroup (fluid_system=14573) at position (x=0.5, y=30.5), status: Empty.\n\n### Electricity Network\n- ElectricityGroup (id=79411) with multiple poles, providing electrical connections across the map.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Connecting Steam Engine\n- Ensure that the steam engine is properly connected to the boiler with pipes that allow steam to flow. Currently, the steam engine at position (x=1.5, y=27.5) is not connected to a steam source, resulting in a lack of power generation.\n\n### Errors in Inventory Management\n- Before attempting to insert fuel, verify that there is sufficient coal in the inventory. The failure to insert coal occurred due to an empty inventory.\n\n### Errors in Pipe Placement\n- When connecting pipes, ensure that the pipe network is complete and allows fluid to flow from the source to the destination. Repeated clearing and reconnecting of pipes without resolving the connection issue suggests a need to review the pipe layout."}
