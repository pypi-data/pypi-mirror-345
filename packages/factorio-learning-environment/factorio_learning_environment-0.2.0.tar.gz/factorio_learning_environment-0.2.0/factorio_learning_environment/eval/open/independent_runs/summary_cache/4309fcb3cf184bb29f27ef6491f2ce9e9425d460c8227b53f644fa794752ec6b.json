{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-18.5, 19.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position -18.5, 19.5), boiler (position -25.5, 20.0), and offshore pump (position -11.5, 26.5). The steam engine is currently not connected to the power network and has no input liquid.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(-18.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position -18.0, -49.0) and a furnace (position 5.0, -73.0)\n\n### Copper cable factory at position(-21.5, 25.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine (position -21.5, 25.5) and inserter that puts into the assembling machine\n- Beltgroup that connects the furnace at position -18.0, -49.0 to the assembling machine at position -21.5, 25.5\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting pipes\n- Ensure that there are no placement blockages when attempting to connect pipes between the boiler and offshore pump, as well as between the steam engine and boiler. Check for nearby entities that may obstruct the connection.\n\n### Errors when adding fuel to boiler\n- Ensure that the boiler is placed near a source of coal or that coal is available in the inventory to add fuel to the boiler.\n\n### Errors retrieving entities\n- Verify that the entities you are trying to access (like lab and assembling machine) are correctly placed on the map at the specified positions. If they are not found, check if they have been moved or removed.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it."}
