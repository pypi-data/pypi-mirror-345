{"content": "# Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity group\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Small electric pole at position (0.5, 1.5)\n- Small electric pole at position (2.5, 2.5)\n- Small electric pole at position (5.5, 4.5)\n- Small electric pole at position (1.5, 1.5)\n\n### Lab at position (6.5, 6.5)\nThe lab is used for conducting research. Currently, it has a status of \"no power\" and requires 10 automation science packs to complete the automation research.\n\n### Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace with fuel (coal: 18) and a status indicating \"no ingredients to smelt\".\n\n### Furnace at position (2.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace with fuel (coal: 7) and a status indicating \"no ingredients to smelt\".\n\n### Wooden chest at position (3.5, 0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Wooden chest with an empty inventory.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to electric poles not being plugged into the electric network\n- Ensure that electric poles are connected properly to power sources and that they are within the range of the entities they are intended to power.\n\n### Errors when using building box dimensions\n- Verify that the dimensions of the building box are correct and compatible with the entity being created. Check for any discrepancies in the expected width and height.\n\n### Errors when connecting poles to the lab\n- Confirm that the lab is within the power network and that all necessary connections are made before attempting to power it.\n\n### Errors related to insufficient ingredients for research\n- Ensure that the required ingredients (in this case, automation science packs) are available in sufficient quantities to complete the research tasks."}
