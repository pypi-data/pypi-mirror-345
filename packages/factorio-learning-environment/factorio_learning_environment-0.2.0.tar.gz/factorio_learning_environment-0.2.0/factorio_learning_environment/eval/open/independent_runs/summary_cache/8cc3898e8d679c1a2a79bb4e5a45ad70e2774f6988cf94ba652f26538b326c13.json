Adjust layouts to alleviate congestion near critical connections (such as around (2.5, 21.5)).\n\n\u2022 Offshore Pump and Electronic Component Crafting Failures  \n\u2003\u2013 Verify that all sub-ingredients (like copper cables and copper plates) are sufficiently available to support downstream crafting. Consolidate resource flows to prevent unmet ingredient errors.\n\n\u2022 Entity Placement and Collision Issues  \n\u2003\u2013 Multiple failures occurred when placing Small Electric Poles adjacent to the Copper Cable Assembling Machine at target positions (e.g., (5.5, 0.5), (6.5, 0.5), (3.5, -1.5), (3.5, 2.5), (3.5, 3.5)). Similarly, attempts to place a Stone Furnace near (2.5, 6.5) failed due to collision at (6, 6.5). Ensure target tiles are free and adjust spacing, direction, or reference positions accordingly before placement.\n\n\u2022 Component Extraction Failures  \n\u2003\u2013 Repeated failures to extract Copper Cable from the Assembling Machine (both at the original location (3.5, 0.5) and after repositioning to (2.5, 6.5)) indicate the need to confirm that production is complete and that a valid output entity is present prior to extraction.\n\n\u2022 Repositioning and Buildable Area Computation Errors  \n\u2003\u2013 Errors such as the TypeError stating that a 'Position' object is not callable highlight the importance of treating Position objects as data structures. Validate buildable area computations and avoid invoking such objects as functions.\n\n\u2022 Resource Insertion and Availability Issues  \n\u2003\u2013 Errors inserting Copper Plates into the new Assembling Machine (due to lack of inventory) underscore the necessity of monitoring resource levels closely and ensuring that required inputs are stocked before triggering production.\n\n\u2022 Fuel and Resource Insertion Issues  \n\u2003\u2013 Past errors (e.g., failure to insert coal into the Boiler) remind operators to proactively monitor and replenish critical resources to maintain continuous production.\n\n\u2022 Removal Operation and Relocation Computation Errors  \n\u2003\u2013 Ensure entities exist and that their data types are correctly handled when performing removals or positional computations to avoid TypeErrors related to NoneType or improper use of Position objects."}
