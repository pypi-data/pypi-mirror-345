{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\n- Pipe Group at Position (-47.5, -122.5)\n- Steam Engine at Position (-40.5, -113.5)\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -76.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-15.0, -76.0)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (-15.5, -77.5)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-19.0, -73.0)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (6.0, -62.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0)\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5)\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility at Position (9.0, -64.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0)\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of:\n- Electricity Group with poles at various positions including (x=4.5, y=-57.5), (x=4.5, y=-56.5), (x=8.5, y=-56.5), and more.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Power Connection\n- Ensure that there are no blockages when attempting to connect power poles. Verify that the path is clear between the intended connection points.\n- When reconnecting power, confirm that the target positions are correct and that the entities exist at those positions.\n\n### Errors with Fluid Connections\n- Verify that pipes are correctly connected to both the steam engine and the water source. Ensure all necessary connections are established without gaps.\n\n### Errors with Entity Placement\n- Before placing an entity, check that the target tile is not already occupied by another entity to avoid placement blockage.\n\n### Errors with Inserter and Lab Power\n- Ensure that inserters and labs are properly connected to the power network. Check for any missing connections or power poles that might prevent electricity from reaching these entities.\n\n### Errors with Resource Availability\n- Regularly check and clear full chests to prevent mining drills from halting operations due to full output."}
