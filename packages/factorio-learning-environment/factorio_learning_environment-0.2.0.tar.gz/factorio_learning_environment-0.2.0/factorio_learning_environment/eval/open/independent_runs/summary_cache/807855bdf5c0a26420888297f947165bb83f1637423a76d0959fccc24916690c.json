{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) extracting coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (41.5, -83.5) transferring coal from the mining drill to a wooden chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (40.5, -83.5) storing coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (42.5, -83.5) storing coal with an inventory of 263 units.\n- Burner Inserter at position (41.5, -80.5) transferring coal to another wooden chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -79.5) storing coal with an inventory of 185 units.\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (42.5, -83.5) to (44.5, -83.5) and (43.5, -83.5) to (45.5, -83.5) for coal transportation.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with no ingredients to smelt, containing 50 iron plates.\n- Stone Furnace at position (2.0, 0.0) with no ingredients to smelt, containing 63 iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entity for the inserter has items available for transfer. Check the supply chain to ensure raw materials are being delivered to the inserter's source.\n\n### No Ingredients to Smelt in Furnace\n- Verify that the furnaces are supplied with the necessary raw materials for smelting. Ensure that the supply chain is delivering ores to the furnaces.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
