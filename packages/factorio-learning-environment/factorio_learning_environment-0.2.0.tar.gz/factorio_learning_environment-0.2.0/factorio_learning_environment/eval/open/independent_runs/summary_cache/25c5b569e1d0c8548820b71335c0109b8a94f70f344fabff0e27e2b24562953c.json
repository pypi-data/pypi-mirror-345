{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=4.0, y=-60.0) with a drop position at (x=4.5, y=-58.5). This drill is currently operational and mining iron ore, but it is experiencing a bottleneck due to a full chest at the drop position.\n- **Wooden Chests** for storage, located at various positions around the mining drill and furnaces:\n  - Position (x=5.5, y=-60.5)\n  - Position (x=4.5, y=-58.5) containing iron ore\n  - Additional chests at positions (x=7.5, y=-60.5), (x=6.5, y=-60.5), (x=9.5, y=-60.5), (x=8.5, y=-60.5)\n- **Iron Chests** for storage:\n  - Position (x=-5.5, y=-50.5) containing iron ore and iron plates\n- **Stone Furnaces** for smelting iron ore into iron plates:\n  - Furnace at position (x=-15.0, y=-48.0)\n  - Furnace at position (x=-13.0, y=-48.0)\n  - Furnace at position (x=-11.0, y=-48.0)\n  - All furnaces are currently idle due to a lack of ingredients to smelt.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Full Chest Warnings\n- Ensure that chests used for storing mined resources are regularly emptied to prevent bottlenecks in resource extraction. The chest at position (x=4.5, y=-58.5) is full, which is halting the mining operation.\n\n### No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Maintain a steady supply of raw materials to furnaces to keep them operational. The furnaces at positions (x=-15.0, y=-48.0), (x=-13.0, y=-48.0), and (x=-11.0, y=-48.0) are currently idle due to a lack of iron ore.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- No utility functions or type-annotated variables have been defined or invoked in the provided steps."}
