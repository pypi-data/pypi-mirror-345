{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-11.5, 25.0)\nConsists of boiler (position -11.5, 25.0), steam engine (position -11.5, 18.5), and offshore pump (position -9.5, 24.5).\n- The boiler is currently full and is connected to the offshore pump for water supply.\n- The steam engine is not connected to the power network.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 0, 0) and a furnace (position 0, 0).\n\n### Copper plate factory at position(5, 5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 5, 5) and a furnace (position 5, 5).\n- Assembling machine (position z1) and inserter (position a) that puts into the assembling machine.\n- Beltgroup connecting the furnace at position 5, 5 to the assembling machine at position z1.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting entities\n- Ensure that the offshore pump is placed correctly to connect to the boiler. Check for any obstacles or incorrect positioning that may prevent the connection.\n- Verify that the boiler is properly positioned to connect to the steam engine. Placement issues can arise if the entities are too far apart or obstructed.\n\n### Errors related to power supply\n- The lab is not receiving power. Make sure that all power connections are properly established and that there are no breaks in the power network.\n- Check the status of the electricity generator and ensure it is connected to the power network to avoid power supply issues.\n\n### General placement errors\n- Ensure you can place an entity on a tile before attempting to place it. Check for occupied tiles or incorrect positioning that may lead to placement failures."}
