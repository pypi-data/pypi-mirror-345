{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nLocated at positions around x=-15.0, y=-50.0, this facility consists of:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0): Extracts iron ore and deposits it into the adjacent chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5): Stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates, but currently not receiving iron ore due to setup issues.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Insufficient Fuel\n- Ensure to maintain a sufficient supply of coal in the inventory to refuel mining drills and inserters. Regularly check fuel levels and replenish as needed.\n\n### Errors in Crafting Non-Existent Items\n- Avoid attempting to craft raw resources like coal. These must be gathered directly from the environment.\n\n### Inserter Setup Issues\n- Verify the alignment and positioning of inserters to ensure they can effectively transfer items between entities. Regularly check and adjust inserter positions if the target entity is not receiving the intended items.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Ingredients\n- Ensure the inserter is correctly aligned and operational to transfer iron ore from the chest to the furnace. Check for any obstructions or misalignments that may prevent the transfer of materials."}
