{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-16.0, y=-49.0) with a fuel inventory of coal and iron-ore being supplied. The furnace is currently full with iron plates.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0) with a fuel inventory of coal and iron-ore being supplied. The furnace is operational but not producing any output currently.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-47.5) supplying iron ore to the furnace at (x=-14.0, y=-49.0).\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-13.5, y=-46.5) storing items from the inserter.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-14.5, y=-45.5) moving items from the chest to another location.\n- Iron Chest at position (x=-11.5, y=-44.5) presumably storing iron plates.\n- Multiple transport belts connecting the furnaces, chests, and inserters, facilitating the movement of items between these entities.\n\n### Transport Belt Network\nConsists of the following entities:\n- A series of belts connecting various parts of the facility, ensuring the movement of materials between furnaces, chests, and inserters.\n- Belt at position (x=-16.5, y=-47.5) outputting towards (x=-16.5, y=-46.5).\n- Belt at position (x=-14.5, y=-46.5) outputting towards (x=-14.5, y=-47.5).\n- Belt at position (x=-12.5, y=-46.5) outputting towards (x=-11.5, y=-46.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items without sufficient inventory\n- Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. This will prevent errors such as \"Could not insert: No iron-ore to insert from your inventory\".\n\n### Errors with inserters waiting for source items\n- Check that the source entity has items available for the inserter to pick up. If the inserter is waiting for source items, ensure the source is being supplied adequately.\n\n### Errors with full output in furnaces\n- Regularly check and clear the output of furnaces to prevent them from becoming full. This will ensure continuous production and prevent warnings such as \"furnace result is full\"."}
