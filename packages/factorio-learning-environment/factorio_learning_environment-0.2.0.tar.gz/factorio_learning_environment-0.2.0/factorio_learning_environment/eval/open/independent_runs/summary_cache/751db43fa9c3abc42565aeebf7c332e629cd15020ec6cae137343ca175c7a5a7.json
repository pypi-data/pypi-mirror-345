{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-15.5, -51.5) for storing extracted iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-14.5, -51.5) transferring items from the mining drill to the wooden chest.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (62.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (62.0, -53.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserters at positions (60.5, -52.5) and (63.5, -52.5) for feeding coal into the stone furnace.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Incorrect Argument Types in API Calls\n- Ensure that when using functions like `insert_item`, the second argument must be an Entity or EntityGroup, not a Position. Correct the argument type to avoid assertion errors.\n\n### Errors with Extracting Items from Non-Existent Sources\n- Before attempting to extract items, verify that the target entity contains the required items. This will prevent exceptions related to non-existent sources.\n\n### Errors Due to Insufficient Inventory Items\n- Check your inventory to ensure you have the necessary items before attempting to insert them into entities. This will prevent errors related to insufficient items in the inventory.\n\n### Errors with Output Blockage in Inserters\n- Ensure that there is a valid destination entity for inserters to transfer items. If an inserter's output is blocked, it will not function properly. Make sure there is space in the destination entity to accept items."}
