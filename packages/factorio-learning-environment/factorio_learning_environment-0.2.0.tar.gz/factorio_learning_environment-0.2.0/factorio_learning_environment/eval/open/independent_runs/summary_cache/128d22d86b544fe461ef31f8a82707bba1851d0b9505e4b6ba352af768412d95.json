{"content": "# Factorio Game Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nNo structures have been successfully created on the map in the initial steps. The agent attempted to place wooden chests at various positions, but none of these placements were successful due to obstructions or other errors.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placement. Check for nearby obstructions and ensure the tile is clear.\n\n### Errors due to incorrect function usage\n- Ensure that all functions and methods are used correctly. For example, avoid calling non-callable objects like 'Position' as functions.\n\n### Errors due to type mismatch\n- Ensure that all data types are correctly matched and used. For instance, verify that the types used in expressions are compatible with the expected types in the code.\n\n### Errors due to lack of resources\n- Ensure that there are sufficient resources available to supply to structures like furnaces. Regularly check inventory levels and replenish resources as needed."}
