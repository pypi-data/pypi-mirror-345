{"content": "# Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Chest at position (-14.5, -52.5)\nConsists of a chest at position (-14.5, -52.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when extracting/inserting items\n- The agent is encountering a \"cannot access local variable 'x' where it is not associated with a value\" error when trying to extract/insert items into the chest. This indicates a problem with how the chest's position or other relevant data is being handled within the extraction/insertion logic. Ensure that the chest's coordinates are correctly passed and accessible within the function responsible for item transfer.\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- The agent is unable to place a chest at (-13.5, -51.5) and a furnace at (-15.5, -53.5) and (-14.5, -52.5) because the placement conditions are not met. Before attempting to place an entity, ensure that the target tile is free of obstructions and that the entity can be placed at that location.\n\n### Errors when crafting\n- The agent is failing to craft \"automation-science-pack\" due to a missing \"copper-plate\" ingredient. The error message indicates that copper plate needs to be smelted in a furnace. The agent needs to ensure it has a furnace available and is smelting copper ore into copper plates before attempting to craft the science pack.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Variables:\n- Inventory contents: `{'transport-belt': 6, 'coal': 595, 'iron-ore': 1800, 'copper-ore': 1259, 'iron-plate': 453}` (dict)\n- Chest contents: `{'iron-plate': 37}` (dict)\n"}
