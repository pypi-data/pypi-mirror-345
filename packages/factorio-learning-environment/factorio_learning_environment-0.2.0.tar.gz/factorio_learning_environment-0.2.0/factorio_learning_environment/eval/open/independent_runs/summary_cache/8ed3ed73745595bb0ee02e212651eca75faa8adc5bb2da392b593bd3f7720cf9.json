{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll generate a comprehensive report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Transport System (around x=41-45, y=-79 to -83)\nComplex automated coal mining and transport setup consisting of:\n- Burner mining drill (x=41.0, y=-82.0) mining coal\n- Storage iron chest (x=41.5, y=-83.5) collecting mined coal\n- Wooden chest (x=41.5, y=-80.5) as intermediate storage\n- Transport belt system:\n  - Belt facing right (x=42.5, y=-80.5)\n  - Belt facing down (x=42.5, y=-79.5)\n- Multiple inserters:\n  - Chest inserter (x=42.5, y=-79.5) facing left\n  - Furnace inserter (x=43.5, y=-80.5) facing right\n- Stone furnace (x=45.0, y=-81.0) as end point\n\n### Additional Production Structures\n- Secondary stone furnace (x=47.0, y=-81.0)\n- Storage wooden chest (x=49.5, y=-80.5) containing iron plates\n- Belt group running from y=-68.5 to y=-77.5 at x=42.5\n\nERROR TIPS\n1. Entity Placement Conflicts\n- Always check if target location is clear before placing entities\n- Remove existing entities if they occupy needed space\n- Common error: \"Could not find a suitable position to place [entity] at the target location, as there is an existing object in the way\"\n\n2. Transport System Configuration\n- When fixing transport systems, remove conflicting entities before placing new ones\n- Ensure proper orientation of inserters and belts before placement\n- Verify pickup and drop positions align with intended transport flow\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nImportant Variables:\n- chest_inserter: BurnerInserter\n- belt_right: TransportBelt\n- furnace_inserter: BurnerInserter\n\nSystem States:\n- EntityStatus.WORKING: Indicates properly functioning entities\n- EntityStatus.WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS: Indicates inserters waiting for items to move\n- EntityStatus.NO_INGREDIENTS: Indicates furnaces lacking materials to process\n- EntityStatus.NORMAL: Indicates normal operation of storage entities"}
