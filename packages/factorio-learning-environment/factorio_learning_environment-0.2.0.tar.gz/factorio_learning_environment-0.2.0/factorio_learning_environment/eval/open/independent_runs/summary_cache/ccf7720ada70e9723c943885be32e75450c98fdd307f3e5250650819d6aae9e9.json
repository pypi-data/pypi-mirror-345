{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (22.5, -7.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (22.5, -7.5)\n- Boiler at position (20.5, -4.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (19.5, -1.5)\n- Pipe connections linking the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine\n- Small Electric Pole at position (22.5, -4.5) for electricity distribution\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) for smelting copper ore into copper plates\n- Stone Furnace at position (2.0, 0.0) for additional smelting capacity\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at Position (5.0, 5.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (5.0, 5.0) for smelting copper ore into copper plates\n\n### Lab for Research\n- Lab at unspecified position, currently researching electronics but not receiving power\n\n### Inserter and Storage System\nConsists of:\n- Inserter at position (-3.5, 1.5) for moving items\n- Wooden Chest at position (-3.5, 0.5) for storage\n- Small Electric Poles at positions (-2.5, 1.5), (-2.5, 0.5), (-2.5, 2.5), and (-3.5, 2.5) for electricity distribution\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- PipeGroup at position (19.5, -12.5) with fluid system 6545, currently empty\n- PipeGroup at position (21.5, -10.5) with fluid system 6548, currently empty\n- PipeGroup at position (5.5, -8.5) with fluid system 6546, full of water\n- PipeGroup at position (19.5, -2.5) with fluid system 6555, full of water\n\n### Electricity Network\n- ElectricityGroup with ID 8952, consisting of multiple poles across the map\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Picking Up Pipes\n- Ensure the pipe exists at the specified position before attempting to pick it up.\n\n### Errors when Placing Pipes\n- Verify that the target position is unoccupied before placing a pipe. Remove any existing entity at the target position to avoid placement errors.\n\n### Boiler Water Supply Issues\n- Ensure that the boiler is correctly connected to the water source. Check pipe connections and ensure water is flowing into the boiler.\n\n### Inserter Power Issues\n- Ensure inserters are connected to a power source. Check the electricity network for continuity and resolve any disconnections.\n\n### Lab Power Issues\n- Verify that the lab is connected to a power source. Ensure the electricity network is functioning and supplying power to the lab."}
