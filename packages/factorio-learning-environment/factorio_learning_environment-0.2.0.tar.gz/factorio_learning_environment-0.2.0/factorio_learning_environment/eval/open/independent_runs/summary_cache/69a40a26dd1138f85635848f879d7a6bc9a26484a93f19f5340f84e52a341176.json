Always add an intermediate inserter for input into the steam engine rather than connecting directly.\n  \n\u2022 Placement Range and Inventory Issues\n  \u2013 Ensure the player is within the maximum allowable distance to the target position before attempting to place an entity (e.g. wooden chest placement failure due to target being too far).\n  \u2013 Verify that the required item is present in the inventory (e.g. wooden chest missing) or craft it beforehand.\n  \n\u2022 Variable Naming Consistency\n  \u2013 Confirm that all variables (such as the target chest reference) are correctly defined to prevent NameError exceptions."}
