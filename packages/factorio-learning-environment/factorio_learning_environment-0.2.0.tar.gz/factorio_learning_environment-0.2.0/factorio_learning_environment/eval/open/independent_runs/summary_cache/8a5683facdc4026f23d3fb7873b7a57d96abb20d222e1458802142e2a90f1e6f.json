Check all connection points and ensure that there are no missing pipes or incorrect connections.\n\n### Errors Related to Boiler Fuel\n- Make sure to supply the boiler with the necessary fuel to operate. Check the inventory and ensure that the fuel is available and correctly inserted into the boiler.\n\n### Errors Related to Fluid Systems\n- Verify that all pipes are correctly connected and that there are no breaks in the pipe network. Ensure that the fluid system is complete and that all necessary connections are made.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - None defined in the current log steps.\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `fluid_system_18355`: Represents the fluid system associated with a series of pipes.\n  - `fluid_system_18366`: Represents another fluid system associated with a different series of pipes.\n  - `electricity_group_34365`: Represents the electricity network with a series of poles and a voltage of 0."}
