{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(1, 1)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace at position (1.0, 1.0) which is currently working and processing iron ore.\n\n### Lab at position(3.5, 3.5)\nConsists of:\n- Lab at position (3.5, 3.5) which is currently not powered and attempting to connect to the electric network.\n\n### Electric pole at position(2.5, 2.5)\nConsists of:\n- Small electric pole at position (2.5, 2.5) which is currently not plugged into the electric network.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(x)\nConsists of following entities\n-  Burner mining drill (position x1) and a furnace at position(y1)\n-  Burner mining drill (position x2) and a furnace at position(y2)\n-  Burner mining drill (position x3) and a furnace at position(y3)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting to the electric network\n- Ensure that electric poles are placed in locations where they can connect to the electric network. Check for any obstructions or ensure that the poles are within range of other powered entities.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing. Check for existing entities in the target location.\n\n### Errors related to entity status\n- Regularly check the status of entities after placement to ensure they are functioning as intended. If an entity is not powered, investigate the connections to the electric network.\n\n### AttributeErrors in code\n- Review the code to ensure that the correct attributes are being accessed. For example, check that the objects being referenced have the expected properties and methods."}
