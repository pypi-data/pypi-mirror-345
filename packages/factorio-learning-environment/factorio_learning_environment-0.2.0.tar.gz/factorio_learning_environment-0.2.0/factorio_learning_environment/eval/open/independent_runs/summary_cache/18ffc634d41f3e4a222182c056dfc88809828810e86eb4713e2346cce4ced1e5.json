This structure was employed to boost the overall iron-plate count through a controlled smelting process.\n\n### Copper Smelting Furnace at position (-27.0, -60.0)\nConsists of a furnace located at (-27.0, -60.0) that is used to convert copper ore into copper plates. This structure supports production by processing copper ore into a more usable form via smelting.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 API Usage Errors \u2013 When calling get_entities, avoid using unsupported keyword arguments (such as \u201cradius\u201d) or providing unexpected positional arguments. Always verify the function\u2019s signature to ensure correct parameter usage.\n  \n\u2022 Null Iterable Handling \u2013 Before iterating over the results (for example, when filtering labs), ensure that the returned value is not None. Use a fallback (such as an empty list) when necessary to prevent TypeError exceptions.\n  \n\u2022 Lab Crafting and Placement \u2013 Repeated failures in both crafting and placement of the Lab are tied to insufficient sub-ingredients (for instance, iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, and copper-cables). Confirm that all necessary resources and intermediate products are available and that the inventory contains the Lab before attempting placement.\n  \n\u2022 Resource Production Chain \u2013 Errors indicating that items like iron-plate or copper-plate \u201ccannot be crafted\u201d underline the need to verify that smelting and other production processes are properly set up. Ensure that furnaces are receiving the correct inputs and that the production chain for sub-ingredients is fully operational before initiating lab production."}
