Gather more iron ore to keep both furnaces operational.\n2. Once we have enough iron ore, we can insert it into both furnaces to maximize production.\n3. Consider crafting additional entities based on our iron plate production.\n\nLet's proceed to gather more iron ore from the nearest resource patch.
