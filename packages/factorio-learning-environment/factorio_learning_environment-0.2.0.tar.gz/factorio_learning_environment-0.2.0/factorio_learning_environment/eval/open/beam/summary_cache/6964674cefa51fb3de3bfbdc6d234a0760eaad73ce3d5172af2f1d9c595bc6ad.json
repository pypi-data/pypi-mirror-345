{"content": "\"\"\"\nThe new stone furnace has been successfully set up and is currently working. However, it appears that it only processed 4 iron ore instead of the 5 we intended to insert, resulting in a total of 7 iron plates produced.\n\n**Current Inventory:**\n- 1 stone furnace\n- 45 wood (remaining)\n- 0 iron ore (remaining)\n- 7 iron plates (produced)\n- 1 iron gear wheel\n\n**Entities on the Map:**\n1. The new stone furnace at (0.0, 0.0) is operational and has processed 4 iron ore.\n2. The existing furnace at (-1.0, 2.0) has wood but no ingredients to smelt.\n3. The last furnace at (1.0, 2.0) is out of fuel and has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Next Steps\nNow that we have 7 iron plates, we can proceed to craft the burner mining drill, which requires:\n- 3 iron plates\n- 1 iron gear wheel\n\nWe have enough resources to craft the burner mining drill now. Let's go ahead and do that.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Craft the burner mining drill using the available resources (7 iron plates and 1 iron gear wheel)\ncraft_item(Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill, quantity=1)  # Crafting one burner mining drill\nprint(f\"Inventory after crafting burner mining drill: {inspect_inventory()}\")  # Check inventory after crafting the drill", "summary_range": "[1-148]"}
