{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) with fuel inventory of coal, actively mining iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-14.5, -48.5) and (-15.5, -48.5) used for storing mined resources.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5) transferring mined iron ore to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (-12.0, -48.0) and (-10.0, -48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserters** at positions (-14.5, -47.5) and (-11.5, -46.5) for transferring smelted iron plates to storage.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -46.5) for storing iron plates and iron ore.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-6.5, -49.5), (-6.5, -48.5), (-7.5, -48.5), (-5.5, -48.5), (-4.5, -48.5), and (-3.5, -48.5) used for storing iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-8.5, -47.5) for transferring iron plates between chests.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-6.5, -47.5) recently used for overflow storage of iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when attempting to insert items without sufficient inventory\n- Ensure that the required items are available in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity.\n\n### Errors due to inserters waiting for source items\n- Verify that the source entity has the necessary items available for the inserter to pick up. Regularly check and refill resources if needed.\n\n### Errors due to inserters waiting for space in destination\n- Ensure that the destination storage entity has enough space to accommodate incoming items. Regularly transfer items from full chests to prevent overflow.\n\n### Errors due to furnaces running out of fuel\n- Regularly check and refuel furnaces to maintain continuous smelting operations.\n\n### Errors due to chest being full\n- Monitor storage chests and transfer items to additional storage when nearing capacity to avoid halting production processes."}
