{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\nConsists of:\n- **Steam Engine** at position (x=17.5, y=20.5), currently not connected due to no input liquid.\n- **Boiler** at position (x=1.5, y=23.0), out of fuel but recently refueled with 10 coal.\n- **Offshore Pump** at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5), working and supplying water.\n- **Pipe Network** connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine, with sections at positions such as (x=-9.5, y=23.5) and (x=3.5, y=17.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Lack of Inventory Resources\n- Ensure that you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities. For example, attempting to insert coal into the boiler failed due to no coal in the inventory.\n\n### Errors in Connecting Entities\n- Verify that all entities are correctly aligned and positioned to connect them successfully. The connection attempt between the boiler and steam engine failed, possibly due to misalignment or incorrect pipe placement.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- **insert_item**: Attempts to insert a specified quantity of an item into an entity. Failed when the item was not available in the inventory.\n- **connect_entities**: Connects entities using specified prototypes (e.g., pipes). Failed due to incorrect alignment or placement, resulting in a nil connection.\n\n### Important Variables\n- **boiler**: Represents the boiler entity, used in refueling and connection operations.\n- **steam_engine**: Represents the steam engine entity, used in connection operations.\n- **pipes**: Represents the pipe network used to connect the boiler and steam engine."}
