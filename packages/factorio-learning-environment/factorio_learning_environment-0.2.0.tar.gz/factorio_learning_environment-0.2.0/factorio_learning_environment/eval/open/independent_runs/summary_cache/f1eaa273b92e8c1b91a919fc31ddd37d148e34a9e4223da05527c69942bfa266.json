{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=20.5, y=-4.0)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (x=22.5, y=-7.5)\n- Boiler at Position (x=20.5, y=-4.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (x=19.5, y=-1.5)\n- Pipe Group connecting the offshore pump to the boiler at Position (x=19.5, y=-2.5), (x=18.5, y=-2.5), (x=18.5, y=-3.5)\n- Small Electric Pole at Position (x=22.5, y=-4.5)\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at Position (x=2.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill (not explicitly mentioned but inferred from the presence of a furnace)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=2.0, y=0.0)\n\n### Iron Plate Mine at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill (not explicitly mentioned but inferred from the presence of a furnace)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\n\n### Additional Structures\n- Offshore Pump at Position (x=4.5, y=-10.5) connected to a Pipe Group at Position (x=4.5, y=-9.5)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (x=-3.5, y=0.5)\n- Inserter at Position (x=-3.5, y=1.5) connected to the wooden chest\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=5.0, y=5.0)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Inventory Items\n- Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities. For example, ensure you have coal before trying to insert it into a boiler.\n\n### Errors in Connecting Entities\n- Verify the connection paths and ensure that all entities are correctly aligned and connected. For instance, ensure that pipes are properly connected between the offshore pump and the boiler to allow fluid flow.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Power\n- Ensure that all electrical entities are connected to a power source and that the power network is complete. Check that small electric poles are properly placed and connected to provide power to inserters and other electrical devices."}
