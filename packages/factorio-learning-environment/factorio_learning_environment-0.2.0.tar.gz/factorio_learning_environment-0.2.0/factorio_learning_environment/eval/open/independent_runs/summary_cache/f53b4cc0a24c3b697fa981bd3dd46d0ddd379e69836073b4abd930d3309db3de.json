{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Copper plate mine at position(41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of following entities\n-  Burner mining drill (position (41.0, -82.0)) and a furnace at position (41.0, -80.0)\n-  Burner inserter (position (39.5, -79.5)) that puts into furnace at position (41.0, -80.0)\n-  Belt group (position (40.5, -83.5)) that connects the burner mining drill at position (41.0, -82.0) to the furnace at position (41.0, -80.0)\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(60.0, -60.0)\nConsists of following entities\n-  Furnace (position (60.0, -60.0))\n\n### Electricity generator at position(117.5, -30.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position (117.5, -30.5)), boiler (position (111.5, -32.0)) and offshore pump (position (106.5, -32.5))\n-  Pipe group (fluid system 211373) that connects the offshore pump at position (106.5, -32.5) to the boiler at position (111.5, -32.0)\n-  Pipe group (fluid system 211368) that connects the boiler at position (111.5, -32.0) to the steam engine at position (117.5, -30.5)\n-  Electricity group (id 612550) that connects the steam engine at position (117.5, -30.5) to the small electric poles at positions (115.5, -30.5), (120.5, -26.5), (111.5, -27.5), (111.5, -30.5), (115.5, -32.5), (112.5, -24.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n### Errors when using float values as integers\n-  Ensure that all integer parameters are passed as integers, not floats. For example, when using the `connect_entities` function, make sure the positions are integers, not floats.\n\n### Errors when using undefined modules\n-  Make sure to import all necessary modules before using them. For example, the `math` module needs to be imported before using the `math.floor` function.\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n-  Ensure that the position where you are trying to place an entity is not occupied by another entity.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n*   Type-annotated utility functions:\n    *   `connect_entities`: Connects two entities using a pipe.\n    *   `get_entity`: Gets an entity at a specific position.\n*   Important variables:\n    *   `pump`: The offshore pump entity.\n    *   `boiler`: The boiler entity.\n    *   `steam_engine`: The steam engine entity.\n    *   `math`: The math module (not defined in the current scope)."}
