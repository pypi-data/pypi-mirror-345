{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-13.5, 20.0)\nConsists of boiler (position -13.5, 20.0) and offshore pump (position -10.5, 25.5). The boiler is currently out of fuel, while the offshore pump is operational.\n\n### Lab at position(x)\nConsists of a lab (position -21.5, 25.5). The lab is currently not powered.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(x)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace (position 5.0, -73.0) with coal as fuel and producing iron plates.\n- Furnace (position -18.0, -49.0) with coal as fuel and producing copper plates.\n\n### Pipe network\nConsists of multiple pipe groups:\n- PipeGroup (fluid system 50270) at position (-11.5, 21.5) is full of water.\n- PipeGroup (fluid system 50272) at position (-4.5, 21.5) is empty.\n- PipeGroup (fluid system 50273) at position (-4.5, 23.5) is empty.\n\n### Electricity network\nConsists of multiple small electric poles:\n- Small electric pole (position -15.5, 18.5)\n- Small electric pole (position -15.5, 19.5)\n- Small electric pole (position -15.5, 21.5)\n- Additional poles are present but not listed due to space.\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine (position -21.5, 25.5) is currently not receiving electricity.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to electric poles\n- Ensure that electric poles are placed in unoccupied tiles. Attempting to place poles in occupied positions will result in failure.\n- Verify that electric poles are properly connected to the electric network to power entities such as labs and assembling machines.\n\n### Errors when trying to pick up entities\n- Confirm the existence of the entity at the specified position before attempting to pick it up. If the entity cannot be found, it will lead to an error.\n\n### Errors when connecting to power\n- Ensure that all entities requiring power are connected to a functional electric network. If a lab or machine is not powered, check the connections and the status of nearby electric poles."}
