{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace (position (0.0, 0.0)) - Currently working and processing iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest (position (-14.5, -48.5)) - Contains iron ore, currently holding 689 items.\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position (42, -83)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position (42.0, -83.0)) - Currently out of fuel.\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position (-15, -50)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position (-15.0, -50.0)) - Currently out of fuel.\n\n### Inserters at position (42.5, -80.5) and (43.5, -81.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Inserter (position (42.5, -80.5)) - Waiting for source items.\n- Burner Inserter (position (43.5, -81.5)) - Waiting for space in destination.\n\n### Wooden Chest at position (42.5, -81.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest (position (42.5, -81.5)) - Currently holding coal, with 306 items.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to fuel supply\n- Ensure that all burner mining drills have sufficient fuel to operate. Regularly check the fuel status and refill as necessary.\n\n### Errors when using inserters\n- Inserters may wait for source items or space in the destination. Ensure that the source has items available and that the destination is not full.\n\n### Errors when extracting from chests\n- Make sure to extract items from chests that have sufficient quantities. Monitor the chest inventory to avoid running out of resources.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing it. Check the status of nearby entities to avoid conflicts.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n#### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the current execution steps.\n\n#### Important Variables\n- `iron_ore`: int - Represents the amount of iron ore extracted.\n- `coal`: int - Represents the amount of coal available for fueling.\n- `iron_plate`: int - Represents the amount of iron plates produced."}
