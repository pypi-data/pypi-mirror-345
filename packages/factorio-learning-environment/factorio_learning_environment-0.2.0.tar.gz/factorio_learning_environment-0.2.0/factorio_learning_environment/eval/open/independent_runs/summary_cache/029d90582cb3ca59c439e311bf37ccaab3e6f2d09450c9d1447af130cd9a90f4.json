{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-10.5, 23.0)\nConsists of:\n- Boiler at position (-10.5, 23.0)\n- Steam engine at position (-13.5, 24.5)\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 25.0)\nConsists of:\n- Boiler at position (-5.5, 25.0)\n- Steam engine at position (-0.5, 25.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace at position (15.0, 0.0)\n- Wooden chest at position (5.5, 0.5) containing iron ore\n- Inserters at positions (17.5, 0.5) and (16.5, 0.5) for transferring items\n- Small electric pole at position (17.5, -0.5) for power distribution\n\n### Pipe Network\nConsists of multiple pipe groups connecting various entities, including:\n- PipeGroup at position (-1.5, 17.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (0.5, 16.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (-6.5, 20.5)\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of:\n- Electricity poles at various positions including (1.5, 25.5), (11.5, 6.5), and (17.5, -0.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Pipes\n- Ensure the target location is free and suitable for pipe placement before attempting to place pipes. Adjust positions if necessary.\n\n### Errors when Connecting Boilers and Steam Engines\n- Make sure all components of the electricity generator are properly connected. Check connections between boilers, steam engines, and offshore pumps to ensure fluid flow.\n\n### Errors due to Distance Limitations\n- Move closer to the target location before placing entities. The maximum placement distance is 10 units.\n\n### Attribute Errors in Code\n- Verify that the correct attributes are being accessed in the code. For example, ensure that 'position' is used correctly and that objects have the expected attributes.\n\n### Inventory Errors\n- Ensure that the required entities, such as boilers and steam engines, are available in the inventory before attempting placement."}
