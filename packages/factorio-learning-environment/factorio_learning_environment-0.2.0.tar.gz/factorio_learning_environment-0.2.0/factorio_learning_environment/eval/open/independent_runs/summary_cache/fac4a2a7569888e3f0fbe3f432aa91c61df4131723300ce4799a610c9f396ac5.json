{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo structures have been created yet.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities without having them in inventory\n- Ensure that you have the required entity in your inventory before attempting to place it. For example, attempting to place a stone furnace at position (4.5, -73.5) failed because there was no stone furnace in the inventory.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient crafting materials\n- Verify that you have all necessary materials before crafting an item. For instance, crafting a stone furnace requires 5 stones, but the inventory had 0 stones, leading to an AssertionError. Always check material requirements against your current inventory."}
