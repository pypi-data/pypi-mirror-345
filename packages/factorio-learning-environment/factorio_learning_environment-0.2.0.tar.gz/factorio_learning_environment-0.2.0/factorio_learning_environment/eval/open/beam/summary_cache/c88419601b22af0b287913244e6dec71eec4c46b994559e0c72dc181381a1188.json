{"content": "I notice the key issue now - the mining drill needs a chest or other entity to output items to. Let's fix this by placing a chest first:\n\n```python\n# First place a wooden chest for the drill's output\nchest = place_entity(\n    Prototype.WoodenChest,\n    position=Position(x=-18.5, y=21.5)  # This is where the drill wants to output\n)\nprint(f\"Placed chest at: {chest.position}\")\n\n# Now place the mining drill\ndrill = place_entity(\n    Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill,\n    position=Position(x=-17.5, y=20.5),\n    direction=Direction.RIGHT\n)\nprint(f\"Placed mining drill at: {drill.position}\")\n\n# Add coal to power the drill\ninsert_item(Prototype.Coal, drill, quantity=5)\nprint(\"Added fuel to mining drill\")\n\n# Check our setup\nprint(f\"Mining drill status: {drill.status}\")\n```\n\nThe key insights from previous attempts:\n1. The mining drill needs a clear output location (warning showed: \"waiting for space in destination\")\n2. The drill needs to be placed on iron ore\n3. The drill needs fuel to operate\n4. The output position needs to be at (-18.5, 21.5) based on the warning message\n\nLet me try this revised approach with the chest placement first. Would you like me to proceed?", "summary_range": "[1-2634]"}
