{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-14.5, -64.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -64.5) serving as the source for the inserter.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-15.5, -64.5) transferring items from the wooden chest to another wooden chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-16.5, -64.5) receiving iron plates from the inserter.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining Operation at Position (-23.0, -68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) extracting copper ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-23.5, -69.5) storing extracted copper ore.\n- Transport Belt system connecting the mining drill to the wooden chest.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Operation at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -54.5) storing extracted iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5) transferring items from the wooden chest to another wooden chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-12.5, -54.5) receiving iron ore from the inserter.\n\n### Smelting Facility at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) smelting copper ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5) storing smelted iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) transferring items from the wooden chest to another wooden chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (3.5, 0.5) receiving items from the inserter.\n\n### Belt Systems\nVarious belt groups are present to facilitate the transportation of materials between different parts of the operations. These belts are strategically placed to connect mining drills, furnaces, and chests.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source chest or entity contains items for the inserter to transfer. Regularly check and replenish the source inventory to keep the inserter operational.\n\n### Out of Fuel Warnings\n- Regularly refuel burner mining drills and inserters to prevent them from stopping due to lack of fuel. Consider setting up automated fuel supply lines if possible.\n\n### No Ingredients to Smelt Warnings\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Regularly supply them with the required ores to maintain continuous production.\n\n### Furnace Result is Full Warnings\n- Regularly empty the furnace output to prevent production halts. Use inserters to automate the transfer of smelted items to chests or belts."}
