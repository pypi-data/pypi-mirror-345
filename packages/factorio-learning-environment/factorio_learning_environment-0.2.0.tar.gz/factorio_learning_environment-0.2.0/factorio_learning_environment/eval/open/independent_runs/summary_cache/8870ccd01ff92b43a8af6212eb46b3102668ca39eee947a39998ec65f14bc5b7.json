{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position (52.5, 51.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam engine (position 52.5, 51.5) - Currently not connected to the power network and has no input liquid or fluid present in connections.\n- Small electric poles (positions 50.5, 50.5), (50.5, 51.5), (54.5, 51.5) - These poles are intended to provide power to nearby entities.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position (1.0, 1.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 1.0, 1.0) and a furnace (position 1.0, 1.0) - Currently, the furnace has no ingredients to smelt.\n  \n### Additional Structures\n- **Furnaces and Chests**:\n  - Furnace (position 10.0, 1.0) - Currently out of fuel.\n  - Burner Inserter (position 8.5, 1.5) - Currently out of fuel.\n  - Wooden chests at positions (3.5, 1.5), (3.5, 3.5), and (3.5, 5.5) - These chests contain various items including iron plates.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with electricity generator connection\n- Ensure that the steam engine is properly connected to the power network. Check the surrounding electric poles and their connections.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into entities\n- The steam engine is not accepting coal due to being not connected or having no available space. Verify the steam engine's status and ensure it is connected to a valid power source before attempting to insert fuel.\n\n### Errors related to crafting and inventory management\n- While crafting additional small electric poles, ensure that you have enough resources available. Monitor your inventory to avoid running out of necessary materials.\n\n### General placement errors\n- Ensure that entities are placed in valid positions and are not overlapping with other entities. Check the tile before placing new entities to avoid placement errors."}
