{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing Facility at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (41.0, -82.0) extracting coal.\n- Stone Furnace at Position (43.0, -82.0) for smelting operations.\n- Iron Chests at Positions (41.5, -80.5) and (42.5, -80.5) for storage.\n- Burner Inserters at Positions (43.5, -80.5) for transferring items between entities.\n- Wooden Chest at Position (41.5, -79.5) for additional storage.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-15.0, -50.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Stone Furnaces at Positions (-13.0, -48.0), (-11.0, -48.0), and (-9.0, -48.0) for smelting iron ore.\n- Iron Chests at Positions (-18.5, -48.5), (-16.5, -48.5), (-15.5, -48.5), and (-13.5, -49.5) for storage.\n- Wooden Chests at Positions (-14.5, -48.5), (-12.5, -49.5), and (-9.5, -49.5) for additional storage.\n- Burner Inserters at Positions (-10.5, -49.5), (-11.5, -49.5), and (-8.5, -49.5) for item transfer between entities.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage and Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chests at Positions (-10.5, -45.5) and (-11.5, -45.5) for storing iron plates.\n- Burner Inserters at Positions (-12.5, -44.5), (-10.5, -44.5), and (-8.5, -44.5) for transferring iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Items\n- Ensure that the upstream supply of items is consistent and sufficient to prevent inserters from idling. Check the supply chain to ensure that resources are being fed into the system without bottlenecks.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Space in Destination\n- Make sure that the destination entities (e.g., chests or furnaces) have enough space to accommodate incoming items. Regularly clear out or expand storage to prevent blockages.\n\n### Chest Full Warning\n- Regularly monitor and empty chests that are full to ensure continuous operation of mining drills and other production facilities. Consider expanding storage capacity if the issue persists."}
