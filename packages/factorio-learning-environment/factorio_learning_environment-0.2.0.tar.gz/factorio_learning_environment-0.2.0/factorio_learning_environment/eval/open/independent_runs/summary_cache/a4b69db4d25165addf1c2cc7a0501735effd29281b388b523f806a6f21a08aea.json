{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nThis structure is set up to mine and process iron ore. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0), which extracts iron ore and deposits it into a nearby chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5), which stores the mined iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5), which is intended to transfer iron ore from the chest to the furnace. It requires proper alignment and fuel to operate efficiently.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0), which is supposed to smelt the iron ore into iron plates. However, it is currently not receiving iron ore due to misalignment issues with the inserter.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Alignment Issues\n- Ensure that the inserter's pickup and drop positions are correctly aligned with the chest and the furnace. Misalignment can prevent the inserter from transferring items, as observed with the inserter at position (-13.5, -48.5).\n\n### Fuel Management\n- Regularly check and refuel entities such as the burner mining drill and burner inserter to maintain continuous operation. The inserter at position (-13.5, -48.5) frequently runs out of fuel, causing interruptions in the transfer process.\n\n### Coal Shortages\n- Monitor coal levels closely and consider mining more coal or redistributing existing coal to ensure that all fuel-dependent entities remain operational. Low coal levels have been noted, which could impact the efficiency of the mining and smelting processes.\n\n### Inventory Management\n- Verify that you have the necessary resources in your inventory before attempting to insert items into entities. An error was encountered while trying to insert coal into an inserter due to a lack of coal in the inventory."}
