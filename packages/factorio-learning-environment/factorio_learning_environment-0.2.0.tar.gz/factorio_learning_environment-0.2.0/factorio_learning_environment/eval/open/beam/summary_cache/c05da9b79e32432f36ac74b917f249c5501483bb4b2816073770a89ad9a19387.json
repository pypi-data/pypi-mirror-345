{"content": "The error indicates that there was an attempt to inspect the inventory of a `boiler` entity that couldn't be found at the specified coordinates. This suggests that the boiler might not be correctly placed or identified in the environment.\n\nLet's address this by ensuring the boiler is correctly placed and identified, and by handling the inventory checks more robustly:\n\n```python\ntry:\n    # Ensure entities are correctly identified\n    offshore_pump = get_entities({Prototype.OffshorePump})[0]\n    boiler = get_entities({Prototype.Boiler})[0]\n    steam_engine = get_entities({Prototype.SteamEngine})[0]\n    assembling_machine = get_entities({Prototype.AssemblingMachine1})[0]\n\n    # Check and craft pipes if necessary\n    required_pipes = 7\n    current_pipes = inspect_inventory().get(Prototype.Pipe, 0)\n\n    if current_pipes < required_pipes:\n        pipes_to_craft = required_pipes - current_pipes\n        craft_item(Prototype.Pipe, pipes_to_craft)\n        print(f\"Crafted {pipes_to_craft} additional pipes to meet connection requirements.\")\n\n    # Attempt to connect offshore pump to boiler\n    if not connect_entities(offshore_pump, boiler):\n        print(\"Failed to connect Offshore Pump to Boiler.

If an entity cannot be found, handle it gracefully.\n2. **Pipe Crafting**: Check and craft the necessary number of pipes before attempting connections.\n3. **Fuel Check**: Ensure the boiler is properly fueled. If the inventory check fails, verify the boiler's position and existence.\n4. **Connection Logic**: Ensure all connections are attempted and verified, with clear error messages if they fail.\n5. **Error Handling**: Use try-except blocks to catch and report errors effectively.", "summary_range": "[1-264]"}
