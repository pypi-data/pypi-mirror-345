{"content": "I'll create a new report based on the provided logs.\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n###Coal Mining and Storage Setup (around x=41, y=-82)\n- Burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0) mining coal\n- Multiple storage chests:\n  - Iron chest at (41.5, -84.5) storing coal\n  - Iron chest at (41.5, -83.5) storing coal\n  - Wooden chest at (41.5, -80.5) as intermediate storage\n\n###Coal Transport System (around x=42-45, y=-80 to -83)\n- Burner inserter at (42.5, -80.5) moving coal from wooden chest to belt system\n- Belt transport system consisting of:\n  - Belt at (43.5, -80.5)\n  - Belt at (43.5, -81.5)\n  - Belt at (43.5, -82.5)\n- Furnace input inserter at (45.5, -82.5)\n\n###Furnace Setup (around x=45-47, y=-81)\n- Two stone furnaces:\n  - First furnace at (45.0, -81.0)\n  - Second furnace at (47.0, -81.0)\n- Output storage: Wooden chest at (49.5, -80.5) containing iron plates\n\nERROR TIPS\n1. Entity Placement Conflicts\n- Always check for existing entities before placing new ones\n- Common errors occurred when trying to place transport belts and inserters where other entities already existed\n- Ensure proper spacing between components when designing factory layouts\n\n2. Belt System Issues\n- Transport belt blockages are preventing smooth operation\n- Clear blocked belts (specifically at 43.5, -80.5) to maintain production flow\n\n3. Resource Management\n- Mining drill occasionally running out of fuel\n- Implement better fuel management systems to maintain continuous operation\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nImportant Variables:\n- furnace_inserter: BurnerInserter\n- chest_inserter: BurnerInserter\n- mining_drill: BurnerMiningDrill\n- transport_belt: TransportBelt\n\nEntity States:\n- EntityStatus.WORKING: Operating normally\n- EntityStatus.WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION: Output blocked\n- EntityStatus.WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS: No input items\n- EntityStatus.NO_INGREDIENTS: Missing required materials\n- EntityStatus.NO_FUEL: Requires fuel to operate"}
