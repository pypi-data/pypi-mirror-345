{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-11.5, 18.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position -11.5, 18.5), boiler (position -11.5, 25.0), and offshore pump (position -9.5, 24.5). This structure is responsible for generating electricity using steam.\n\n### Copper plate furnace at position(0, 0) and position(5, 5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace (position 0, 0) which is currently smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Furnace (position 5, 5) which is currently smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to smelting timeout\n- Ensure that both furnaces have sufficient fuel and inputs before initiating the smelting process. Check the inventory of each furnace to confirm they have the required materials.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
