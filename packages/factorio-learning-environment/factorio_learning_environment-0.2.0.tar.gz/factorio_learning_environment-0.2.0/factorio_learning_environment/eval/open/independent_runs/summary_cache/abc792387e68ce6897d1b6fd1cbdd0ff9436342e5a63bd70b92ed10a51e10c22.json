{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-9.5, 24.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Steam Engine at position (-12.5, 24.5)\n- Boiler at position (-5.5, 25.0)\n- Pipe connections between the steam engine, boiler, and offshore pump\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (15.0, 0.0)\n- Inserter at position (16.5, 0.5) connected to the stone furnace\n- Inserter at position (17.5, 0.5) connected to a wooden chest\n- Wooden Chest at position (18.5, 0.5)\n\n### Power Distribution Network\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Small Electric Poles at various positions including (1.5, 25.5), (15.5, 2.5), (17.5, -0.5), etc.\n- Electricity Group with ID 107857\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Steam Engine and Boiler Not Connected\n- Ensure that the steam engine and boiler are properly connected with pipes to allow fluid flow. Verify that the offshore pump is correctly positioned to supply water to the boiler.\n\n### Inserter No Power Error\n- Connect inserters to a power source such as small electric poles to ensure they receive electricity.\n\n### Offshore Pump Placement Redundancy\n- Avoid placing multiple offshore pumps at the same position repeatedly. Ensure that the pump is correctly connected to the fluid system to supply water.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the inserters have access to source items by checking their pickup positions and ensuring they are connected to a source of items.\n\n### Errors with No Fluid Present in Connections\n- Verify that all fluid connections are properly established and that the fluid system is complete and operational. Ensure that the offshore pump is actively supplying water to the connected systems."}
