{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron gear wheel production line at position around (16.0, 71.0) to (21.5, 73.5)  \nConsists of the following connected entities forming a production chain for iron gear wheels:  \n- Burner mining drill at position (16.0, 71.0), currently out of fuel  \n- Stone furnace at position (17.0, 73.0), currently out of fuel and empty inventories  \n- Burner inserters at positions (17.5, 71.5), (19.5, 73.5), and (23.5, 73.5), all out of fuel except (23.5, 73.5) which was recently refueled  \n- Wooden chest at position (18.5, 73.5), empty  \n- Assembling machine 2 at position (21.5, 73.5), not receiving electricity and currently has no recipe set  \n- Small electric poles at positions (21.5, 75.5), (18.5, 72.5), (18.5, 75.5), and newly connected pole at (19.5, 74.5) intended to power the assembler  \n- Power generation setup including a boiler and steam engine placed but no offshore pump due to inventory shortage, preventing full power network activation  \n\nThis structure integrates mining, smelting, assembling, and storage within a compact area, connected by inserters and electric poles. Recent actions included clearing furnace output, harvesting and inserting coal into inserters and furnace, setting assembler recipe, and partial power network expansion. However, the assembling machine remains unpowered due to incomplete power generation infrastructure, and fuel shortages persist in several burner entities.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to power generation and assembler power supply  \n- The assembling machine remains without power despite placing additional electric poles and a boiler/steam engine pair.  \n- No offshore pump was placed due to lack of inventory, preventing the steam engine from functioning and thus no power generation.  \n- Ensure all components of the steam power setup (offshore pump, boiler, steam engine) are available in inventory and placed correctly to establish a working power network.  \n- Verify that the electric poles form a continuous powered network including the assembler and inserters.  \n\n### Errors due to missing or insufficient fuel in burner entities  \n- Burner mining drill and multiple burner inserters run out of coal fuel, halting their operation.  \n- Attempts to insert coal into burner inserters sometimes fail due to insufficient coal in inventory at the time of insertion.  \n- Maintain a sufficient coal stockpile in inventory and prioritize refueling burner entities to keep production flowing.  \n- Consider automating fuel supply or switching to electric inserters once power is stable.  \n\n### Errors inserting items into assembling machine without recipe set  \n- Attempts to insert iron plates into the assembling machine fail because no recipe is set.  \n- Always set the assembling machine\u2019s recipe before inserting materials to avoid insertion errors.  \n\n### Errors related to entity placement failures due to inventory shortages  \n- Attempts to place offshore pumps fail repeatedly because none are present in inventory.  \n- Before placing critical entities, confirm their availability in inventory to avoid failed placement attempts and wasted actions.  \n\n### Errors related to blocked outputs and full inventories (unchanged)  \n- Previously observed blocked outputs and full inventories causing production halts remain relevant.  \n- Continue to monitor downstream capacity and clear inventories to prevent bottlenecks.  \n\nNAMESPACE\n\nNo user-defined functions have been defined in the current steps."}
