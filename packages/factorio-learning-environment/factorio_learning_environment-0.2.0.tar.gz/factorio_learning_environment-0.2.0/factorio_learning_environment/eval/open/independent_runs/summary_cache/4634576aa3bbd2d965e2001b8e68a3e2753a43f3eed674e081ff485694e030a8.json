{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Plate Smelting Setup at Position(x=52.0, y=-79.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at Position(x=52.0, y=-79.0)\n- **Burner Inserter** at Position(x=53.5, y=-79.5) (out of fuel)\n- **Wooden Chest** at Position(x=54.5, y=-79.5) (contains iron plates)\n\n#### Iron Ore Mining Setup at Position(x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at Position(x=-15.0, y=-50.0) (out of fuel)\n- **Wooden Chest** at Position(x=-14.5, y=-48.5) (empty)\n- **Burner Inserter** at Position(x=-13.5, y=-48.5) (waiting for source items)\n- **Burner Inserter** at Position(x=-12.5, y=-48.5) (waiting for source items)\n\n#### Storage Area at Position(x=0.5, y=0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Wooden Chest** at Position(x=0.5, y=0.5) (contains various items)\n- **Wooden Chest** at Position(x=1.5, y=0.5) (contains various items)\n- **Wooden Chest** at Position(x=2.5, y=0.5) (contains coal)\n- **Wooden Chest** at Position(x=3.5, y=0.5) (contains coal)\n- **Wooden Chest** at Position(x=4.5, y=0.5) (contains coal and iron ore)\n- **Wooden Chest** at Position(x=5.5, y=0.5) (contains iron ore, iron plates, and iron gear wheels)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Mining Drill Not Working\n- **Error**: The mining drill at Position(x=-15.0, y=-50.0) is not working due to lack of fuel and a full chest at the drop position.\n- **Tip**: Ensure the mining drill has sufficient fuel and that the chest at the drop position is not full. Empty the chest or provide additional storage to allow the drill to continue mining.\n\n#### Burner Inserter Out of Fuel\n- **Error**: The burner inserter at Position(x=53.5, y=-79.5) is out of fuel.\n- **Tip**: Ensure all burner inserters have sufficient fuel to operate. Regularly check and refuel burner inserters to maintain continuous operation.\n\n#### Furnace No Ingredients\n- **Error**: The stone furnace at Position(x=52.0, y=-79.0) has no ingredients to smelt.\n- **Tip**: Ensure the furnace is supplied with the necessary raw materials (e.g., iron ore) and that inserters are functioning correctly to feed the furnace.\n\n#### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- **Error**: The burner inserter at Position(x=42.5, y=-80.5) is waiting for source items.\n- **Tip**: Ensure the source chest has the required items and that the inserter is correctly positioned to pick up items. Check for any obstructions or misconfigurations in the setup.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n#### Utility Functions\n- **None defined yet**\n\n#### Important Variables\n- **None assigned yet**"}
