{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing Facility at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (41.0, -82.0) extracting coal.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (43.0, -82.0) for smelting operations.\n- **Iron Chests** at positions (41.5, -80.5), (42.5, -80.5), (44.5, -80.5), (45.5, -80.5), (47.5, -80.5), and (49.5, -80.5) for storing coal and iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserters** at positions (43.5, -80.5) for transferring items between chests and furnaces.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (41.5, -79.5) for additional coal storage.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) extracting iron ore.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (-13.0, -48.0), (-11.0, -48.0), and (-9.0, -48.0) for smelting iron ore.\n- **Iron Chests** at positions (-18.5, -48.5), (-16.5, -48.5), (-15.5, -48.5), (-14.5, -48.5), (-13.5, -49.5), and (-14.5, -47.5) for storing iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserters** at positions (-11.5, -49.5), (-10.5, -49.5), (-8.5, -49.5), (-7.5, -48.5) for transferring items between chests and furnaces.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-12.5, -49.5), (-11.5, -45.5), and (-10.5, -45.5) for storing iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserters Waiting for Items\n- **Issue**: Inserters at positions (-12.5, -44.5), (-10.5, -44.5), and (-8.5, -44.5) are waiting for items.\n- **Solution**: Ensure that the upstream supply of items is consistent and sufficient to keep the inserters operational.\n\n### Full Chests Preventing Mining Operations\n- **Issue**: Chests at drop positions are full, preventing mining operations from continuing at positions (41.5, -80.5) and (-14.5, -48.5).\n- **Solution**: Regularly clear out full chests to ensure continuous mining operations.\n\n### Failed to Clear Drop Position Chests\n- **Issue**: Failed to clear drop position chests due to extraction issues.\n- **Solution**: Verify that there is enough space in the inventory or adjacent chests to accommodate extracted items."}
