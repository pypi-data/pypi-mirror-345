The agent made several attempts to deploy a Lab at (0.5, 2.5) for supplying Automation Science Packs, but none of these attempts completed due to resource shortages and API misuses. Although the agent interacted with existing smelting facilities (an iron furnace at Position(x=5.0, y=5.0) and a copper furnace at Position(x=-27.0, y=-60.0)) for resource processing, no composite or newly placed structure was produced on the map.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 API Usage Errors for Entity Retrieval  \n  - Use the correct function signature for get_entities. Avoid supplying unexpected keyword arguments (such as \u201cradius\u201d) or an incorrect number of positional arguments.\n\n\u2022 Lab Crafting and Placement Failures  \n  - Verify that the Lab is present in the inventory before attempting placement.  \n  - When using fallbacks, ensure that functions return an empty iterable instead of None to prevent \u201cNoneType is not iterable\u201d errors.  \n  - Review and secure the complete chain of required sub-ingredients (e.g. iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, and copper-cables) before initiating Lab crafting.\n\n\u2022 Resource Shortage Issues in Complex Crafting  \n  - Ensure that sufficient raw and intermediate resources (such as additional iron plates and copper plates) are produced ahead of crafting complex items like the Lab.  \n  - Scale up necessary production steps (e.g. smelting operations) to meet the ingredient requirements and avoid missing components such as iron-gear-wheels."}
