{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and transfers it to a nearby wooden chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates, but currently not receiving iron ore due to inserter setup issues.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors When Placing Entities\n- Ensure that there is enough space and no collisions with existing entities when placing new entities. Consider adjusting the spacing, direction, or reference position to avoid placement errors.\n\n### Inserter Setup Errors\n- Verify that the inserter is correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items between entities. Check both the pickup and drop positions to ensure they are correctly set up to facilitate the transfer of materials.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Ingredients\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly configured and operational to deliver the necessary ingredients to the furnace. Check for any misalignment or fuel issues that may prevent the inserter from functioning properly.\n\n### Refueling Errors\n- Regularly check and refuel entities like mining drills and inserters to maintain continuous operation and avoid interruptions in the production process."}
