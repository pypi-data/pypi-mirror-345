{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=4.0, y=-60.0) extracting iron ore, with a drop position at (x=4.5, y=-58.5). The drill is currently operational but unable to continue due to a full chest at the drop position.\n- **Wooden Chests** for storage:\n  - Chest at position (x=4.5, y=-58.5) containing iron ore.\n  - Additional chests at positions (x=5.5, y=-60.5), (x=7.5, y=-60.5), (x=6.5, y=-60.5), (x=9.5, y=-60.5), and (x=8.5, y=-60.5) are empty.\n- **Furnaces** for smelting iron ore into iron plates:\n  - Furnace at position (x=-15.0, y=-48.0) currently working with coal as fuel and iron ore as input.\n  - Furnace at position (x=-13.0, y=-48.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n  - Furnace at position (x=-11.0, y=-48.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Full Output and No Ingredients Warnings\n- Ensure that the output of furnaces is regularly cleared to prevent them from reaching a full output status.\n- Maintain a steady supply of ingredients (iron ore) to furnaces to avoid the \"no ingredients to smelt\" warning.\n\n### Chest Full Warning\n- Regularly empty the chest at position (x=4.5, y=-58.5) to allow the burner mining drill to continue its operation without interruption.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined by the agent in the provided logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `wooden-chest`: int = 3\n- `iron-plate`: int = 1475\n- `iron-gear-wheel`: int = 4"}
