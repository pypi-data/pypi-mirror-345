{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report - Steps 0-79\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation (Water -> Steam -> Electricity) with Automated Coal Fueling\n*   **Purpose:** Generates electricity from water using coal as fuel, with an automated system to transport coal from the main coal mine.\n*   **Components:**\n    *   Offshore Pump at x=-9.5 y=-0.5 (Extracts water, Status: WORKING)\n    *   Boiler at x=-5.0 y=2.5 (Heats water to steam using coal, Status: NO_FUEL)\n    *   Steam Engine at x=0.5 y=6.5 (Generates electricity from steam, Status: NOT_CONNECTED - no fluid, no power network connection)\n    *   PipeGroup connecting Offshore Pump to Boiler (fluid_system=18498, fluid=water, status=FULL_OUTPUT)\n    *   PipeGroup connecting Boiler to Steam Engine (fluid_system=18505, status=EMPTY)\n    *   **Boiler Fueling Subsystem:**\n        *   Wooden Chest (Fuel Buffer) at x=-3.5 y=7.5 (Status: NORMAL, Inventory: Empty)\n        *   Inserter (Belt -> Fuel Chest) at x=-3.5 y=8.5 (Picks from belt at x=-3.5 y=9.5, Drops to chest at x=-3.5 y=7.5, Status: NO_POWER)\n        *   Inserter (Fuel Chest -> Boiler) at x=-3.5 y=6.5 (Picks from chest at x=-3.5 y=7.5, Drops towards boiler input at x=-3.5 y=5.5, Status: NO_POWER)\n        *   Small Electric Pole at x=-1.0 y=9.0 (Connects inserters to power grid)\n*   **Updates:**\n    *   A wooden chest was placed at x=-3.5 y=7.5 to buffer coal for the boiler (Step 73).\n    *   Two inserters were placed to move coal from a transport belt into the chest (x=-3.5 y=8.5) and from the chest into the boiler (x=-3.5 y=6.5) (Steps 73, 74).\n    *   The boiler was manually bootstrapped with coal multiple times (Steps 74, 76, 77), but repeatedly ran out of fuel, indicating the automated system is not yet functional.\n    *   Power poles were placed and connected to power the inserters (Steps"}
