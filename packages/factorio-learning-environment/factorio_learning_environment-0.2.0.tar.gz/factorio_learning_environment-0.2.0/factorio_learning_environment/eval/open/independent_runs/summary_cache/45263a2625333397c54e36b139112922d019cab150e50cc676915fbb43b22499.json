{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0): Extracts iron ore and deposits it into a nearby chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5): Stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-15.5, y=-48.5): Additional storage for extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5): Transfers items between the chests.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0): Processes iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities into occupied tiles\n- Ensure there is enough space before placing an entity. If a tile is occupied by another entity, consider increasing the spacing, changing the direction, or changing the reference position.\n\n### Errors due to collisions with existing entities\n- Before placing an entity, verify that the intended position is free from other entities or obstacles. If a collision occurs, adjust the spacing or direction to avoid overlap.\n\n### Errors when placing entities on unsuitable terrain\n- Check the terrain suitability for placing entities. Avoid placing entities on water or other unsuitable surfaces. Adjust the placement strategy accordingly.\n\n### Errors when entities run out of fuel\n- Regularly refuel entities such as mining drills and inserters to ensure continuous operation. Monitor fuel levels and replenish as necessary to avoid interruptions.\n\n### Errors due to full storage\n- Ensure that storage entities like chests have enough space to accommodate incoming items. Regularly transfer items from full chests to prevent operational halts."}
