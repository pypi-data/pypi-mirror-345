Do not pass unexpected keyword arguments like \"radius\" or an incorrect number of positional arguments.\n  \n- Lab placement and crafting errors:\n  - Ensure a lab is available in inventory before attempting to place it.\n  - When retrieving lab entities, verify that the result is a valid list (use an empty list if no entities are found) to avoid iteration over a None value.\n  - Confirm that all required sub-ingredients (such as iron-gear-wheel, electronic-circuit, and copper-cable) are available and their crafting chains are fully supported before attempting lab production."}
