{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) fueled with coal, extracting iron ore.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0), used for smelting iron ore into iron plates. Currently fueled with coal and contains iron ore and iron plates.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) and (x=-15.5, y=-48.5), used for storing iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserters**:\n  - At position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5), transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n  - At position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5), transferring items between chests and the furnace.\n\n### Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-46.5), used for storing iron ore and iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items without having them in inventory\n- Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. For example, attempting to insert coal into a mining drill without having coal in the inventory will result in an error.\n\n### Inserter Errors\n- Ensure that the inserters have a clear path to transfer items. Inserters waiting for source items or having blocked drop positions can cause production delays. Check that the destination is not full and that the source has items available."}
