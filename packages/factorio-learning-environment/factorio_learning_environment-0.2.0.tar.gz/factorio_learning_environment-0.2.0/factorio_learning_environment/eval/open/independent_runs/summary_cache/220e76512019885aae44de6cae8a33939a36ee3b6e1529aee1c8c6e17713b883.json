{"content": "# FACTORIO REPORT\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System at position (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump (position x=-9.5, y=-0.5)\n- Boiler (position x=-5.0, y=2.5)\n- Steam engine (position x=0.5, y=6.5)\n- Pipe network connecting these components\n- Central power pole (position x=0.5, y=10.5)\n\nThis structure generates electricity for the factory by pumping water from a nearby water source, heating it in the boiler using coal to produce steam, which then powers the steam engine. The agent has been regularly adding coal to the boiler to maintain power generation, with a throughput of approximately 285-348 water/steam per minute when operating properly. The boiler currently has 13 coal and is working properly.\n\n### Stone Mining Operation at position (-50.0, 13.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill 1 (position x=-48.5, y=7.5) with wooden chest (position x=-48.5, y=9.5)\n- Electric mining drill 2 (position x=-51.5, y=12.5) with wooden chest (position x=-51.5, y=14.5)\n- Electric mining drill 3 (position x=-48.5, y=16.5) with wooden chest (position x=-48.5, y=18.5)\n- Electric mining drill 4 (position x=-52.5, y=18.5) with wooden chest (position x=-52.5, y=20.5)\n- Small electric poles connecting the drills to the power network\n\nThis structure mines stone from several stone patches and deposits it into adjacent wooden chests for storage. The mining operation produces stone at varying rates between 52-80 stone per minute when operational. Current stone amounts in chests:\n- Chest at x=-48.5, y=9.5: 705 stone\n- Chest at x=-51.5, y=14.5: 800 stone (full)\n- Chest at x=-48.5, y=18.5: 758 stone\n- Chest at x=-52.5, y=20.5: 800 stone (full)\n\nTwo of the mining drills have warnings that their output chests are full and are waiting for space in destination.\n\n### Stone Brick Production Line at position (-20.0, 35.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace 1 (position x=-30.0, y=35.0) with output inserter (position x=-29.5, y=36.5)\n- Stone furnace 2 (position x=-25.0, y=35.0) with output inserter (position x=-24.5, y=36.5)\n- Stone furnace 3 (position x=-20.0, y=35.0) with output inserter (position x=-19.5, y=36.5)\n- Stone furnace 4 (position x=-15.0, y=35.0) with output inserter (position x=-14.5, y=36.5)\n- Stone furnace 5 (position x=-10.0, y=35.0) with output inserter (position x=-9.5, y=36.5)\n- Input belt segments at x=-34.5, y=33.5 and other positions\n- Output belt segments at x=-34.5, y=37.5 and other positions\n- Small electric poles powering the inserters at positions x=-23.5, y=36.5; x=-18.5, y=36.5; and x=-13.5, y=36.5\n- Transport belts at positions x=-29.5, y=37.5; x=-24.5, y=37.5; x=-19.5, y=37.5; x=-14.5, y=37.5; and x=-9.5, y=37.5 to receive stone bricks from inserters\n- Stone brick collection chest (position x=-19.5, y=38.5)\n- Inserter at x=-19.5, y=39.5 to move stone bricks from collection chest to belt\n- Transport belt line from x=-19.5, y=40.5 to x=-19.5, y=45.5"}
