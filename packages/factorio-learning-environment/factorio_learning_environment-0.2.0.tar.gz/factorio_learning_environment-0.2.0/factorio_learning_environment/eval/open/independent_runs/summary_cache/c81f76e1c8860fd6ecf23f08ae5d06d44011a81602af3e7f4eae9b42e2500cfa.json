{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo new structures have been successfully placed on the map. Multiple attempts were made to craft and position a Lab at (0.5, 2.5), but none succeeded because of inventory shortages and unresolved production dependencies. Although pre\u2010existing smelting facilities were utilized (an alternative furnace at (5.0, 5.0) for iron plate production and a copper furnace at (\u201327.0, \u201360.0) for copper plate production), these were not built by the agent during these steps.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 API Call Consistency \u2013 When using get_entities, ensure the call conforms to its defined signature. Avoid unsupported keyword arguments (e.g. \u201cradius\u201d) and confirm whether parameters should be positional or keyword to prevent unexpected argument errors.\n\u2022 Placement and Iteration Checks \u2013 Before attempting to place an entity such as a Lab, verify that the item exists in inventory. Additionally, validate that any returned list from an API call is not None before iterating.\n\u2022 Crafting Dependency Verification \u2013 For complex items like the Lab, ensure all prerequisite materials (for instance, iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, and copper-cables) can be produced. Establish that base production (such as smelting of iron and copper plates) is sufficient to support these multi-step recipes, and double-check ingredient counts before attempting a craft."}
