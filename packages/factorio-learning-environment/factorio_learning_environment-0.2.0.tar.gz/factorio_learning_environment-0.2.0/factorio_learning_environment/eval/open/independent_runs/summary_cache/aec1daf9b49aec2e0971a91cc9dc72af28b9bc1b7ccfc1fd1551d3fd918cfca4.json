{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 19.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (-5.5, 19.5)\n- Boiler at position (-2.5, 24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe Group connecting various components:\n  - Pipe at position (-5.5, 16.5)\n  - Pipe at position (-8.5, 23.5)\n- Small Electric Poles for electricity distribution:\n  - Small Electric Pole at position (-0.5, 22.5)\n  - Small Electric Pole at position (3.5, 23.5)\n  - Small Electric Pole at position (-8.5, 22.5)\n  - Small Electric Pole at position (-8.5, 21.5)\n  - Small Electric Pole at position (-8.5, 20.5)\n\n### Stone Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) is currently not operational due to lack of ingredients.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Fuel and Ingredients\n- Ensure that the boiler is consistently supplied with fuel (coal) to maintain its operation.\n- The stone furnace needs ingredients to function; ensure that necessary materials are available.\n\n### Errors in Electricity Network Connection\n- The electricity group is not plugged into the electric network. Ensure all electric poles are properly connected to form a continuous network.\n- Always check the inventory for the availability of small electric poles before attempting to place or connect them.\n\n### Errors in Inventory Management\n- Ensure that there is coal available in the inventory before attempting to insert it into the boiler.\n- Harvest or gather necessary raw materials, such as wood, before crafting items that require them.\n\n### Crafting Errors\n- When crafting items, ensure all required sub-ingredients are available. For example, wood is a raw resource that must be gathered before crafting small electric poles.\n\n### Placement Errors\n- Before placing entities like small electric poles, verify that the inventory contains the required items to avoid placement failures."}
