{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-25.5, 20.0)\nConsists of boiler (position -25.5, 20.0) and steam engine (position -18.5, 19.5). The boiler is intended to convert water into steam, which powers the steam engine to generate electricity.\n\n### Offshore pump at position(-11.5, 26.5)\nConsists of offshore pump (position -11.5, 26.5) which is used to extract water from the sea for various purposes, such as supplying the boiler.\n\n### Lab at position(-17.5, 23.5)\nConsists of lab (position -17.5, 23.5) which is used for research and development of technologies.\n\n### Copper plate factory at position(-18.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position -18.0, -49.0) and a furnace (position -18.0, -49.0) for processing copper ore into copper plates.\n\n### Iron plate factory at position(5.0, -73.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 5.0, -73.0) and a furnace (position 5.0, -73.0) for processing iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Assembling machine at position(-21.5, 25.5)\nConsists of assembling machine (position -21.5, 25.5) which is used for crafting items, specifically automation science packs.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to boiler and steam engine connection\n- Ensure that the boiler is connected to a suitable pipe group that can provide water. Check the pipe connections and ensure they are not blocked or disconnected.\n- Verify that the steam engine is connected to the boiler and that there is a proper flow of steam. Ensure that the boiler has water input and is operational before attempting to connect the steam engine.\n\n### Errors when using pipes\n- Make sure to connect pipes correctly to avoid issues with fluid flow. Check the status of pipe groups and ensure they are not empty or not suitable for the intended connection.\n\n### Errors when using electricity\n- Ensure that all electrical connections are properly established. Check for any disconnected poles or power sources that may prevent machines from receiving electricity.\n\n### General placement errors\n- Ensure you can place an entity in a tile before attempting to place it. Verify that the tile is not occupied by another entity."}
