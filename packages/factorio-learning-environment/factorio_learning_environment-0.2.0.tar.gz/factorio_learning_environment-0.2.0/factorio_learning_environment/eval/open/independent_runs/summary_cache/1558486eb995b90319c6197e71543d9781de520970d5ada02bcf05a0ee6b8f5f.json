{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=10.5, y=34.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam engine at position (x=10.5, y=34.5), currently not connected to the power network and lacking input liquid.\n- Boiler at position (x=5.5, y=27.0), not connected to any fluid system, with no input liquid.\n- Offshore pump at position (x=-7.5, y=25.5), working and connected to a series of pipes.\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine, with various pipe groups at positions such as (x=-14.5, y=14.5) and (x=1.5, y=29.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Production at Position (x=15.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace at position (x=15.0, y=0.0), with no ingredients to smelt, producing iron plates.\n- Inserters at positions (x=16.5, y=0.5) and (x=17.5, y=0.5), waiting for source items and not connected to the power network.\n- Wooden chests at positions (x=5.5, y=0.5) and (x=18.5, y=0.5), used for storage.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Steam Engine and Boiler Connectivity\n- Ensure that the steam engine and boiler are properly connected to a fluid source and the power network. Verify that all necessary pipes are connected and that there is a continuous path for fluids to flow from the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Power Connectivity\n- Make sure inserters are connected to the power network. Place electric poles within range to supply electricity to the inserters.\n\n### Errors with Boiler Fluid Input\n- Check that the boiler is connected to a source of water. Ensure that the pipes leading from the offshore pump to the boiler are correctly placed and not obstructed.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Input\n- Ensure that the furnace has the necessary ingredients to smelt. Verify that inserters are correctly positioned to deliver materials to the furnace.\n\n### General Connectivity Issues\n- Regularly check the status of all entities to ensure they are connected to their respective networks (fluid, electricity). Use diagnostic tools to identify and resolve connectivity issues promptly."}
