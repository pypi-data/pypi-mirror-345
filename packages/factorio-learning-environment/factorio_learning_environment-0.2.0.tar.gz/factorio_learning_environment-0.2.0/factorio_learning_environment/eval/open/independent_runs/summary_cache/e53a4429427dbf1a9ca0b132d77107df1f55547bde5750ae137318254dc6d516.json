{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) storing extracted iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-14.5, -46.5) transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n\n### Coal Extraction and Processing Facility at Position (41.5, -80.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) extracting coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -80.5) storing extracted coal.\n- Stone Furnace at position (43.0, -82.0) processing materials.\n- Burner Inserter at position (43.5, -80.5) transferring materials to the furnace.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items without available inventory\n- Ensure that the required items are available in your inventory before attempting to insert them into a structure. This will prevent errors such as \"Could not insert: No iron-ore to insert from your inventory.\"\n\n### Errors due to full chests preventing mining\n- Regularly check and empty chests at drop positions to prevent mining drills from stopping due to full storage. This will avoid warnings like \"chest at drop position is full. Empty the chest to continue mining.\"\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
