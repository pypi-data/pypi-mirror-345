{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace (position (0.0, 0.0)) that is currently smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position (-15.0, -50.0)) which is extracting iron ore and has a drop position to a wooden chest.\n\n### Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest (position (-14.5, -48.5)) that is currently storing iron ore.\n\n### Wooden Chest at position (2.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest (position (2.5, 0.5)) that is currently intended for storing iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to type comparisons\n- Ensure that comparisons involving integers and other types (like entities) are correctly typed. For example, avoid comparing an entity (like a Chest) with an integer.\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to place an entity. For instance, the error regarding the Wooden Chest indicates that the agent attempted to place it without having enough wood.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into entities\n- When inserting items into an entity, ensure that the second argument is a valid entity. The error indicates that a NoneType was passed instead of a valid entity.\n\n### Errors when extracting items\n- Make sure to check the inventory of the source entity before attempting to extract items. The warning from the Burner Mining Drill indicates that the chest at the drop position is full, which prevents further mining.\n\n### Common mistakes\n- The agent has repeatedly encountered type errors when checking quantities of items in entities. Review the data types being used in comparisons and ensure they are compatible.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `place_entity`: This function is used to place entities on the map. It has encountered an error when trying to place a Wooden Chest due to insufficient inventory.\n- `insert_item`: This function is used to insert items into entities. It failed when a NoneType was passed instead of a valid entity.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `inserted_ore`: Type - Unknown (previously expected to be an integer but encountered a type error).\n- `extracted_ore`: Type - Unknown (used in the context of item extraction).\n- `new_chest_position`: Type - Position (used for placing the new Wooden Chest).\n- `inventory`: Type - Inventory (stores the current items in the agent's inventory)."}
