{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n###Iron Smelting Area at position(0,0)\nConsists of two furnaces:\n- Stone furnace at position(0,0) - currently working on iron plates\n- Stone furnace at position(2,0) - currently idle but contains iron plates\n\n###Copper Smelting Area at position(4,4) \nConsists of two furnaces:\n- Stone furnace at position(4,4) - currently idle but contains copper plates\n- Stone furnace at position(6,4) - currently idle but contains copper plates\n\n###Power Generation System at position(-2.5,24)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position(-9.5,24.5) - working, producing water\n- Pipe network connecting pump to boiler - currently contains water\n- Boiler at position(-2.5,24) - currently out of fuel\n- Steam engine at position(4.5,24.5) - not working due to no steam input\n- Second pipe network from boiler to engine - currently empty\n- Electric pole network with poles at positions (8.5,2.5), (8.5,14.5), (8.5,18.5), (8.5,6.5), (8.5,10.5), (6.5,24.5)\n\n###Research Lab\n- Lab containing 65 automation science packs\n- Currently researching logistics but inactive due to no power\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Power system errors\n- Keep monitoring boiler fuel levels to prevent power outages\n- Ensure steam connections between boiler and engine are properly maintained\n\n### Resource management errors\n- Check inventory before attempting to insert materials into furnaces\n- Maintain adequate stockpiles of basic resources (coal, iron ore, copper ore)\n\n### Research errors\n- Cannot set research that has prerequisites not yet completed (e.g. Electronics requires Automation)\n- Ensure power system is working for research to progress\n\n### Inventory capacity errors\n- Check furnace inventory capacity before inserting new materials\n- Remove processed materials from furnaces before adding new raw materials\n\n### Crafting errors\n- Cannot craft items that require machine assembly (like iron gear wheels) by hand\n- Use appropriate crafting machines for items that cannot be hand crafted"}
