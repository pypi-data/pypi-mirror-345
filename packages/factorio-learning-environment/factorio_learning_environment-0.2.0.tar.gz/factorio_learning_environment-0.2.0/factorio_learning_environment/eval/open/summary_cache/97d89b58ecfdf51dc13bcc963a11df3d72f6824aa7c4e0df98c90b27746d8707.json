{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron ore mining and smelting structure at position around (17.5, 72.5)\nConsists of the following connected entities:\n- Electric mining drill at position (17.5, 72.5) facing down, powered but output blocked due to furnace belt blockage.\n- Stone furnace at position (18.0, 75.0), fueled with coal and working, though output inventory is often full.\n- Three wooden chests at positions (19.5, 75.5), (21.5, 75.5), and (21.5, 77.5), serving as staged storage for iron plates.\n- Burner inserters at positions (20.5, 75.5) and (20.5, 77.5), both fueled and moving iron plates between furnace and chests.\n- Small electric pole at (15.5, 75.5) connected to power network.\nThis structure enables iron ore extraction, smelting, and storage with improved fuel supply to inserters, though output blockage at furnace belt persists.\n\n### Steam power generation structure at position around (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, -0.5) extracting water.\n- Boiler at position (-5.0, 2.5), fueled with coal and working.\n- Steam engine at position (0.5, 6.5), connected by pipes to boiler and generating power.\n- Small electric poles at (-4.5, -0.5), (0.5, 3.5), and (15.5, 75.5) connected to the power network.\nThis structure reliably generates electricity for the factory.\n\n### Iron gear wheel assembly structure at position around (25.5, 80.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine 2 at (25.5, 80.5), now connected to power network via a newly placed small electric pole at (25.5, 77.5).\n- Input wooden chest at (21.5, 77.5) feeding iron plates into assembly area.\n- Output wooden chest at (25.5, 82.5), replaced after removal to free space.\n- Output burner inserter at (25.5, 83.5), fueled and operational, moving assembled items into output chest.\n- Input burner inserter at (20.5, 77.5) feeding iron plates into the assembly area.\nDespite power connection and inserter fuel improvements, assembling machine remains idle due to lack of iron plates in its input inventory.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity placement conflicts due to occupied tiles\n- Repeated failures to place small electric poles near steam engine and furnace due to existing poles occupying tiles.\n- Attempt to place small electric pole next to steam engine at (0.5, 6.5) failed because a pole already exists at (0.5, 3.5).\n- To avoid these errors, always verify tile occupancy before placement.\n- Increase spacing, change placement direction, or adjust reference positions to find free tiles.\n\n### Inserter fuel and inventory management\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5), (20.5, 77.5), and (25.5, 83.5) are now consistently fueled, preventing stoppages.\n- Previously, inserters ran out of fuel or had full inventories blocking coal insertion.\n- Continue monitoring inserter fuel levels and inventories to maintain uninterrupted operation.\n\n### Assembly operation and resource supply issues\n- Assembling machine 2 at (25.5, 80.5) remains without input iron plates, causing ITEM_INGREDIENT_SHORTAGE and preventing crafting.\n- Input and output inventories of assembling machine are empty despite available iron plates in nearby chests.\n- Ensure iron plates are properly routed from storage chests to assembling machine input.\n- Verify inserters feeding the assembling machine are correctly positioned and powered.\n\n### Output blockage and power connectivity warnings\n- Mining drill at (17.5, 72.5) still reports \"furnace belt at drop position is blocked,\" limiting output flow.\n- Furnace output inventories frequently full, indicating downstream storage or belt congestion.\n- Assembling machine now connected to power network, resolving previous power issues.\n- Maintain clear output belts and chests to prevent blocking.\n- Confirm all machines remain connected to power network for operation.\n\nNAMESPACE\nNo user-defined functions have been defined by the agent."}
