{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-16.0, -51.0) with coal fuel, currently working, but output is blocked by an item on the ground. It is extracting iron ore from a resource patch with 40,000 units of iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-14.0, -49.0) with coal fuel, currently has no ingredients to smelt. It is positioned to receive iron ore from the Burner Mining Drill.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied or invalid locations\n- Ensure the desired location for placing entities like Wooden Chests, Stone Furnaces, Burner Inserters, and Transport Belts is unoccupied and valid before attempting placement.\n\n### Errors in retrieving entities from specific positions\n- Verify the existence of entities at specific positions before attempting to get them. This will prevent errors related to missing entities, such as Stone Furnaces.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient inventory items\n- Check your inventory to ensure you have the required items, such as coal, before attempting to insert them into other entities.\n\n### Errors related to blocked outputs\n- Ensure that there is a clear path or sink entity for outputs from machines like Burner Mining Drills to avoid blockage warnings.\n\n### Errors due to missing ingredients in production entities\n- Ensure that production entities like Stone Furnaces have the necessary ingredients to process, preventing them from having a \"no ingredients to smelt\" status."}
