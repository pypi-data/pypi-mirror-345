{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-29.5, 30.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position -29.5, 30.5), boiler (position -24.5, -50.0), and offshore pump (position -10.5, 25.5). The steam engine is currently not connected to the power network and is not receiving power.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(-18.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position -18.0, -49.0) and a furnace (position -18.0, -49.0)\n\n### Copper cable factory at position(-24.5, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine (position -24.5, -50.0) and inserter that puts into the assembling machine\n- Beltgroup that connects the furnace at position -18.0, -49.0 to the assembling machine at position -24.5, -50.0\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to electricity connection\n- Ensure that the steam engine is connected to a power network by placing electric poles nearby and ensuring they are powered.\n- Check the status of electric poles to confirm they are operational and providing voltage.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it.\n\n### Errors related to fluid connections\n- Verify that the boiler has a source of water and that it is properly connected to the offshore pump to avoid it being out of fuel."}
