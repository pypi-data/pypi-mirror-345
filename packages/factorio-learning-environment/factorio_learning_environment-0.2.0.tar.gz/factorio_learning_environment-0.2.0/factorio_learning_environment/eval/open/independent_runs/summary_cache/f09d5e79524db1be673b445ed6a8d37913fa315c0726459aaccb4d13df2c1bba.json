{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at position (-15.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -49.0) used for smelting iron ore into iron plates. Current status: Working. Fuel: 4 units of coal, Source: 24 units of iron ore, Result: 66 iron plates.\n\n### Coal Mining and Transport System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (42.0, -83.0) with coal as fuel, currently working. It has a warning for output being blocked due to no sink entity.\n- Burner Inserter at position (42.5, -81.5) with coal as fuel, currently waiting for source items. It has a warning that the chest is full.\n- Transport Belts connecting positions (42.5, -82.5) to (44.5, -82.5) in the right direction and (43.5, -81.5) to (43.5, -79.5) in the down direction. Another belt connects (43.5, -80.5) to (42.5, -79.5) in the left direction.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Ensure that the tile is unoccupied before attempting to place an entity. This includes checking for existing entities or items on the ground.\n\n### Errors due to blocked output from mining drills\n- Ensure there is a sink entity such as a chest or belt to accept the output from mining drills to prevent blockage.\n\n### Errors due to full chests\n- Regularly monitor and clear chests to ensure they have space for incoming items, preventing inserters from stalling."}
