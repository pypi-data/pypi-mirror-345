{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Iron Ore Mine at position (16.0, 71.0)\nConsists of a burner mining drill at position (16.0, 71.0), a wooden chest at position (15.5, 69.5), a burner inserter at position (14.5, 69.5), another burner inserter at position (16.5, 69.5), a stone furnace at position (16.0, 65.0), and a burner inserter at position (16.5, 63.5) that inputs into the furnace.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n### Errors due to undefined variables\n- Ensure that variables are defined before using them. For example, 'belt', 'entity', and 'furnace' are not defined, causing NameError. Check the correct names of entities and variables before using them.\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied positions\n- Ensure that the target position is not occupied by another entity before attempting to place an entity.\n\n### Errors when getting non-existent entities\n- Ensure that the entity exists at the specified position before attempting to get it.\n\n### Errors when connecting entities with transport belts\n- Transport belts cannot be connected directly from a Prototype.WoodenChest object as a source or target. You need to add an inserter that takes items from Prototype.WoodenChest and use the inserter as a source entity, or add an inserter that inputs items into Prototype.WoodenChest and use the inserter as the target entity.\n\n### Errors when the target position is too far away\n- Ensure that you are close enough to the target position before attempting to place an entity. The maximum distance allowed is 10 units.\n\n### Errors when passing incorrect argument types\n- Ensure that the correct argument types are passed to functions. For example, 'reference_position' must be a Position object.\n\n## NAMESPACE\nNo utility functions have been defined by the agent.\n\nImportant variables:\n- `drill`: BurnerMiningDrill entity at position (16.0, 71.0)\n- `chest`: WoodenChest entity at position (15.5, 69.5)\n- `inserter`: BurnerInserter entity at position (14.5, 69.5)\n- `furnace`: StoneFurnace entity at position (16.0, 65.0)\n- `inserter`: BurnerInserter entity at position (16.5, 63.5)\n- `chest_inserter`: BurnerInserter entity at position (16.5, 69.5)"}
