{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Operation (Unchanged)\n- **Electric mining drills** at positions (15.5, 70.5), (18.5, 70.5), and (21.5, 70.5) extracting iron ore.\n- **Stone furnaces** at positions (16.0, 73.0), (19.0, 73.0), and (22.0, 73.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Output system** consisting of wooden chests at positions (16.5, 75.5), (19.5, 75.5), and (22.5, 75.5) with inserters at positions (16.5, 74.5), (19.5, 74.5), and (22.5, 74.5) to transfer smelted plates into chests.\n\n#### Power Generation Setup (Updated)\n- **Offshore pump** at position (-9.5, -0.5) facing RIGHT, connected to a **boiler** at (-6.0, -0.5) via pipes.\n- **Boiler** at (-6.0, -0.5) with fuel but not connected to a steam engine (status: `NOT_CONNECTED`).\n- **Steam engine** at (-1.5, 5.5) not connected to the boiler.\n- **Small electric poles** placed but not forming a complete power network.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Fluid Connection Errors\n- **Incorrect fluid connection between offshore pump and boiler**: The pump must face the boiler's input connection point and be placed adjacent to it. Verify alignment and ensure no obstacles block the connection.\n- **Boiler not receiving water**: Check pipe connections between the pump and boiler. Pipes must form a continuous path with no gaps or misalignments.\n- **Steam engine not receiving steam**: Ensure the boiler is correctly connected to the steam engine with pipes and that the boiler is fueled and operational.\n\n#### Placement and Alignment Errors\n- **Misaligned entity placement**: Ensure entities like offshore pumps and boilers are correctly aligned to allow fluid transfer. The connection points must face each other.\n- **Blocked connection points**: Avoid placing entities where obstacles (e.g., terrain, other entities) block fluid or power connections.\n- **Steam engine placement issues**: Avoid placing steam engines on unplaceable terrain (e.g., water). Check the target location before placement.\n\n#### Power Connection Issues\n- **Electric mining drills and inserters not receiving power**: Ensure all electric entities are within the coverage area of electric poles and that the power network is properly connected and operational.\n\n#### General Tips\n- **Check entity statuses**: Always verify the status of entities (e.g., `EntityStatus.NOT_CONNECTED`, `EntityStatus.NO_POWER`) to diagnose issues.\n- **Fuel and ingredients**: Ensure boilers have fuel and furnaces have ingredients to operate.\n- **Power network integrity**: Verify that all electric poles are connected and form a continuous network to supply power to all entities.\n- **Debugging fluid systems**: Use debug tools to check pipe connections and fluid flow if issues persist. Ensure pipes are correctly placed and aligned.\n\n#### New Errors from Recent Steps\n- **PipeGroup object has no attribute 'fluid'**: When debugging, avoid accessing undefined attributes. Use `pipe.fluid_box` or `pipe.flow_rate` instead.\n- **Boiler placement conflicts**: Ensure no existing entities block boiler placement. Clear the target area before attempting to place."}
