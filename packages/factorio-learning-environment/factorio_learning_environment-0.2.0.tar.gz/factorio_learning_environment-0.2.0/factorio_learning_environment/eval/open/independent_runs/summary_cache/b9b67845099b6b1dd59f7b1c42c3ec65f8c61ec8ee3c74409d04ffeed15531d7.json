{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-16.0, -51.0) with a drop position at (-16.5, -52.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0)\n\nThis setup is responsible for extracting iron ore and smelting it into iron plates. The Burner Mining Drill extracts iron ore and places it into the Stone Furnace for smelting.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- **Wooden Chest Placement**: Ensure that the location where you intend to place a Wooden Chest is not occupied by another entity or obstructed.\n- **Burner Inserter Placement**: Verify that the desired location for placing a Burner Inserter is clear and suitable for placement.\n- **Transport Belt Placement**: Check that the intended placement area for a Transport Belt is free from obstructions and other entities.\n\n### Furnace Production Issues\n- **Iron Plate Production**: Ensure that the Stone Furnace has the necessary ingredients (iron ore) and fuel to produce iron plates. Regularly check the furnace setup to confirm it is correctly configured and supplied.\n\n### Output Blockage in Mining Drill\n- **Output Blocked by Item on the Ground**: Ensure that there is a sink entity, such as a chest or furnace, to accept the output from the Burner Mining Drill. Clear any items blocking the drill's output position to maintain continuous operation."}
