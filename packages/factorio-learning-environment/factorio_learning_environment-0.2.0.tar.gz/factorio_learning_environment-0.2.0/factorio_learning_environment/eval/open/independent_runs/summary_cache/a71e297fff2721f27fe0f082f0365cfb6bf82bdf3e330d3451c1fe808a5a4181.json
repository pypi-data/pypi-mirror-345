{"content": "# FACTORIO AGENT REPORT\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System (x=-9.5, y=-0.5 to x=0.5, y=6.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump at x=-9.5, y=-0.5 (extracting water)\n- Boiler at x=-5.0, y=2.5 (converting water to steam)\n- Steam Engine at x=0.5, y=6.5 (generating electricity)\n- Coal storage chest at x=-7.5, y=5.5 (containing 100 coal)\n- Coal feeding inserter (burner-inserter) at x=-7.5, y=4.5 (automatically feeding coal to boiler)\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pump to boiler and boiler to steam engine\n\n### Crude Oil Production System (x=17.5, y=40.5 to x=58.5, y=56.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Pumpjack at x=17.5, y=40.5 (extracting crude oil from a patch of size 299830)\n- Storage Tank 1 at x=23.5, y=43.5 (storing crude oil)\n- Storage Tank 2 at x=35.5, y=47.5 (storing crude oil)\n- Storage Tank 3 at x=47.5, y=51.5 (storing crude oil)\n- Storage Tank 4 at x=58.5, y=56.5 (storing crude oil)\n- Pipe network connecting the pumpjack to all storage tanks\n- Small electric poles connecting power from the steam engine to the pumpjack\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities on unsuitable terrain\n- Ensure the target location is suitable for the entity you're trying to place (e.g., pumpjacks can't be placed on water or where other entities already exist)\n- Check the terrain before attempting to place entities\n\n### Errors with function arguments\n- When using the `nearest()` function, make sure to provide the correct number of arguments\n- The error suggests that `nearest()` takes 2 positional arguments but 3 were given\n\n### Errors with inserter placement and orientation\n- Pay attention to the orientation of inserters to ensure they can pick up from the source and drop at the target\n- Multiple attempts were needed to correctly position the coal inserter for the boiler\n\n### Errors with fluid level calculations\n- There seems to be a discrepancy between the reported fluid levels in storage tanks and the calculated total\n- When calculating total fluid storage, ensure you're correctly accessing and summing the fluid amounts\n\n## NAMESPACE\nNo custom functions have been defined by the agent yet."}
