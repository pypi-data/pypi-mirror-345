{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-8.5, 24.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position (-8.5, 24.5)\n- Boiler at position (-5.5, 25.0)\n- Steam engine at position (-12.5, 24.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing pipes and underground pipes\n- Ensure the target location for placing pipes and underground pipes is not obstructed by other entities or terrain features. Consider clearing obstructions or choosing alternate paths.\n\n### Errors when placing steam engines\n- Verify that the steam engine's footprint does not overlap with water or other entities. Adjust the position to ensure a clear area for placement.\n\n### Errors when establishing power networks\n- Ensure that electric poles are placed within the correct range and not obstructed by other entities. Consider moving closer to the intended placement area if necessary.\n\n### Errors with entity connection and status\n- Ensure all components of the electricity generator (offshore pump, boiler, steam engine) are properly connected. Check for missing connections or misplaced components.\n\n### Errors when supplying ingredients to furnaces\n- Verify that the correct entity type is being referenced when supplying ingredients. Ensure that the target entity exists and is accessible.\n\n### Errors with data type and attribute usage\n- Ensure that data types used in calculations or assignments are appropriate (e.g., converting to integers). Double-check attribute names and ensure they exist in the context being used.\n\n### Errors with distance when placing entities\n- Move closer to the target position when placing entities to ensure they are within the allowable placement range.\n\n### Errors with entity status\n- Check the status of entities like boilers and steam engines to ensure they are connected and operational. Address any \"NOT_CONNECTED\" statuses by verifying connections and placements."}
