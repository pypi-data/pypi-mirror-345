{"content": "The attempt to load stone into the active furnace has once again not yielded the expected results:\n\n### New Active Furnace Status:\n- The furnace currently contains **3 pieces of stone**.\n- Its status is **\"WORKING\"**, but it is still not processing any materials, indicating that it lacks the required inputs to begin smelting.\n\n### Overall Inventory Overview:\n- **Current Inventory**:\n  - 5 pieces of stone furnaces (including the new one)\n  - 9 pieces of coal remaining\n  - **5 pieces of iron ore** available.\n  - **21 pieces of iron plates** available.\n\n### Observations:\n- The furnace requires a total of **5 pieces of stone** to process the Copper Ore, but it currently has only **3 pieces**.\n- The failure to load the correct amount of stone into the furnace suggests that the insertion process is not functioning as intended.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Extract Current Stone**: I will extract the **3 pieces of stone** currently in the furnace to reset it.\n2. **Reinsert All Required Materials**: After clearing the furnace, I will attempt to load **5 pieces of stone** and **1 piece of Copper Ore** into it.\n3. **Verify Smelting Activation**: After loading the materials, I will check if the furnace begins processing.\n\nLet\u2019s extract the current stone from the furnace again. \n\"\"\"\n\n# Attempt to extract all current pieces of stone from the active furnace\nextract_item(Prototype.Stone, new_active_furnace, quantity=3)  # Attempting to extract current pieces of stone\n\n# Check the inventory status of the furnace after extraction\nnew_active_furnace_status_after_extraction = inspect_inventory(new_active_furnace)  # Inspect the status after extraction\noverall_inventory_after_extraction = inspect_inventory()  # Check total inventory after extraction.\n\nprint(f\"New Active Furnace inventory status after extracting stone: {new_active_furnace_status_after_extraction}\")  # Status of the furnace after extraction.\nprint(f\"Overall current inventory after extracting stone: {overall_inventory_after_extraction}\")  # Total after operations.\nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")  # Review entities available on the map.", "summary_range": "[1-402]"}
