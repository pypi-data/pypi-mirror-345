The error \"Could not get Prototype.Lab at position x=0.0 y=0.0\" indicates that there is no lab at the specified position. Double-check the coordinates and ensure the lab exists before calling the retrieval function.\n\n### Errors When Using Extracting but Being Too Far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors When Placing into a Tile Which is Occupied by Another Entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
