{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (-1.5, 24.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe Group connecting the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine with various pipe segments, including positions like (-9.5, 23.5), (-7.5, 23.5), and (0.5, 22.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (9.0, -64.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0) with coal as fuel and iron-plate production.\n- Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0) with coal as fuel, currently with no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Storage and Inserter System\nConsists of:\n- Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5) and another at Position (6.5, -59.5).\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) connected to a power source at Position (7.5, -60.5), waiting for source items.\n\n### Laboratory Setup\nConsists of:\n- Lab with input of automation-science-pack at Position (not specified), currently with no research in progress.\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of:\n- Small Electric Poles at various positions, including (0.5, 21.5), (-0.5, 27.5), and (7.5, -60.5), forming an electricity network with a voltage of 13227.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Pipe Connection\n- Ensure that the pipe connections are correctly aligned and that there are no missing segments between connection points. Check the starting and ending positions of pipes to ensure they are correctly placed.\n\n### Errors in Inventory Management\n- Verify that you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities like furnaces. Keep track of your inventory levels to avoid such errors.\n\n### Errors in Research Initiation\n- Make sure that the lab is correctly set up with the required science packs and that the research is selected before attempting to start research.\n\n### Errors in Electric Pole Connection\n- Ensure that electric poles are within range to connect to each other and to the entities they are supposed to power. Check the positions and ensure there are no gaps in the electric network."}
