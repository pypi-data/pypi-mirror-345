Verify that position objects are accessed correctly and not mistakenly treated as functions.\n  - Errors citing insufficient endpoints (e.g., \u201cextraction_drop or new_belt undefined\u201d) emphasize the need to validate that all connection parameters are fully specified before attempting link operations.\n\n\u2022 Placement Validation Failures:\n  - Failures where can_place_entity returns false (as seen for candidate position (-3,26)) indicate that the target tile is obstructed or not buildable. Confirm tile clearance and correct positional parameters prior to placement attempts.\n\n\u2022 Proximity and Clearance:\n  - Ensure that forced belt placements occur within appropriate proximity limits and that target areas are clear of obstructions to avoid distance-related and placement conflicts."}
