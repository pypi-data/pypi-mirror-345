{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, -60.0) with a drop position at (4.5, -58.5). It is currently working but has a warning that the chest at the drop position is full.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (5.5, -60.5), (7.5, -60.5), (6.5, -60.5), (9.5, -60.5), (8.5, -60.5), and (4.5, -58.5). The chest at (4.5, -58.5) contains iron ore.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (-15.0, -48.0), (-13.0, -48.0), and (-11.0, -48.0). The furnaces at (-15.0, -48.0) and (-13.0, -48.0) are working, while the furnace at (-11.0, -48.0) has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Full Inventory\n- Ensure that the chest at the drop position of the burner mining drill is emptied regularly to prevent mining from halting due to a full chest.\n\n### Errors When Inserting Items\n- Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. For instance, ensure you have coal available before trying to insert it into a furnace or mining drill.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `insert_item`: This function attempts to insert a specified quantity of an item into a target entity. A failure mode was observed when trying to insert coal into a furnace without having coal in the inventory, resulting in an exception.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `inventory`: A dictionary representing the current inventory, with keys as item names and values as quantities. Current state: `{'wooden-chest': 3, 'coal': 13, 'iron-plate': 4790, 'iron-gear-wheel': 4}`."}
