{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, -60.0) with a drop position at (4.5, -58.5). This drill is currently working but has a warning indicating that the chest at the drop position is full.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions:\n  - (5.5, -60.5)\n  - (7.5, -60.5)\n  - (6.5, -60.5)\n  - (9.5, -60.5)\n  - (8.5, -60.5)\n  - (4.5, -58.5) containing iron ore.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions:\n  - (-15.0, -48.0)\n  - (-13.0, -48.0)\n  - (-11.0, -48.0)\n  These furnaces are used for smelting iron ore into iron plates. They have been intermittently working due to a lack of ingredients.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Chest Full Warning\n- Ensure to regularly empty the chest at position (4.5, -58.5) to prevent the burner mining drill from halting operations due to a full chest.\n\n### No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Ensure that furnaces have a consistent supply of iron ore to maintain continuous production. Regularly check and replenish the iron ore in the furnaces at positions (-15.0, -48.0), (-13.0, -48.0), and (-11.0, -48.0).\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- **Utility Functions**: None defined.\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `wooden-chest`: int = 3\n  - `iron-plate`: int = 4390\n  - `iron-gear-wheel`: int = 4\n\nNo utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided steps."}
