{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-9.5, 24.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5): Status - WORKING\n- Boiler at position (-2.5, 24.0): Status - NO_FUEL\n- Steam Engine at position (-5.5, 19.5): Status - NOT_CONNECTED\n- Pipe-group at position (-5.5, 16.5): Status - EMPTY\n- Pipe-group at position (-8.5, 23.5): Status - FULL_OUTPUT\n- Electricity-group at position (-5.4, 20.0): Status - NOT_PLUGGED_IN_ELECTRIC_NETWORK\n\n### Stone Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Status: NO_INGREDIENTS\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure that the correct type of pipe (either 'Pipe' or 'UndergroundPipe') is used to connect the Offshore Pump to the Boiler and the Boiler to the Steam Engine. Verify the alignment and connectivity of pipes to avoid connection failures.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Fuel\n- Regularly check the fuel levels in the Boiler to ensure it is operational. Make sure to have a sufficient supply of coal in the inventory to insert into the Boiler.\n\n### Errors in Placing Small Electric Poles\n- Ensure that Small Electric Poles are available in the inventory before attempting to place them. Craft additional poles if necessary to maintain the electricity network.\n\n### Errors Due to Inventory Shortages\n- Regularly monitor inventory levels to ensure that necessary items like coal and small electric poles are available for operations. Harvest or craft items as needed to avoid shortages.\n\n### Errors in Electric Network Connectivity\n- Verify that all components of the electricity network are properly connected and plugged in. Ensure that electric poles are placed correctly to maintain connectivity across the network."}
