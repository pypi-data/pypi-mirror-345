{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production at (-18.0, -53.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-18.0, -53.0) with drop position (-17.5, -51.5)\n- Stone furnace at (-17.0, -51.0) containing 4 coal and 20 iron plates\nCurrently inactive due to lack of fuel in mining drill\n\n### Copper Plate Production at (-21.0, -73.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-21.0, -73.0) with drop position (-20.5, -71.5)\n- Stone furnace at (-20.0, -71.0) containing 2 coal and 14 copper plates\nCurrently inactive due to lack of fuel in mining drill\n\n### Smelting Area near Origin\nGroup of furnaces each containing 23 coal:\n- Stone furnace at (0.0, 0.0)\n- Stone furnace at (2.0, 0.0)\n- Stone furnace at (2.0, 4.0)\n- Stone furnace at (4.0, 4.0)\nAll furnaces have fuel but no ingredients to smelt\n\n### Research Facility\n- Lab containing 10 automation science packs\nCurrently not functioning due to lack of power\n\n### Power Generation System (Updated Configuration)\nCurrent setup consists of:\n- Boiler at (-14.5, 19.0) containing 33 coal\n- Steam engine at (-5.5, 19.5)\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Electric pole at (-1.5, 19.5)\n- Multiple pipe groups connecting components\nSystem not functioning due to incomplete fluid connections between components\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Conflicts\n- Check target location for existing entities before placement\n- Ensure sufficient clear space around placement area\n- Remove blocking entities before attempting new placements\n\n### Pipe System Management\n- Remove ALL pipe groups before starting new connections\n- Create direct, minimal connections between components\n- Avoid creating multiple parallel or redundant pipe connections\n- Verify connection points are clear and accessible before placing pipes\n- Ensure proper spacing between steam engine and boiler for pipe connections\n\n### Power System Construction\n- Place power components in proper sequence: offshore pump \u2192 boiler \u2192 steam engine\n- Steam engine must be placed with correct orientation (LEFT/RIGHT) relative to boiler\n- Create steam connections before placing steam engine\n- Maintain proper spacing between components for fluid connections\n- Ensure steam engine and boiler connection points align properly\n- Clear all existing entities from the target location before placing steam engine\n\n### Resource Management\n- Mining drills and furnaces need constant fuel supply to operate\n- Maintain fuel levels in all burner devices to prevent operation interruption\n\n### Power Distribution\n- Electric poles must be properly connected to form a complete power network\n- Ensure power consumers (like labs) are within range of electric poles\n\n### Fluid System Construction\n- Create single direct water connection first\n- Verify water flow before proceeding with steam connections\n- Keep pipe paths short and direct\n- Ensure all fluid-carrying entities are properly connected in sequence\n- Remove all existing pipe groups before attempting new fluid connections\n- Verify fluid system status after completing connections\n\n### Entity Pickup Errors\n- Verify entity exists at target location before attempting pickup\n- Double check entity type matches what you're trying to pick up\n- Ensure you have the correct coordinates for entity pickup"}
