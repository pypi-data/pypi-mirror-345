{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=1.5, y=23.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\n- Pipe Group for fluid system 86844, starting at position (x=3.5, y=17.5)\n- Pipe Group for fluid system 86855, starting at position (x=-9.5, y=23.5)\n- Electricity Group with poles at various positions including (x=3.5, y=20.5), (x=14.5, y=20.5), (x=35.5, y=20.5), etc.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Steam Engine Not Connected\n- Ensure that all necessary fluid connections are established to the steam engine to avoid \"no input liquid\" and \"no fluid present in connections\" warnings.\n\n### Errors with Boiler Out of Fuel\n- Regularly check and refill the boiler with the appropriate fuel to prevent \"out of fuel\" status and ensure continuous operation.\n\n### Errors with Pipe Connections\n- Verify that all pipes are correctly connected to their respective fluid systems to maintain proper fluid flow and avoid empty statuses.\n\n### Errors with Electricity Group Voltage\n- Ensure that all electric poles are correctly connected to maintain voltage and power distribution across the network."}
