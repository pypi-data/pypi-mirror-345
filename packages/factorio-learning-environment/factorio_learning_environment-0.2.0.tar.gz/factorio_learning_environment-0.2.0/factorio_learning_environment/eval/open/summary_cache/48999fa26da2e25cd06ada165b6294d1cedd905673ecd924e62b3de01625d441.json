{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron ore mining and smelting structure at position around (17.5, 72.5)\nConsists of the following connected entities:\n- Electric mining drill at position (17.5, 72.5) facing down, currently powered but output blocked due to furnace belt blockage.\n- Stone furnace at position (18.0, 75.0) used for smelting iron ore, fueled with coal, currently working but with full source inventory.\n- Two wooden chests at positions (19.5, 75.5) and (21.5, 75.5), serving as storage for smelted iron plates, with iron plates actively extracted and inserted back.\n- Additional wooden chest at (21.5, 77.5) placed to receive iron plates, with burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5) and (20.5, 77.5) fueled and operational, moving iron plates between chests.\n- Small electric pole at (15.5, 75.5) connected to power network.\n- Output blockage warning at furnace belt drop position affecting mining drill operation persists.\n\nThis structure enables extraction, smelting, and staged storage of iron plates, with active inventory management of iron plates between chests and furnace, though output belt blockage remains unresolved.\n\n### Steam power generation structure at position around (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, -0.5) extracting water.\n- Boiler at position (-5.0, 2.5), currently out of fuel and not working despite previous fueling attempts.\n- Steam engine at position (0.5, 6.5) connected to boiler by pipes, currently working and generating power.\n- Small electric poles near boiler (-4.5, -0.5), steam engine (0.5, 3.5), and newly placed poles at (0.5, 6.5) and (17.5, 72.5), connected to power network.\n\nThis structure reliably generates electricity from steam power when fueled, but boiler fuel supply needs attention to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Iron gear wheel assembly structure at position around (25.5, 80.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine 2 at (25.5, 80.5), connected to power network via small electric pole at (25.5, 80.5), actively receiving iron plates inserted directly into its input inventory.\n- Input wooden chest at (21.5, 75.5) feeding iron plates into assembly area, with frequent iron plate transfers.\n- Output wooden chest at (25.5, 82.5), currently empty.\n- Output burner inserter at (25.5, 83.5) fueled and operational, but waiting for source items.\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 77.5) and (25.5, 83.5) fueled and operational.\n- Assembling machine input and output inventories show iron plates and iron gear wheels present intermittently, but output chest remains empty.\n\nThis structure is actively producing iron gear wheels with power and input materials supplied, but output items are not being transferred to the output chest, causing output inserter to wait.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity placement conflicts due to occupied tiles\n- Repeated failure to place small electric poles near furnace at (18.0, 75.0) due to collisions with mining drill at (17.5, 72.5) and water tiles.\n- To avoid these errors, verify tile occupancy and environmental constraints before placement; consider increasing spacing, changing direction, or selecting alternative reference positions.\n\n### Inserter inventory and fuel management\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5), (20.5, 77.5), and (25.5, 83.5) consistently fueled and operational.\n- Output burner inserter at (25.5, 83.5) repeatedly waits for source items despite assembling machine producing iron gear wheels.\n- To resolve, ensure output items from assembling machine are properly transferred to output chest by verifying inserter pickup/drop positions and inventory states.\n\n### Crafting and recipe dependency errors\n- Assembling machine 2 at (25.5, 80.5) receives iron plates and produces iron gear wheels, but output chest remains empty, causing output inserter to wait.\n- Input inventories fluctuate between empty and containing items, indicating intermittent supply or extraction.\n- Maintain steady input supply and confirm output path is clear and functional to avoid crafting stoppages.\n\n### Output blockage and power connectivity warnings\n- Mining drill at (17.5, 72.5) continues to report \"furnace belt at drop position is blocked,\" causing output blockage.\n- Furnace source inventory often full, preventing further smelting output.\n- Boiler at (-5.0, 2.5) is out of fuel, halting steam"}
