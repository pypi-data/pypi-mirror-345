{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll generate a comprehensive report:\n\n# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Transport System (Around position x=41-45, y=-80 to -83)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (x=41.0, y=-82.0) mining coal\n- Iron chest (x=41.5, y=-83.5) collecting mined coal\n- Wooden chest (x=41.5, y=-80.5) for coal storage\n- Transport belt (x=42.5, y=-80.5) facing RIGHT\n- Burner inserter (x=43.5, y=-80.5) facing RIGHT\n- Stone furnace (x=45.0, y=-81.0)\n\n### Secondary Furnace System (Around position x=47-50, y=-80 to -81)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace (x=47.0, y=-81.0)\n- Wooden chest (x=49.5, y=-80.5) containing iron plates\n\n### Transport Belt Network\n- Main belt group running from (x=42.5, y=-68.5) to (x=42.5, y=-77.5)\n- Additional belt at (x=42.5, y=-80.5) facing RIGHT\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Conflicts\n- Before placing inserters or other entities, verify the target position is clear of other objects\n- Common error pattern: Attempting to place burner-inserters where other entities already exist\n- Solution: Check entity positions and ensure adequate spacing between components\n\n### Belt Connection Issues\n- Cannot connect belts directly to chests\n- Solution: Must use inserters as intermediaries between chests and belts\n\n### Entity Positioning\n- Ensure proper spacing between components in automated systems\n- When building transport systems, plan the layout to avoid overlapping entities\n\n# NAMESPACE\n\n### Important Variables:\n- chest_inserter: BurnerInserter\n- furnace_inserter: BurnerInserter\n- belts: BeltGroup\n\n### System Status Variables:\n- EntityStatus.WORKING: Indicates normal operation\n- EntityStatus.WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS: Inserter waiting for items\n- EntityStatus.NO_INGREDIENTS: Furnace lacking materials\n- EntityStatus.NORMAL: Default operational state\n- EntityStatus.EMPTY: Belt system without items\n\n### Entity Properties:\n- position: Position(x: float, y: float)\n- direction: Direction enum\n- inventory: Inventory(Dict[str, int])\n- status: EntityStatus\n- energy: float\n- fuel: Inventory"}
