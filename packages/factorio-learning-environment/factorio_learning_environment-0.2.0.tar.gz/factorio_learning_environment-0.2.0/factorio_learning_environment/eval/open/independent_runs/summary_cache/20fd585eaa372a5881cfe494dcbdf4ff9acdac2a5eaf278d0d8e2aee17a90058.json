{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0): Extracts iron ore and transfers it to a nearby chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5): Stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-15.5, y=-48.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace. \n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates but currently not receiving iron ore due to misalignment issues.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Alignment Errors\n- Ensure that the inserter's pickup position aligns correctly with the chest. The pickup position should match the chest's position to avoid assertion errors. Double-check the alignment before placing the inserter.\n\n### Inserter Placement and Collision Errors\n- When placing an inserter, ensure there is no collision with existing entities. If an error occurs, consider adjusting the spacing, changing the direction, or selecting a different reference position to avoid placement issues.\n\n### Fuel Management Errors\n- Ensure that there is sufficient coal in the inventory before attempting to refuel entities. Keep track of coal levels to prevent running out during critical operations.\n\n### Furnace Input Errors\n- Verify that the inserter setup is correct to ensure the furnace receives the necessary iron ore. Regularly check the inserter's alignment and operation status to ensure smooth transfer of materials."}
