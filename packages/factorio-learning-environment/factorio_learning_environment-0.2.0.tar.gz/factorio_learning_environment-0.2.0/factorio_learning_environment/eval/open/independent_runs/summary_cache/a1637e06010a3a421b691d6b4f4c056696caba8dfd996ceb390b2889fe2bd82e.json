{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-14.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) fueled by coal, currently working with iron ore as input.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -47.5) with coal fuel, waiting for source items, connected to the stone furnace.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-13.5, -46.5) storing iron plates.\n- Transport Belts connecting various entities for item movement.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage Facility at Position (-11.5, -44.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Iron Chest at position (-11.5, -44.5) storing iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-11.5, -45.5) with coal fuel, waiting for space in destination, connected to the iron chest.\n- Transport Belts facilitating item movement to and from the iron chest.\n\n### Coal and Ore Transport System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Multiple Burner Inserters at positions (-13.5, -47.5), (-14.5, -45.5), (-9.5, -44.5), and (-14.5, -43.5) with coal fuel, waiting for source items.\n- BeltGroups and individual Belts connecting various positions to facilitate the movement of coal and ores to the furnaces.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source items are available for the inserters to pick up. Check that the supply chain is not interrupted and that the input resources are adequately stocked.\n\n### Inserters Waiting for Space in Destination\n- Verify that the destination has enough space to accommodate the items being transferred by the inserters. Consider adding additional storage or managing the output more effectively.\n\n### Errors During Optimization: No Iron-Ore to Insert\n- Ensure that there is sufficient iron ore in the inventory before attempting to insert it into the furnace. Regularly check and replenish the ore supply to avoid production halts."}
