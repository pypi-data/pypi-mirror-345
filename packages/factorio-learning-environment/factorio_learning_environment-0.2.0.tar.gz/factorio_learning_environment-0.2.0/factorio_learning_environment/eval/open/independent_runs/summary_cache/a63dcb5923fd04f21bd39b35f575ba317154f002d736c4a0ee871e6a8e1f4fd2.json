{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-46.5, -119.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (-40.5, -113.5)\n- Connected by PipeGroup (positions ranging from -48.5, -122.5 to -40.5, -116.5)\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-15.0, -76.0) with a Wooden Chest at Position (-15.5, -77.5)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-19.0, -73.0)\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0) with an Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) and a Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5)\n- Connected by Small Electric Poles (positions ranging from 5.5, -60.5 to 7.5, -60.5)\n\n### Lab Facility\nConsists of:\n- Lab with input of Automation Science Pack at Position (6.5, -59.5)\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- Multiple PipeGroups with various statuses and fluid systems, primarily empty, spanning across different positions.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Research Progress Retrieval\n- Ensure that the research progress function is correctly implemented and the research is active before calling `get_research_progress()`.\n\n### Errors in Item Insertion Due to Inventory Shortage\n- Verify the availability of items in the inventory before attempting to insert them into entities. In this case, ensure coal is available before inserting into the boiler.\n\n### Errors Related to Power Connectivity\n- Ensure that all entities requiring power are connected to a functioning power network. Check connections with electric poles and ensure they are energized.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Ingredients in Furnaces\n- Regularly check and supply necessary ingredients to furnaces to avoid production halts.\n\n### Errors Due to Full Chests\n- Regularly empty chests to prevent mining drills from stopping due to full inventory."}
