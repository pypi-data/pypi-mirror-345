{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position(42.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 42.0, -83.0) - currently working and fueled with coal.\n- Burner inserter (position 42.5, -80.5) - waiting for source items (coal).\n- Wooden chest (position 42.5, -81.5) - normal status with coal inventory.\n- Burner inserter (position 43.5, -81.5) - waiting for space in destination (wooden chest).\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position(-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position -15.0, -50.0) - currently out of fuel.\n- Wooden chest (position -14.5, -48.5) - normal status with iron ore inventory.\n\n### Stone Furnace at position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position 0.0, 0.0) - currently has no ingredients and contains copper plates.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n- **Errors when using burner mining drill without fuel**\n  - Ensure that the burner mining drill is always fueled before attempting to use it. Check fuel levels regularly.\n  \n- **Errors when inserters are waiting for source items**\n  - Make sure that the source items (in this case, coal) are available in the connected entity (e.g., wooden chest) before the inserter is expected to operate.\n\n- **Errors when inserters are waiting for space in destination**\n  - Ensure that the destination entity (e.g., wooden chest) has enough space to accept items before attempting to insert.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - `refuel_entity(entity, fuel)` - Successfully refueled burner mining drill at (42.0, -83.0) multiple times.\n  \n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `burner_mining_drill_position`: Tuple (float, float) - Position of the burner mining drill.\n  - `wooden_chest_inventory`: Dictionary - Inventory of the wooden chest containing coal and iron ore.\n  - `stone_furnace_status`: String - Status of the stone furnace indicating it has no ingredients."}
