{"content": "\"\"\"\nThe attempt to craft the Assembling Machine failed because it requires a specific crafting or smelting machine to produce the necessary components, such as iron plates. This indicates that I need to ensure I am using the correct crafting station or that I have the appropriate setup for crafting.\n\n### Current Inventory Overview:\n- 4 pieces of stone furnaces\n- **8 pieces of iron plates** (available)\n- **18 pieces of copper cables**\n- **13 pieces of Iron Gear Wheels**\n\n### Furnace Status:\n- The furnace is still operational with **15 pieces of copper ore** and **10 pieces of copper plates** produced.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Check Crafting Stations**: I need to ensure that I have the right crafting station available to create the Assembling Machine. If I only have stone furnaces, I may need to build a more advanced crafting station.\n2. **Craft the Required Station**: If necessary, I can craft a new assembly station or upgrade my existing ones to allow for the crafting of the Assembling Machine.\n\nLet's check the available crafting stations and see if I can create the necessary one to craft the Assembling Machine.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Inspect current entities to check for available crafting stations\ncrafting_stations = get_entities({Prototype.AssemblingMachine1, Prototype.AssemblingMachine2, Prototype.AssemblingMachine3})\nif crafting_stations:\n    print(\"Available crafting stations found:\")\n    for station in crafting_stations:\n        print(f\" - {station.name} at Position: {station.position}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No crafting stations found.
