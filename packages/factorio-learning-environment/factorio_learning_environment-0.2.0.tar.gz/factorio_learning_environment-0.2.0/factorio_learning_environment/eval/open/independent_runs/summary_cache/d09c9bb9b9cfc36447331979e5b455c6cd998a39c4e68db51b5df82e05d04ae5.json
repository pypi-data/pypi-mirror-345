{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone processing setup at position(x=-50.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (position x=-50.0, y=0.0)\n- Stone furnace (position x=-54.0, y=0.0)\n- Wooden chest (position x=-51.5, y=0.5)\n- Burner inserter (position x=-51.5, y=-0.5)\n\n### Expanded stone processing setup at position(x=-50.0, y=2.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (position x=-50.0, y=0.0)\n- Stone furnace (position x=-47.0, y=2.0)\n- Wooden chest (position x=-49.5, y=2.5)\n- Burner inserter (position x=-48.5, y=2.5)\n- Assembling machine (position x=-41.5, y=2.5)\n- Additional burner inserter (position x=-45.5, y=2.5)\n- Output chest (position x=-39.5, y=2.5)\n\n### Production facility at position(x=20.0, y=20.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (position x=-46.0, y=21.0)\n- Stone furnace (position x=23.0, y=20.0)\n- Burner inserter (position x=21.5, y=20.5)\n- Assembling machine 2 (position x=26.5, y=20.5)\n- Assembler inserter (position x=24.5, y=20.5)\n- Output chest (position x=28.5, y=20.5)\n- Small electric pole (position x=26.5, y=18.5)\n\n### Partial power plant at position(x=24.5, y=17.0)\nConsists of:\n- Boiler (position x=24.5, y=17.0)\n- Small electric pole network (positions x=26.5,y=18.5 and x=28.5,y=18.5)\n\n### Stone collection point at position(x=-45.5, y=22.5)\nConsists of:\n- Wooden chest (position x=-45.5, y=22.5)\n- Burner inserter (position x=-44.5, y=22.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Placement validation errors (continued)\n- Verify terrain is completely clear before attempting to place entities (multiple failures on water tiles)\n- Check for existing entities in target placement area before attempting placement (failed boiler placement at occupied position)\n- Use proper spacing between entities (especially 2x2 and 3x3 buildings)\n- For power plants, verify water source availability before placing offshore pumps\n- Implement position scanning logic to find nearest valid placement location\n\n### Entity interaction errors (new)\n- Verify entity existence before attempting interactions (failed burner mining drill lookup at x=21.0,y=20.0)\n- Check entity attributes before accessing them (furnace.drop_position missing)\n- Ensure proper entity type checking before attempting connections (transport belt to furnace)\n- Handle missing entity cases gracefully with fallback logic\n\n### Inventory management errors\n- Check inventory contents before attempting to place items\n- Verify required materials are available before construction attempts\n- Check target inventory capacity before inserting items (boiler fuel insertion failed due to full inventory)\n\n### Production chain issues\n- Ensure all intermediate products are available before attempting complex crafts\n- Verify power supply before attempting electric operations\n- Handle missing resource cases gracefully with fallback logic\n\n### Recipe configuration issues\n- Verify building supports recipe setting before attempting\n- Check recipe requirements are met before configuration\n- Handle cases where recipe cannot be set due to missing ingredients\n\n### Power system problems (new)\n- Ensure proper electrical connections for all powered entities\n- Verify boiler has water input before operation\n- Check power network connectivity for assembling machines"}
