{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -48.0) with fuel inventory containing coal.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0) with fuel inventory containing coal.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0) with fuel inventory containing coal.\n- Multiple wooden chests positioned nearby for storing iron plates.\n\n### Iron Ore Extraction Site at Position (4.0, -60.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (4.0, -60.0) with warnings indicating it is out of fuel and the chest at the drop position is full.\n- Wooden Chest at position (4.5, -58.5) for storing extracted iron ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Insufficient Fuel for Burner Mining Drill\n- Ensure that there is enough coal in the inventory to refuel the burner mining drill. Consider automating the refueling process to prevent interruptions in mining operations.\n\n### Full Chests at Drop Position\n- Regularly check and empty chests at drop positions to prevent mining drills from halting due to full storage. Consider setting up an automated system to transfer items from these chests to a larger storage area.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `iron_ore_count: int` - Tracks the amount of iron ore extracted and stored.\n- `iron_plate_count: int` - Tracks the amount of iron plates produced and stored.\n- `coal_count: int` - Tracks the amount of coal available for fueling furnaces and drills."}
