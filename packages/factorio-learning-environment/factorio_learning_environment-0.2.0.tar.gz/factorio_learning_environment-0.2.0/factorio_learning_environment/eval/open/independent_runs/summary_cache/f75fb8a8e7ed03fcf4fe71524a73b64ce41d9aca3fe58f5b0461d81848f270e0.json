For example, avoid attempting to access the 'value' attribute on a 'str' object.\n\n### Errors with Clearing Chests\n- Verify that the chest you are trying to clear exists at the specified position and is of the correct type. Double-check the coordinates and ensure the entity type matches.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source items are available for inserters to pick up. Check the inventory of source chests and the configuration of inserters to ensure they are correctly aligned and operational.\n\n### Warnings about Full Chests\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are full to prevent disruptions in mining and production processes. This will ensure continuous operation of mining drills and inserters."}
