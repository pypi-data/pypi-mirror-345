The failures were due to collisions with existing entities or unplaceable terrain (notably water).\n\u2003\u2013 Tip: Validate candidate coordinates using buildability checks and bounding box feedback. Consider alternative directions or increased spacing to avoid collisions and terrain obstructions.\n\n\u2022 Pipe Connection Errors\n\u2003\u2013 Multiple attempts to pipe-connect the boiler (at Position(x=8.0, y=20.5)) to the steam engine (at Position(x=22.5, y=18.5)) failed\u2014errors indicated an inability to determine the required pipe count and connect the entities.\n\u2003\u2013 Tip: Ensure that the relative placement of entities permits seamless alignment of connection points. Reposition components or clear blocking entities to facilitate proper fluid system integration.\n\n\u2022 Use of Placement APIs\n\u2003\u2013 Error messages stating \u201cCould not place steam-engine\u201d indicate that the placement function rejected the target location due to obstructions or collision with existing terrain (e.g., water).\n\u2003\u2013 Tip: Perform pre-placement clearance and collision checks before issuing placement commands, and adjust target positions based on environmental constraints."}
