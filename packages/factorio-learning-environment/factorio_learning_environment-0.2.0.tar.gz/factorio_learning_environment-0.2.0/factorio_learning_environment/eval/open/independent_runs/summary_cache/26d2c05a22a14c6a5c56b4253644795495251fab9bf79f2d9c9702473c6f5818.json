{"content": "# Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\nCurrently, there are no structures on the map. All placement attempts have failed, and no entities have been successfully placed.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities on non-buildable tiles\n- Ensure that the tile is buildable before attempting to place any entity. Check for obstructions or terrain that may prevent placement.\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Verify that the target location is clear of other entities before placing a new entity. Attempting to place an entity where another already exists will result in failure.\n\n### Errors due to lack of available resources\n- Ensure that there are sufficient resources available to supply the entities. For example, ensure that coal is available when attempting to insert it into a furnace.\n\n### Errors when attempting to place entities without checking for nearby acceptors\n- Before inserting items into an entity, ensure that there is a nearby entity capable of accepting the items. This will prevent errors related to item insertion.\n\n### Errors due to incorrect placement of transport belts and chests\n- Confirm that the intended path for transport belts is clear and that chests are placed in buildable areas. This will prevent placement errors and ensure efficient resource transportation and storage."}
