{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0) with fuel inventory containing coal. It is currently working but has a warning indicating that the output is blocked by an item on the ground, and there is no sink entity to accept the output.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0) with fuel inventory containing coal. It has a warning indicating no ingredients to smelt and is currently in a status of no ingredients.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied or invalid locations\n- Ensure the target location is free and valid before attempting to place an entity. This includes checking for existing entities or blocked tiles.\n\n### Errors when moving entities to occupied or invalid locations\n- Verify that the destination location is unoccupied and suitable for the entity before attempting to move it.\n\n### Errors related to extracting or interacting with entities\n- Make sure to correctly reference and interact with entities. For example, ensure the entity type and position are correctly specified when using functions like `get_entity`.\n\n### Errors due to blocked outputs\n- Ensure that there is a clear path or sink entity available for the output of production entities like drills and furnaces to prevent blockage.\n\n### Errors due to missing ingredients\n- Check that all necessary ingredients are available and correctly supplied to entities like furnaces to maintain continuous production."}
