{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0) fueled by coal, smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter 1** at position (1.5, 0.5) transferring iron plates from the furnace to a wooden chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (2.5, 0.5) storing iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter 2** at position (3.5, 0.5) extracting iron plates from the wooden chest and placing them onto a transport belt.\n- **Transport Belt** connecting positions (3.5, 0.5) to (6.5, 0.5), moving iron plates along the line.\n- **Burner Inserter 3** at position (6.5, 0.5) transferring iron plates from the transport belt to an end chest.\n- **End Wooden Chest** at position (7.5, 0.5) collecting iron plates from the transport belt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Ensure there is no existing entity at the target position before placing a new entity. Consider increasing spacing, changing direction, or choosing a different reference position.\n\n### Errors when connecting belts directly from chests\n- Use an inserter to transfer items from a chest to a belt. Belts cannot be directly connected to chests.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient inventory resources\n- Ensure that you have the necessary resources in your inventory before attempting to place or craft an entity. For example, gather wood before crafting a wooden chest.\n\n### Errors when inserting items with insufficient inventory\n- Verify that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity.\n\n### Errors when crafting without required sub-ingredients\n- Gather all raw resources needed for crafting before attempting to craft an item. For instance, wood must be gathered before crafting a wooden chest."}
