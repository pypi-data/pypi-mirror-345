Check that there are no warnings like \"no input liquid\" or \"not connected to power network\" and resolve them.\n\n### Errors with Pipe Placement\n- Before placing a pipe, verify that the target position is clear of other entities. Remove any existing entities at the target location to avoid placement failures."}
