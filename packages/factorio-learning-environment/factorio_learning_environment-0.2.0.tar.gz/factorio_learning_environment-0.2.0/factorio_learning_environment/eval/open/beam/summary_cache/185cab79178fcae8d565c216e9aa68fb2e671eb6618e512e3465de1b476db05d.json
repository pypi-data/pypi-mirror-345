{"content": "I see the core issue now - we need stone to craft a stone furnace, but we don't have any stone in our inventory. Let's analyze what we learned from this interaction:\n\n**Current State:**\n- We have plenty of iron plates (61)\n- We have the required iron gear wheels (3)\n- We're missing stone to craft the stone furnace\n- We already have a burner mining drill in our inventory\n\n**Key Learnings:**\n1. Always check inventory contents before attempting crafting\n2. The stone furnace recipe requires 5 stone\n3. The burner mining drill recipe requires:\n   - 3 iron plates\n   - 3 iron gear wheels\n   - 1 stone furnace\n\n**Successful Actions:**\n1. We successfully maintained our iron gear wheels\n2. We correctly identified missing materials\n3. Our inventory checking logic works well\n\n**Failed Actions:**\n1. Couldn't craft stone furnace due to lack of stone\n2. Couldn't complete the burner mining drill crafting due to missing stone furnace\n\n**Recommendations for Future:**\n1. Implement a resource gathering phase before crafting\n2. Add stone collection to our priority list\n3. Use `nearest(Resource.Stone)` to find stone deposits\n4. Consider creating a prerequisite checking system before attempting crafting chains\n\nWould you like me to:\n1. Look for nearby stone deposits?\n2. Try to mine some stone?\n3. Or focus on a different goal since we already have a burner mining drill in our inventory?", "summary_range": "[1-2432]"}
