{"content": "Based on the provided logs, here is the updated report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Transport System at position(41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (x=41.0, y=-82.0) working on coal deposit\n- Iron chest (x=41.5, y=-83.5) storing coal\n- Wooden chest (x=41.5, y=-80.5) as intermediate storage\n- Burner inserter (x=42.5, y=-80.5) facing RIGHT to move coal\n- Transport belt (x=43.5, y=-80.5) facing RIGHT\n- Furnace inserter (x=44.5, y=-79.5) facing DOWN\n\n### Smelting Area around position(45.0, -81.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace (x=45.0, y=-81.0)\n- Stone furnace (x=47.0, y=-81.0)\n- Wooden chest (x=49.5, y=-80.5) storing iron plates\n\n### Transport System\n- Belt group running from (x=42.5, y=-68.5) to (x=42.5, y=-77.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n1. Entity Placement Conflicts\n- Ensure target location is clear before placing entities\n- Check for existing objects that might block placement\n- Verify terrain is suitable for placement (not water)\n\n2. Transport System Issues\n- When building transport systems, plan the layout carefully to avoid overlapping components\n- Place inserters first before connecting transport belts\n- Ensure proper spacing between components\n\n3. Entity Status Issues\n- Monitor entity status for \"WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION\" which indicates output blockage\n- Ensure proper connection between transport components to prevent item buildup\n- Check that furnaces have both fuel and ingredients to operate properly\n\nNAMESPACE\nImportant Variables:\n- furnace_inserter: BurnerInserter\n- transport_belt: TransportBelt\n\nSystem Status Indicators:\n- EntityStatus.WORKING: Entity is functioning normally\n- EntityStatus.WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION: Output is blocked\n- EntityStatus.NO_INGREDIENTS: Missing required inputs\n- EntityStatus.NORMAL: Entity is in normal state\n- EntityStatus.EMPTY: No items present"}
