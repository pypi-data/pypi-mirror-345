{"content": "Here's the updated report incorporating steps 104-111:\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Functional Iron Mining Operation at (16.0, 72.0)\n- Current components:\n  - Burner mining drill at (16.0, 72.0) (working but output blocked)\n  - Inserter at (17.5, 72.5) (working)\n  - Wooden chest at (18.5, 72.5) (empty)\n- Operational status:\n  - Drill has fuel (19 coal)\n  - Output blocked by ground items\n  - No belt connection established\n\n### Power Plants [STILL DISMANTLED]\n- Inventory shows available components:\n  - 3 boilers\n  - 2 steam engines\n  - 2 offshore pumps\n- No active power generation\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Placement Collision Errors (Critical Recurring)\n- Multiple placement failures (steps 104,105,108,109,111)\n- Required fixes:\n  1. Implement complete area scanning before placement\n  2. Add collision detection for all entity types\n  3. Create placement validation system\n\n### Distance Placement Errors (New Issue)\n- Entity placement too far (step 111)\n- Solutions:\n  1. Verify player proximity before placement\n  2. Implement movement to target before building\n  3. Add distance validation checks\n\n### Resource Verification (Improved but Needs Work)\n- Successful patch verification (step 111)\n- Still needs:\n  1. Automatic resource scanning\n  2. Valid mining position selection\n  3. Resource density analysis\n\n### Output Blockage (Critical Issue)\n- Drill output blocked (steps 107,110,111)\n- Required:\n  1. Automatic output clearing\n  2. Proper output path validation\n  3. Continuous monitoring system\n\n### Connection Validation (Persistent Problem)\n- Belt connection failures (steps 104,105,109)\n- Critical improvements:\n  1. Complete connection verification\n  2. Proper spacing calculations\n  3. Direction validation\n\n### Power System Urgency (Critical)\n- Still no power infrastructure\n- Immediate actions needed:\n  1. Prioritize power plant construction\n  2. Proper water source placement\n  3. Energy network planning\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Defined Functions\n1. `build_verified_mining(resource_type: Resource) -> Entity`\n   - Attempts validated mining setup\n   - Failures: Placement collisions (steps 104,108)\n\n2. `fix_mining_output() -> None`\n   - Handles output issues\n   - Partial success (step 110) but still blocked\n\n3. `verify_resource_patch(position: Position) -> bool`\n   - Resource verification\n   - Success (step 111) but needs range handling\n\n### Important Variables\n- `mining_pos: Position` (current mining location)\n- `output_blocked: bool` (status flag)\n- `placement_attempts: Dict[Position, int]` (tracking)"}
