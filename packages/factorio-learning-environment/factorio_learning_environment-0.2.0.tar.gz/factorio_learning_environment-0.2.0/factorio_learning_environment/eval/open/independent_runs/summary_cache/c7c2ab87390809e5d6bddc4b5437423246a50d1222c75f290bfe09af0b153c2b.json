{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Setup at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and deposits it into a nearby chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates but currently not receiving iron ore due to inserter setup issues.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied or restricted tiles\n- Ensure there is enough space and no collisions with existing entities before placing a new entity. Consider adjusting the spacing, direction, or reference position when placing entities like inserters or furnaces.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move closer to the target entity where you want to place or interact with before attempting the action. The maximum distance for placing entities is limited.\n\n### Inserter Setup Issues\n- Verify the alignment and positioning of inserters to ensure they can transfer items between entities effectively. Check if the inserter's pickup and drop positions are correctly set and unobstructed."}
