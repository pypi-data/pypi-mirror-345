{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Setup at (-15, -50)\nConsists of:\n- Two burner mining drills at positions (-19.0, -50.0) and (-15.0, -50.0)\n- Two wooden chests at positions (-18.5, -48.5) and (-14.5, -48.5) collecting ore from the drills\nBoth drills are operational with coal fuel and mining iron ore\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line at (0, 0)\nConsists of:\n- Two stone furnaces at positions (0.0, 0.0) and (2.0, 0.0)\n- Two input wooden chests at positions (-2.5, 0.5) and (4.5, 0.5)\n- Two burner inserters:\n  - At (-1.5, 0.5) moving items from first chest to first furnace\n  - At (3.5, 0.5) moving items from second chest to second furnace\nThe furnaces are operational with coal fuel and producing iron plates\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Entity Placement Distance\n- Move closer to target location before placing entities. Maximum placement distance is 10 tiles from player position\n\n### Errors with Resource Requirements\n- Ensure you have gathered required raw resources (like wood) before trying to craft items that need them\n- Check inventory has required items before placing entities\n- Verify you have fuel (coal) before trying to insert it into machines\n\n### Errors with Entity Placement Conflicts  \n- Check target position is clear before placing entities\n- When placing entities next to existing ones, ensure proper spacing to avoid overlap\n- Verify the terrain is suitable (not water) for entity placement\n- When placing mining drills, ensure the mining area contains resources\n\n### Errors with Building Box Calculations\n- Fix type error in building box width/height calculations - cannot multiply ModelPrivateAttr with integers\n\n### Resource Management\n- Monitor chest capacity - mining drills will stop if output chests are full"}
