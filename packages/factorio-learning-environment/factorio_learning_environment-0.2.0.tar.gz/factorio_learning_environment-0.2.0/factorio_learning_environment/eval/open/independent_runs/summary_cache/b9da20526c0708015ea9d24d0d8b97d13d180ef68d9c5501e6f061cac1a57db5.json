{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility at Position (-20, -70)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23, -68) connected via transport belts to a Wooden Chest at position (-23.5, -69.5).\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20, -70) for smelting copper ore into copper plates.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-14, -54)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14, -53) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -54.5).\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5) transferring items from the chest to another Wooden Chest at position (-12.5, -54.5).\n\n### Miscellaneous Storage Chests\n- Wooden Chest at position (-16.5, -64.5) containing iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-12.5, -54.5) containing iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5) containing coal, iron ore, and iron plates.\n\n### Belt Systems\n- Multiple BeltGroups connecting various entities, primarily for transporting resources between mining drills, furnaces, and chests.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Inserter Pickup Position\n- Ensure that the inserter's pickup position matches the source chest's position before attempting to transfer items. This can be done by verifying the coordinates of both the inserter and the chest to ensure alignment.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that there are items available for the inserter to pick up. This can be achieved by checking the inventory of the source entity and ensuring it is not empty.\n\n### Furnace with No Ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. This can be done by verifying the input inventory of the furnace and ensuring it contains the required raw materials."}
