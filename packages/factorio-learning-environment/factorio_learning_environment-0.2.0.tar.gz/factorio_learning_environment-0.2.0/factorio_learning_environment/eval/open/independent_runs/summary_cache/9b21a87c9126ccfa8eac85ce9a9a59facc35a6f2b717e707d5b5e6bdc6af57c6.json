{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Ore Mine and Smelting Operation at position(17.0, 71.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (16.0, 71.0)\n- Burner mining drill at position (18.0, 71.0)\n- Burner mining drill at position (20.0, 71.0)\n- Stone furnace at position (16.0, 73.0)\n- Stone furnace at position (18.0, 73.0)\n- Stone furnace at position (20.0, 73.0)\n- Burner inserter at position (16.5, 75.5) for furnace at (16.0, 73.0)\n- Burner inserter at position (18.5, 75.5) for furnace at (18.0, 73.0)\n- Burner inserter at position (20.5, 75.5) for furnace at (20.0, 73.0)\n- Wooden chest at position (16.5, 76.5) for output inserter at (16.5, 75.5)\n- Wooden chest at position (20.5, 76.5) for output inserter at (20.5, 75.5)\n\n#### Electricity Generator at position(-6.0, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, -0.5)\n- Boiler at position (-7.5, 0.0)\n- Pipe group connecting boiler to steam engine at positions (-6.5, -1.5), (-7.5, -1.5), (-4.5, -1.5), (-5.5, -1.5), (-3.5, -0.5), (-3.5, -1.5)\n- Steam engine at position (-3.5, 2.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when placing entities too close to other entities\n- Ensure that there is enough space between entities when placing them. For example, when placing a burner inserter next to a furnace, make sure there are no other entities occupying the space where the inserter will be placed.\n\n#### Errors when placing entities on unplaceable terrain or occupied positions\n- Check the terrain and existing entities before placing a new entity. For instance, ensure that the target location is not water or already occupied by another entity.\n\n#### Errors when connecting entities directly\n- Transport belts cannot be connected directly to a Prototype.WoodenChest object as a target. You need to add an inserter that inputs items into Prototype.WoodenChest and use the inserter as the target entity.\n- Transport belts cannot be connected directly from a Prototype.StoneFurnace object as a source. You need to add an inserter that takes items from Prototype.StoneFurnace and use the inserter as a source entity.\n\n#### Common mistakes and their solutions\n- Increasing the spacing between entities can help avoid placement errors.\n- Changing the direction of entity placement can also resolve issues related to entity proximity.\n- Verifying the reference position for entity placement is crucial to avoid conflicts with existing entities.\n- Undefined variables should be checked before use to avoid NameError exceptions.\n- Ensure that entities are properly connected (e.g., fluid connections for offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine).\n\n#### New Errors\n- Exception: ('Could not get Prototype.BurnerInserter at position x=16.0 y=72.0', Exception('No entity of type burner-inserter found at the specified position.,')) \n  - Solution: Check the position and existence of the entity before attempting to access it.\n- Furnaces not working due to EntityStatus.NO_FUEL\n  - Solution: Ensure furnaces are fueled properly.\n- Burner mining drills not working due to lack of fuel\n  - Solution: Fuel the drills regularly.\n\n#### Tips for Fueling and Entity Status\n- Burner mining drills and furnaces need to be fueled to function properly.\n- Regularly check the fuel levels of drills and furnaces to avoid production halts.\n\n### NAMESPACE\nNo utility functions have been defined by the agent in the given logs."}
