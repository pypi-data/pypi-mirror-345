(Updated status: NO_FUEL; connection points: (-5.5, 22.5) and (-5.5, 26.5); steam output at (-7.5, 24.5))\n- Offshore Pump at position(-9.5, 24.5) for water extraction.\n- Steam Engine at position(2.5, 21.5) for electricity generation with connection points at (5.0, 21.5) and (0.0, 21.5); current status: NOT_CONNECTED with warnings [\u201cnot connected to power network\u201d, \u201cno input liquid\u201d, \u201cno fluid present in connections\u201d].\n- Pipeline Network: Repeated attempts were made to merge working PipeGroups (fluid_systems 2172, 2215, 2258, 2301, 2344, 2387, 2430, and 2473) with the steam engine. New pipe placements at positions (0.0, 21.5) and offset at (0.5, 21.5) failed due to obstructions and absence of a valid working PipeGroup, leaving the connection incomplete.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 PipeGroup Availability and Merge Failures:\n\u2003\u2013 Verify that a valid, working PipeGroup exists for the intended fluid system before attempting any merge or connection.\n\u2003\u2013 The repeated \u201cNo working PipeGroup found\u201d errors (for systems 2172, 2215, 2258, 2301, 2344, 2387, 2430, 2473) indicate a need for pre-validation of the fluid network\u2019s readiness.\n\n\u2022 Pipe Placement Obstructions:\n\u2003\u2013 Ensure that the target connection points, such as (0.0, 21.5) and (0.5, 21.5), are free from existing objects before placing new pipes.\n\u2003\u2013 Clear the area or adjust placement offsets to avoid conflicts with already placed entities.\n\n\u2022 Multi-Segment Pipeline Connection Challenges:\n\u2003\u2013 When constructing two-segment pipelines, confirm that intermediate waypoints align correctly with both source and target connection points.\n\u2003\u2013 Re-validate each segment\u2019s placement to ensure unobstructed connection and network stability.\n\n\u2022 General Connection and Repositioning:\n\u2003\u2013 Double-check that source and target connection endpoints are within the allowed placement range and free of obstructions prior to initiating merge attempts."}
