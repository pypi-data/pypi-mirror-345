Regularly check and empty chests to prevent overflow and warnings.\n\n### Errors with Mining Operations\n- Ensure that the drop position for the mining drill is not obstructed by a full chest. Regularly empty the chest at the drop position to continue mining operations without interruptions.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- None defined in the current steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `wooden-chest`: int, count of wooden chests in inventory\n- `wood`: int, count of wood in inventory\n- `coal`: int, count of coal in inventory\n- `iron-ore`: int, count of iron ore in inventory\n- `iron-plate`: int, count of iron plates in inventory\n- `iron-gear-wheel`: int, count of iron gear wheels in inventory"}
