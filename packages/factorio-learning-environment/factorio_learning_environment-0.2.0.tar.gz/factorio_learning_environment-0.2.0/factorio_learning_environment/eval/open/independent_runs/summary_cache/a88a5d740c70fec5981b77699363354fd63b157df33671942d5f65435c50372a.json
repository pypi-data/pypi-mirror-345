Check the status of the poles to confirm they are plugged into the electric network.\n\n### Errors when placing small electric poles\n- Ensure there is no existing object in the way before attempting to place a small electric pole. Check the area for obstructions.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient inventory\n- Always check your inventory before attempting to place entities. Ensure you have the required items, such as small electric poles, before trying to place them.\n\n### Errors when accessing entity attributes\n- Verify that the attributes you are trying to access on entities exist. For example, ensure that the 'energy' attribute is available for the entity type you are working with."}
