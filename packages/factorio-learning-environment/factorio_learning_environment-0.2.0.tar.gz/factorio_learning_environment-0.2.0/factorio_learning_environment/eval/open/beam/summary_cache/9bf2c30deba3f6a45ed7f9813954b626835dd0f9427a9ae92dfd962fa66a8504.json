{"content": "The error indicates that the function `ensure_craftable` is not defined in the current context. This could happen if the function was not created or if the context was reset, causing the loss of previously defined functions.\n\n### Summary of Actions Taken:\n1. We attempted to ensure we had enough resources to craft a wooden chest.\n2. We tried to place the chest to store excess iron plates.\n3. The attempt to call `ensure_craftable` resulted in a `NameError`.\n\n### Recommendations to Avoid Future Errors:\n1. **Define Utility Functions**: Before using utility functions like `ensure_craftable`, ensure they are defined in the current context. If you encounter a `NameError`, check if the function exists or redefine it if necessary.\n\n2. **Check Inventory Before Crafting**: Instead of relying on a utility function, you can directly check your inventory to see if you have enough resources to craft the wooden chest. If not, gather the necessary materials first.\n\n3. **Use Basic Crafting Logic**: If utility functions are not available, you can manually check the recipe for the wooden chest and gather the required materials (wood, in this case) before crafting.\n\n### Next Steps:\nLet's manually check our inventory for the required materials to craft a wooden chest and proceed accordingly.\n\n1. **Check Inventory for Required Materials**: \n   - Wooden chests typically require wood. Let's inspect our inventory to see if we have enough wood to craft the chest.\n\n2. **Gather Wood if Necessary**: \n   - If we lack wood, we should find a nearby tree, gather wood, and then craft the chest.\n\n3. **Craft the Wooden Chest**: \n   - Once we have the required materials, we can craft the wooden chest and proceed to store the iron plates.\n\nLet's start by checking the inventory. \n\n```python\n# Check the inventory for wood\ninventory = inspect_inventory()\nwood_available = inventory.get(Prototype.Wood, 0)\nprint(f\"Available wood: {wood_available}\")\n```", "summary_range": "[1-196]"}
