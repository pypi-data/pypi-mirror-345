{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=-1.5, y=24.0)\nConsists of:\n- Boiler at position (x=-1.5, y=24.0) with no input liquid and not connected to any fluid systems.\n- Steam Engine at position (x=5.5, y=21.5) with no input liquid and not connected to the power network.\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5) with no fluid present in connections.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) fueled with coal and producing iron plates.\n\n### Research Lab\nConsists of:\n- Lab with automation science packs but currently not powered.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Boiler Dimensions\n- Ensure that when accessing or manipulating boiler dimensions, the attributes are correctly defined and accessible. Avoid using undefined attributes like `tile_dimensions` directly without confirming their existence.\n\n### Type Errors in Calculations\n- When performing arithmetic operations, ensure that all operands are of compatible types. Convert `ModelPrivateAttr` to a compatible numerical type before performing operations like addition.\n\n### Errors in Connecting Entities\n- Verify that all required items, such as pipes, are available in the inventory before attempting to connect entities like the offshore pump and boiler.\n- Ensure that the entities being connected are correctly positioned and accessible for the connection operation.\n\n### Inventory Management for Connections\n- Before attempting to connect entities, check the inventory to ensure that all necessary items are available to complete the connection process."}
