{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Complex (around x=0, y=0)\nConsists of:\n- 4 pairs of stone furnaces at positions (0,0), (2,0), (4,0), (6,0)\n- Input wooden chests at positions (0.5,-2.5), (2.5,-2.5), (4.5,-2.5), (6.5,-2.5)\n- Output wooden chests at positions (0.5,2.5), (2.5,2.5), (4.5,2.5), (6.5,2.5)\n- Input burner inserters at positions (0.5,-1.5), (2.5,-1.5), (4.5,-1.5), (6.5,-1.5)\n- Output burner inserters at positions (0.5,1.5), (2.5,1.5), (4.5,1.5), (6.5,1.5)\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Area (around x=-8, y=-59)\nConsists of:\n- 3 burner mining drills at positions (-10,-59), (-8,-59), (-6,-59)\n- 3 wooden chests collecting iron ore at positions (-9.5,-57.5), (-7.5,-57.5), (-5.5,-57.5)\n\n### Copper Processing Area (around x=-25, y=-59)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-28,-61) connected to stone furnace at (-27,-59)\n- Input burner inserter at (-28.5,-58.5)\n- Output burner inserter at (-25.5,-58.5)\n- Output wooden chest at (-24.5,-58.5) storing copper plates\n- Additional furnaces at (-23,-58) and (-21,-58) with associated burner inserters\n- Collection chest at (-22.5,-55.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting entities\n- Cannot connect belts directly from wooden chests - use inserters instead to move items from chests to belts\n\n### Entity placement collision errors\n- When placing inserters or other entities, ensure there is enough space and no collisions with existing structures\n- Check the spacing parameter when placing entities next to each other\n- Consider the direction of placement and adjust reference positions to avoid collisions with existing entities\n\n### Blocked output warnings\n- Several burner mining drills have blocked outputs - ensure there are appropriate sink entities (like chests or belts) to collect the mined resources\n- Some furnace belts are blocked - verify the output path is clear and has capacity"}
