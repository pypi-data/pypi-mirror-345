{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-16.0, -51.0) with fuel inventory containing coal and a status of working. The drill outputs iron ore to a drop position at (-16.5, -52.5).\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) with fuel inventory containing coal. The furnace is currently not smelting due to a lack of ingredients but has a result inventory containing iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied or invalid locations\n- Ensure that the desired location for placing entities such as Wooden Chests, Burner Inserters, Stone Furnaces, and Transport Belts is free from other entities or obstructions. Check the tile before attempting to place an entity.\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities from specific positions\n- Verify the existence of entities like Stone Furnaces at specified positions before attempting to retrieve them. Ensure that the coordinates are correct and that the entity is present at that location.\n\n### Errors when inserting items without available inventory\n- Check your inventory to ensure you have the necessary items, such as coal, before attempting to insert them into other entities like drills.\n\n### Errors due to blocked outputs\n- Ensure that the output of entities like Burner Mining Drills is not blocked by items on the ground. Place a sink entity, such as a chest or belt, to accept the output and prevent blockage.\n\n### Errors due to missing ingredients for smelting\n- Ensure that the Stone Furnace has the necessary ingredients, such as iron ore, to smelt. Regularly supply the furnace with the required materials to maintain production."}
