{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-13.5, 20.0)\nConsists of boiler (position -13.5, 20.0), steam engine (position -18.5, 19.5), and offshore pump (position -11.5, 26.5). The boiler is currently out of fuel, and the steam engine is not connected to the power network.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(-18.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position -18.0, -49.0) and a furnace at position (-18.0, -49.0).\n\n### Lab at position(-17.5, 23.5)\nConsists of a lab (position -17.5, 23.5) which is currently not powered.\n\n### Pipe network\nConsists of multiple pipe groups connecting various entities:\n- PipeGroup (fluid system=37906, position -12.5, 21.5)\n- PipeGroup (fluid system=37903, position -18.5, 16.5)\n- Additional pipe groups at positions (-9.5, 21.5), (-10.5, 22.5), and (-6.5, 23.5).\n\n### Electricity network\nConsists of multiple small electric poles, with the main group located around position (-16.5, 20.5).\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to fuel supply\n- Ensure you have enough coal in your inventory to refuel the boiler before attempting to insert it. Check your inventory regularly to avoid running out of necessary resources.\n\n### Errors when connecting power\n- Verify that the steam engine is properly connected to the power network. Check all connections and ensure that the small electric poles are within range.\n\n### Errors when inserting items\n- Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities. If you receive an error about not being able to insert, check your inventory for the specific item.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity in a tile before attempting to do so. Check for existing entities that may block placement."}
