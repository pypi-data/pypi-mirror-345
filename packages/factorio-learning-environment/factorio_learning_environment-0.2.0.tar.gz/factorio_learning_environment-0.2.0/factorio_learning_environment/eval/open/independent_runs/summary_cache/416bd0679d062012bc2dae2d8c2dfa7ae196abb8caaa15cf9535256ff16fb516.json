For example, attempting to extract copper ore from a chest that does not have enough copper ore will fail.\n- Verify the entity's inventory before attempting to extract items.\n\n#### Errors when extracting from furnaces\n- Ensure the furnace has finished smelting and contains the item you are trying to extract. For example, attempting to extract iron plates from a furnace that is still smelting or has no iron plates will fail.\n\n#### Errors when inserting items into entities\n- Ensure the entity you are inserting into has space for the item. For example, inserting iron ore into a furnace that is already full will fail.\n\n#### Errors when mining with burner mining drills\n- Ensure the chest at the drop position of the burner mining drill is not full. If the chest is full, the drill will stop mining and issue a warning.\n\n#### Errors when using burner inserters\n- Ensure the burner inserter has fuel and is correctly oriented to pick up and drop items. If the inserter is out of fuel or waiting for source items, it will not function.\n\n#### Errors when extracting from furnaces with insufficient items\n- Ensure the furnace has the required amount of items before attempting to extract. For example, attempting to extract 10 iron plates from a furnace that only has 4 will fail.\n\n#### General tips\n- Always check the status and warnings of entities before interacting with them to avoid errors.\n- Ensure entities have the necessary fuel and ingredients to operate."}
