{"content": "I can now provide an analysis of the interaction with the Factorio API:\n\n**Attempted Goals:**\n1. Move to the drill's location\n2. Clean up existing furnaces\n3. Place a new furnace with proper spacing\n4. Place an inserter between drill and furnace\n5. Rotate inserter to face the right direction\n6. Add fuel to all machines\n\n**Errors Encountered:**\n1. Initial attempts failed due to being too far from build location\n2. Drill is showing \"WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION\" status\n3. Multiple inserters are present in the area causing conflicts\n4. Furnace showing \"NO_FUEL\" despite adding fuel\n\n**Outcomes:**\n- Successfully moved to drill location\n- Successfully placed new furnace and inserter\n- System is not functioning properly due to:\n  - Drill output being blocked\n  - Multiple inserters in the area interfering\n  - Fuel not being properly utilized\n\n**Tips for Future API Interactions:**\n1. Always check and clear existing entities before placing new ones\n2. Verify entity positions and spacing carefully\n3. Use proper sequence for setup:\n   - Move to location first\n   - Clear area\n   - Place larger entities (furnaces, drills)\n   - Place smaller entities (inserters)\n   - Add fuel last\n4. Check entity status after each major step\n5. Pay attention to entity directions and rotations\n6. Consider using `get_entities()` with a radius parameter to check nearby entities\n7. Ensure proper spacing between entities (at least 1 tile)\n8. Monitor warnings in entity status\n\n**Successful Patterns:**\n1. Moving to location before building\n2. Using `place_entity_next_to()` with proper spacing\n3. Rotating entities after placement\n4. Adding fuel to all machines systematically\n5. Checking entity status for debugging\n\nFor the next attempt, we should:\n1. Clear ALL entities in the work area first\n2. Rebuild from scratch with proper spacing\n3. Ensure inserter alignment matches drill output\n4. Verify fuel is being consumed properly\n5. Monitor the system for proper operation", "summary_range": "[1-3312]"}
