{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) connected to a wooden chest at position (52.5, -84.5) and another chest at position (54.5, -84.5). The drill is currently waiting for space in the destination chest.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Storage Facility at Position (-23.0, -68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) connected to a wooden chest at position (-23.5, -69.5) and another chest at position (-24.5, -67.5). The drill is out of fuel.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) connected to a wooden chest at position (-14.5, -54.5) and a burner inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5) which is waiting for source items.\n- Wooden chests at positions (-12.5, -54.5) and (-14.5, -54.5) storing iron ore and copper plate.\n\n### Copper Plate Smelting Facility at Position (0.0, 0.0) and (5.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnaces at positions (0.0, 0.0) and (5.0, 0.0), both with no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Transport Belt System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (1.5, 1.5) to (3.5, 1.5) and (3.5, 2.5) to (5.5, 2.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using non-callable objects\n- Ensure that the objects you are trying to interact with are callable. For example, avoid treating 'Chest' objects as callable functions.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placement.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items."}
