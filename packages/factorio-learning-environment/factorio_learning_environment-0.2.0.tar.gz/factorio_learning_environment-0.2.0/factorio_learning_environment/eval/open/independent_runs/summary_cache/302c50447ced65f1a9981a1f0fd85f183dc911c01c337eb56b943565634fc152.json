{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-25.0, -64.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-25.0, -64.0) connected to a Stone Furnace at position (-23.0, -66.0) via transport belts.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-24.5, -66.5) storing iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-20.5, -65.5) transferring items from a Wooden Chest at position (-21.5, -65.5) to a Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -65.0).\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage Facility at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -54.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5).\n- Burner Inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) transferring items to the Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5).\n\n### Belt Groups\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (-25.5, -65.5) to (-23.5, -65.5).\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (-24.5, -64.5) to (-22.5, -64.5).\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (-14.5, -54.5) to (-17.5, -59.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Transport Belts\n- Ensure that the entities you are trying to connect with transport belts are not `NoneType` objects. Verify that the entities exist and have valid attributes before attempting to connect them.\n\n### Errors with Output Blocked by Items on the Ground\n- Make sure there is a sink entity in place to accept the output from mining drills or furnaces to prevent blockage. Check that the output path is clear and that there are no items obstructing the flow.\n\n### Errors with Furnaces Having No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Ensure that the furnaces have the required ingredients to smelt. Verify that inserters or transport belts are correctly supplying the necessary materials to the furnaces."}
