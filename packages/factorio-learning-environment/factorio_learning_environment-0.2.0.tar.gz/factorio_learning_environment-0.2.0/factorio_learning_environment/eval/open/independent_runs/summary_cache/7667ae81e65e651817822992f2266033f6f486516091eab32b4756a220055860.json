{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Furnace at position(0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position (0, 0)) with current inventory holding 100 copper plates. The furnace is currently out of ingredients to smelt and has a full result inventory.\n\n### Chest at position(2.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest (position (2.5, 0.5)) with an inventory holding 116 copper plates.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n- Errors when crafting automation science pack:\n  - Ensure that you have the required ingredients available in the furnace or a crafting machine. In this case, copper plates are needed to craft the automation science pack, and the furnace is currently not producing any due to lack of ingredients.\n  \n- Errors when transferring items:\n  - Confirm that the source entity has enough items to transfer before attempting to transfer them. The logs indicate that there were attempts to transfer copper plates when there were none available in the inventory.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- Functions defined:\n  - `craft_item(Prototype.AutomationSciencePack)`: This function has failed multiple times due to insufficient ingredients.\n\n- Important variables assigned:\n  - `current_inventory`: dict[str, int] = {'stone-furnace': 1, 'wood': 6, 'iron-plate': 48, 'automation-science-pack': 61}\n  - `furnace_inventory`: dict[str, int] = {'copper-plate': 100}\n  - `chest_inventory`: dict[str, int] = {'copper-plate': 116}"}
