{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-10.0, -50.0)\nThis facility is responsible for producing iron plates. It consists of:\n- **Furnace** at position (-10.0, -50.0) which is currently not producing due to lack of ingredients.\n- **Burner Inserters** at positions (-10.5, -48.5), (-7.5, -49.5), and (-5.5, -49.5) that are refueled and waiting for source items.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-8.5, -49.5) which currently has 0 iron ore.\n- **BeltGroup** that connects various entities, facilitating the movement of resources.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Site at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nThis site is responsible for extracting iron ore. It consists of:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-14.0, -53.0) which is operational but has its output blocked.\n- **BeltGroup** that attempts to transport extracted ore but faces connectivity issues.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Connecting Transport Belts\n- **Issue**: Attempting to connect transport belts directly to a wooden chest or stone furnace.\n- **Solution**: Use an inserter to connect transport belts to these entities.\n\n### Errors in Path Normalization for Transport Belts\n- **Issue**: Failed to connect transport belts due to invalid path normalization.\n- **Solution**: Ensure that the path for connecting belts is valid and properly aligned.\n\n### Errors Due to Inventory Shortages\n- **Issue**: Attempting to insert coal into entities when there is no coal available in the inventory.\n- **Solution**: Verify inventory levels before attempting to insert items into entities. Ensure sufficient resources are available.\n\n### Low Iron Plate Production\n- **Issue**: Iron plate production is low due to lack of iron ore in the chest.\n- **Solution**: Investigate the supply chain to ensure iron ore is being delivered to the furnace efficiently. Check for blockages or misconfigurations in the transport belts or inserters."}
