{"content": "I'll create a report based on the provided logs:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining System at (-15, -50)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill mining coal (position -15, -50)\n- Wooden chest for storage (position -13.5, -50.5)\n- Burner inserter for fuel (position -14.5, -51.5)\n- Burner inserter for output (position -12.5, -50.5)\n- Connected to transport belt system\n\n### Iron Smelting System at (45-47, -80)\nConsists of:\n- Two stone furnaces (positions 45, -80 and 47, -80)\n- Two input wooden chests (positions 45.5, -82.5 and 47.5, -82.5)\n- Two burner inserters for input (positions 45.5, -81.5 and 47.5, -81.5)\n- Output storage chests (positions 49.5, -80.5 and 49.5, -79.5)\n- Complex belt system connecting components\n\n### Transport System\nMultiple belt groups connecting mining and smelting operations:\n- Main belt line from mining (-10.5, -50.5) to smelting (44.5, -81.5)\n- Secondary belt system (48.5, -80.5 to 43.5, -80.5)\n- Additional belt group (52.5, -81.5 to 56.5, -81.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Placement Errors\n- Ensure target location is clear before placing inserters\n- Check for existing entities that might block inserter placement\n- Verify terrain is suitable for placement (not water or other unplaceable surfaces)\n\n### Entity Blocking Issues\n- Clear existing entities before attempting to rebuild/replace structures\n- When rebuilding systems, ensure proper removal sequence of old components\n- Check for belt interference when placing new components\n\n### Operational Issues\n- Mining drills lacking fuel need regular coal supply\n- Transport belts showing blockage issues need clearing\n- Monitor chest capacity to prevent overflow (chest at 49.5, -80.5 is full)\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nFunctions:\n- place_entity(): Places entities in the world, fails when location is blocked\n- rebuild_inserter_layout(): Manages inserter placement and configuration\n- rebuild_belt_and_inserter_system(): Handles belt and inserter system reconstruction\n\nImportant Variables:\n- input_inserter1, input_inserter2: BurnerInserter type\n- furnace_positions: List[Position]\n- belt_positions: List[Position]"}
