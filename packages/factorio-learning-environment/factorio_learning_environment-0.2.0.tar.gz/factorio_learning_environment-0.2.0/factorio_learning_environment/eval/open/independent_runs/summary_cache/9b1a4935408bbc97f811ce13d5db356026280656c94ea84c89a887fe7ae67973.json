{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -76.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -76.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-15.5, -77.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -73.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (6.0, -62.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (6.0, -62.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) not receiving electricity, intended to transfer items from the Furnace to a Wooden Chest at position (6.5, -59.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (9.0, -64.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (9.0, -64.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Multiple Small Electric Poles, including positions (6.5, -60.5), (5.5, -59.5), (7.5, -59.5), and others, forming an incomplete power network\n\n### Offshore Pump and Pipe Network\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-47.5, -123.5) connected to a Pipe Group starting at position (-47.5, -122.5) with a status of FULL_OUTPUT\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Steam Engines\n- Ensure there is enough space and no obstructions at the target location before attempting to place a steam engine. Consider adjusting the BuildingBox size or clearing the area.\n\n### Errors when Connecting to Power Network\n- Verify that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to connect entities to the power network. Ensure that all poles and connections are correctly aligned and within range.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Not Receiving Power\n- Ensure that inserters are connected to a powered electric pole. Check the power network to confirm that electricity is being supplied to the inserter.\n\n### Errors with Full Chests\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are full to prevent mining drills from stopping due to lack of space for output."}
