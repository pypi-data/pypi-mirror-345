{"content": "I'll create a report based on the provided logs.\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Transport System at position(41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill positioned at (41.0, -82.0)\n- Wooden chest at (41.5, -80.5) for coal storage\n- Output inserter at (42.5, -80.5) moving coal from chest to belt\n- Belt system consisting of 2 transport belts:\n  - Belt at (43.5, -80.5) pointing right\n  - Belt at (44.5, -80.5) pointing right\n\n### Coal Processing Structure\nConsists of:\n- Furnace inserter at (45.5, -79.5) \n- Stone furnace at (47.0, -80.0)\nThe structure is connected to the coal mining system via transport belts\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Collision Errors\n- Before placing entities, ensure the target location is clear of any items on ground\n- Check for existing entities that might block placement\n- Verify that the terrain is suitable for placement (not water)\n\n### Belt System Blockage\n- Clear blocked belts to maintain proper flow of materials\n- Monitor belt contents to prevent backup and ensure smooth operation\n\n### Fuel Management\n- Monitor fuel levels in burner devices\n- Implement refueling logic before entities run out of fuel\n- Current example: Mining drill has run out of fuel and stopped working\n\n### Entity Positioning\n- Verify that inserters are properly aligned with their pickup and drop positions\n- Ensure correct spacing between connected entities\n- Double-check entity positions after placement to confirm proper alignment\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nImportant Variables:\n- Position coordinates (x, y): float\n- Direction: enum (RIGHT, LEFT, UP, DOWN)\n- EntityStatus: enum (WORKING, NO_FUEL, WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS, WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION, NO_INGREDIENTS)\n- Inventory contents: dict[str, int]\n\nFunctions Observed:\n- place_entity(): Places entity at specific coordinates\n- place_entity_next_to(): Places entity adjacent to existing entity\n  Success: When target location is clear\n  Failure: When collision detected or invalid terrain"}
