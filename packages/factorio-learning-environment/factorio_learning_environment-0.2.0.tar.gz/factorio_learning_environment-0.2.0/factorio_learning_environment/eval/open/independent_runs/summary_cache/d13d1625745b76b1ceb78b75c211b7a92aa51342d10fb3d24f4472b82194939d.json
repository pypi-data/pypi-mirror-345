{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Cable Factory at Position(2.5, 17.5)\nConsists of the following interconnected entities:\n- Burner Inserter at Position(3.5, 17.5) deployed at the factory interface.\n- Burner Inserter at Position(2.5, 16.5) (retrieved and used as a connection point).\n- Cable Factory Input Chest at Position(2.5, 17.5) serving as the resource inlet.\n- Assembling Machine at Position(1.5, 19.5) receiving items for copper cable production.\n\n### Depot Belt System at Position(3.5, 15.5)\nConsists of the following entities arranged for isolating belt connections:\n- Wooden Chest (belt depot) at Position(3.5, 15.5) crafted and successfully placed.\n- Transport Belt Segment at Position(4.5, 15.5) positioned adjacent to the depot chest.\n- Depot Burner Inserter at Position(3.5, 14.5) installed to interface with incoming items.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n\u2022 Transport Belt Connection Errors  \n\u2003- When attempting to connect transport belts, the target was repeatedly misinterpreted as a Prototype.SteamEngine.  \n\u2003- Use an inserter that feeds into the steam engine instead of directly targeting it for all belt connections.\n\n\u2022 Entity Placement Distance Error  \n\u2003- A wooden chest placement failed because the target location (3.5, 15.5) was too far from the player\u2019s (0, 0) position.  \n\u2003- Move closer to the intended placement position to satisfy the maximum distance requirement.\n\n\u2022 Inventory Shortage Error  \n\u2003- Placement of the wooden chest later failed due to the item not being present in the inventory.  \n\u2003- Verify that the necessary entity is available before attempting placement.\n\n\u2022 Variable Reference Error  \n\u2003- An undefined variable (\u2018target_chest\u2019) was referenced, resulting in a NameError.  \n\u2003- Ensure all variables are correctly defined and referenced to avoid such errors."}
