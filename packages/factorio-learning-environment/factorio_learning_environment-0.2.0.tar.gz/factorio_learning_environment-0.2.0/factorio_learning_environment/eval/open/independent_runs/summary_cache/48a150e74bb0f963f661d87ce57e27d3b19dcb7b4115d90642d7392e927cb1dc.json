{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Transport System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-28.0, y=-61.0) with drop position at (x=-27.5, y=-59.5)\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-33.0, y=-64.0) with drop position at (x=-32.5, y=-62.5)\n- BeltGroup connecting various positions for resource transport:\n  - Inputs: Belt from (x=-28.5, y=-64.5) to (x=-30.5, y=-64.5), direction LEFT\n  - Outputs: Belt from (x=-28.5, y=-64.5) to (x=-30.5, y=-64.5), direction LEFT\n  - Additional belt connections facilitating transport from (x=-25.5, y=-64.5) to (x=-27.5, y=-64.5), and other positions\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with status EntityStatus.FULL_OUTPUT\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=3.0, y=0.0) with status EntityStatus.FULL_OUTPUT\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=6.0, y=0.0) with status EntityStatus.FULL_OUTPUT\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=0.5, y=1.5) waiting for source items, picking up from (x=-0.5, y=1.5) and dropping at (x=1.5, y=1.5)\n\n### Storage and Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-31.5, y=-61.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-26.5, y=-60.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=1.5, y=1.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-25.5, y=-61.5) to collect excess items\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-27.5, y=-61.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-32.5, y=-62.5) to collect resources from the burner mining drill\n\n### Belt Network\nConsists of multiple BeltGroups facilitating resource transport across various positions:\n- BeltGroup with inputs and outputs connecting positions such as (x=-26.5, y=-62.5) to (x=-28.5, y=-62.5), and others\n- BeltGroup with connections from (x=-25.5, y=-61.5) to (x=-23.5, y=-61.5), and others\n- BeltGroup connecting chest at (x=-32.5, y=-62.5) to the belt network\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities on Occupied Tiles\n- Ensure that the target location is clear of any existing objects before attempting to place a new entity, such as a burner mining drill.\n\n### Errors Connecting Belts Due to Missing Inventory Items\n- Verify that the required items, such as transport belts, are available in the inventory before attempting to connect entities.\n\n### Crafting Errors Due to Missing Ingredients\n- Ensure that all necessary ingredients, like iron plates and iron gear wheels, are available in the inventory before attempting to craft items.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source items are available for the inserter to function properly.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Space in Destination\n- Place a sink object at the specified drop position to prevent the inserter from being blocked due to full destination space.\n\n### Furnace No Ingredients Error\n- Continuously monitor and supply necessary ingredients to furnaces to maintain production efficiency. Ensure that iron ore is consistently supplied to furnaces.\n\n### Errors Connecting Belts Due to Distance\n- Ensure that the player is within the maximum allowable distance from the target position when placing transport belts. Move closer if necessary.\n\n### Repeated Errors Connecting Belts\n- Repeated attempts to connect belts without having the required items in the inventory will result in errors. Ensure inventory checks are performed before connection attempts.\n\n### Fuel Insertion Errors\n- Confirm that the fuel type and quantity are available in the inventory before attempting to insert into a burner mining drill or similar entity.\n\n### Crafting Errors Due to Missing Sub-Ingredients\n- When crafting complex items, ensure that all sub-ingredients are available or can be crafted. For example, crafting transport belts requires iron-gear-wheels, which in turn require iron plates.\n\n### Errors with Incorrect Argument Types\n- When using functions, ensure that the correct argument types are passed. For example, when inserting items, the second argument must be an Entity or EntityGroup, not a Position.\n\n### Errors with Insufficient Fuel\n- Ensure that all entities"}
