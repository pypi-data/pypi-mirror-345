{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Coal Mine at position (41, -82)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (position (41, -82)) with fuel source (coal) and drop position at (40.5, -83.5)\n- Chest (position (40.5, -83.5)) to store coal\n- Another chest (position (41.5, -83.5)) to store coal\n\n### Coal Transport System at position (39.5, -81.5)\nConsists of:\n- Burner inserter (position (39.5, -81.5)) to transport coal from the mine to another location\n- Pickup position at (39.5, -82.5) and drop position at (39.5, -80.5)\n\n### Furnace at position (0, 0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace (position (0, 0)) with fuel source (coal) but no ingredients to smelt\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n* Errors when inserting coal into the burner-mining-drill:\n  - Make sure the drill's inventory is not full before inserting coal\n  - Empty the chest at the drop position to continue mining\n* Errors when extracting coal from the coal chest:\n  - Make sure the chest is not empty before extracting coal\n  - Check the quantity of coal to extract, it should not exceed the available amount in the chest\n* Errors when the furnace has no ingredients to smelt:\n  - Provide ingredients to the furnace to start smelting\n\n# NAMESPACE\n* Important variables:\n  - `coal_chest`: a chest to store coal\n  - `drill`: a burner-mining-drill to mine coal\n  - `inserter`: a burner-inserter to transport coal\n  - `furnace`: a stone-furnace to smelt coal\n* Utility functions:\n  - `insert_item`: inserts an item into an entity's inventory\n  - `extract_item`: extracts an item from an entity's inventory\n  - Failure modes:\n    - Inserting coal into a full inventory\n    - Extracting coal from an empty chest\n    - Smelting without ingredients in the furnace\n  - Success modes:\n    - Successfully inserting coal into the drill's inventory\n    - Successfully extracting coal from the coal chest\n    - Successfully smelting coal in the furnace"}
