{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\n- **Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (12 units)\n  - Status: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Produces iron plates (13 units currently)\n\n### Research Lab\n- **Lab** \n  - Input: Automation Science Pack (10 units)\n  - Status: No power\n\n### Water Pumping Station\n- **Offshore Pump** at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n  - Status: Not connected\n  - Connection points: [Position(x=-9.5, y=23.5)]\n  - Warnings: No fluid present in connections\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Attribute Access\n- Ensure that the attributes you are trying to access exist on the object. For example, `Prototype.Boiler.entity_class.tile_dimensions` resulted in an `AttributeError`. Verify that `tile_dimensions` is a valid attribute.\n\n### Type Errors with ModelPrivateAttr\n- Avoid using `ModelPrivateAttr` directly in arithmetic operations. Convert it to a compatible type before performing operations. For example, `boiler_box = BuildingBox(width=boiler_width + 4, height=boiler_height + 4)` resulted in a `TypeError`. Ensure conversion to `int` or `float` is done properly.\n\n### Conversion Errors\n- When converting attributes to `int` or `float`, ensure the attribute is a string or a real number. For instance, `boiler_width = float(boiler_width)` resulted in a `TypeError`. Validate the type before conversion.\n\n### Connection and Power Issues\n- Ensure all entities that require connections, such as the offshore pump, are properly connected to their respective systems. The offshore pump is not connected, leading to warnings about no fluid present.\n- Make sure that power-dependent entities, like the lab, are connected to a power source to avoid status issues like \"No power\"."}
