{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (61.0, -54.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (61.0, -54.0) fueled by coal, used for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (61.5, -52.5) containing coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (62.5, -53.5) containing coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (62.5, -52.5) containing coal.\n\n### Coal Mining and Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) fueled by coal, extracting coal from the resource patch.\n- Burner Inserter at position (41.5, -83.5) transferring coal from the mining drill to a wooden chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (40.5, -83.5) for temporary storage of extracted coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (42.5, -83.5) containing extracted coal.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors when inserting items without available inventory\n- Ensure that you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. For example, the exception at step 55 indicates a failure to insert coal due to lack of coal in the inventory.\n\n### Errors when entities are waiting for source items\n- Check that the source entities are producing or have items available for transfer. The burner inserter at position (41.5, -83.5) is waiting for source items, indicating a potential blockage or lack of items in the source entity.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- **Utility Functions Defined:**\n  - None specified in the logs.\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `inventory`: Dictionary representing the agent's current inventory, e.g., `{'wood': 6, 'iron-plate': 186}`.\n  - `furnace_inventory`: Dictionary representing the inventory of the stone furnace, e.g., `{'iron-ore': 7, 'iron-plate': 90}`.\n  - `coal_inventory`: Inventory of coal in various chests and entities, e.g., `{'coal': 271}` in the wooden chest at position (42.5, -83.5)."}
