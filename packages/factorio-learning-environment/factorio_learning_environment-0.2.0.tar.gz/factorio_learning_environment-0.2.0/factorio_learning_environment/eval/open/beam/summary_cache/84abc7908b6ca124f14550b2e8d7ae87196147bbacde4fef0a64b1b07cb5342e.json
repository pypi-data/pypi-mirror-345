{"content": "\"\"\"\nThe attempt to insert **Copper Ore** into the active furnace has failed due to an error indicating that there is **no Copper Ore available in the inventory**. This suggests that the Copper Ore was not retained during previous operations or was lost in the process.\n\n### Current Inventory Overview:\n- **Current Inventory**:\n  - 4 pieces of stone furnaces\n  - 7 pieces of coal remaining\n  - 5 pieces of iron ore\n  - 3 pieces of iron plates.\n\n### Observations:\n- The inventory does not currently contain any Copper Ore, which is essential for producing Copper Plates.\n- This situation requires immediate action to gather more Copper Ore to continue production.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Locate and Harvest Copper Ore**: I need to find a nearby Copper Ore deposit and gather more resources.\n2. **Reassess Operations**: Once I have sufficient Copper Ore, I can return to the furnace and begin smelting again.\n\nLet's proceed to locate a Copper Ore resource patch to gather more Copper Ore. \n\"\"\"\n\n# Find the nearest copper resource patch\ncopper_resource_position = nearest(Resource.CopperOre)\n\n# Move to the identified copper resource position\nmove_to(copper_resource_position)  # Navigate to the nearest Copper Ore resource location \n\n# Harvest the copper resource\nharvest_resource(nearest(Resource.CopperOre), quantity=5)  # Attempt to gather 5 pieces of Copper Ore \n\n# Check the overall inventory again after harvesting to confirm collected copper\noverall_inventory_after_copper_harvest = inspect_inventory()  # Check overall inventory post-harvest.\nprint(f\"Overall current inventory after harvesting copper: {overall_inventory_after_copper_harvest}\")  # Confirm total inventory after harvesting. \nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")  # Review entities available on the map.
