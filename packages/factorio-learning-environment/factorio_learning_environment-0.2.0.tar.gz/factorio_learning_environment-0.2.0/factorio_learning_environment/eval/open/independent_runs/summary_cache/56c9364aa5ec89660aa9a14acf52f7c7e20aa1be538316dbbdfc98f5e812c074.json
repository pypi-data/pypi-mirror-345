{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-29.5, 30.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position -29.5, 30.5) connected to offshore pump (position -10.5, 25.5) via pipes. The steam engine is currently not connected to a power network and has no input liquid.\n\n### Copper plate factory at position(-18.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace (position -18.0, -49.0) that is currently full output with 7 iron-ore and producing copper-plate.\n- Burner mining drill (position not specified) that is assumed to be extracting copper-ore.\n\n### Boiler at position(-24.5, -50.0)\nConsists of a boiler (position -24.5, -50.0) that is currently out of fuel.\n\n### Offshore pump at position(-10.5, 25.5)\nConsists of an offshore pump (position -10.5, 25.5) that is currently working and providing water.\n\n### Pipe groups\nConsists of multiple pipe groups that connect various entities for fluid transport, with one group being full output and others being empty.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when trying to insert items from inventory\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into a furnace or other entities. In this case, you attempted to insert iron-ore into the furnace but had none available.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
