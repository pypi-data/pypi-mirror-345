{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll summarize the structures and error tips:\n\n# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line at (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-15.0, -50.0) facing down, mining iron ore\n- Burner inserter at (-14.5, -48.5) transferring ore from drill to furnace\n- Stone furnace at (-14.0, -47.0) smelting iron plates\nAll components are fueled with coal and connected in a production line setup.\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with entity placement and spacing\n- When placing entities next to each other, ensure there is adequate spacing between them to avoid collision\n- Consider the entity dimensions and required spacing when placing connected structures\n- Use appropriate direction parameters when placing entities to ensure proper alignment\n\n### Errors with missing resources\n- Ensure required fuel (coal) is in inventory before attempting to insert it into machines\n- Check inventory for required items before attempting crafting operations\n- Make sure to harvest/collect required resources before attempting to use them\n\n### Errors with crafting requirements\n- Some items like iron plates cannot be crafted directly and require smelting in a furnace\n- Verify crafting requirements and methods before attempting to craft items\n- For items requiring smelting, ensure a proper smelting setup is in place first\n\n### Type errors in calculations\n- When calculating positions or dimensions, ensure proper data types are used\n- Avoid direct operations on model attributes that may have incompatible types\n\n### Entity placement optimization\n- Consider the direction and orientation of entities when building production lines\n- Ensure proper spacing between entities to allow for inserter operation\n- Clean up unused or misplaced entities to avoid blocking new placements"}
