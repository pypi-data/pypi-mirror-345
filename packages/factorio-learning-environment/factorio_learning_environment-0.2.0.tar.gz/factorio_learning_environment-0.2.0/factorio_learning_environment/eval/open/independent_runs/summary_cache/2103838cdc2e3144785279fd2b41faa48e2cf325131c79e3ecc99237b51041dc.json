Consider increasing spacing, changing direction, or altering the reference position if a placement fails due to an existing entity.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient inventory items\n- Always check your inventory for the required items before attempting to insert them into machines. Maintain a sufficient stock of necessary items like coal to avoid operational interruptions."}
