{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) which extracts iron ore and deposits it into the chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5) which stores iron ore extracted by the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5) which transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0) which processes iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Insufficient Fuel Management\n- Ensure that there is enough coal in the inventory to refuel all necessary entities such as mining drills, inserters, and furnaces. Plan fuel collection and distribution efficiently to prevent interruptions in production.\n\n### Furnace Production Issues\n- Regularly check the furnace for ingredients and ensure it is supplied with enough iron ore and fuel to maintain continuous production of iron plates. Avoid situations where the furnace has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Chest Management\n- Monitor the chest inventory to prevent it from becoming full. Extract items from the chest regularly to ensure the mining drill can continue depositing iron ore.\n\n### Inserter Alignment and Refueling\n- Verify that inserters are correctly aligned to transfer items between entities and are adequately refueled to maintain operational status."}
