{"content": "It appears that the variable `available_iron_ore_after` is not defined in the current context, which is causing the error. To resolve this, we need to redefine the available iron ore based on the most recent inventory check. Let's proceed with the following steps:\n\n### Step 1: Check the current inventory to determine the amount of iron ore available.\ncurrent_inventory = inspect_inventory()  # Inspect the player's current inventory.\navailable_iron_ore = current_inventory.get(Prototype.IronOre, 0)  # Get the available amount of iron ore.\nprint(f\"Available Iron Ore: {available_iron_ore}\")  # Log the available iron ore.\n\n### Step 2: Check the status of the furnaces again.\nentities_on_map = get_entities({Prototype.StoneFurnace})  # Fetch the current status of the furnaces.\n\n# Step 3: Insert the harvested iron ore into both furnaces to ensure they are running.\nfor furnace in entities_on_map:\n    if available_iron_ore > 0:\n        insert_amount = min(10, available_iron_ore)  # Determine how much to insert.\n        insert_item(Prototype.IronOre, furnace, quantity=insert_amount)  # Insert the calculated amount of iron ore.\n        available_iron_ore -= insert_amount  # Decrease the available iron ore after insertion.\n\n# Step 4: Verify the updated status of the furnaces after insertion.\nfor furnace in entities_on_map:\n    furnace_status = inspect_inventory(furnace)  # Get the inventory status of each furnace.\n    print(f\"Furnace Status after iron ore insertion: {furnace_status}\")  # Log the status for each furnace.\n\n# Step 5: Check if the furnaces have enough coal (fuel) to continue operating.\nfor furnace in entities_on_map:\n    furnace_fuel_status = inspect_inventory(furnace)  # Check the fuel status in each furnace.\n    print(f\"Fuel Status for Furnace: {furnace_fuel_status}\")  # Log fuel status for each furnace.\n\n# Step 6: Final inventory check for player resources.\nfinal_inventory = inspect_inventory()  # Inspect the player's inventory.\nprint(f\"Final Player Inventory: {final_inventory}\")  # Show the current inventory state after all actions.", "summary_range": "[1-336]"}
