{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0) with a drop position at (x=40.5, y=-83.5) connected to:\n  - Wooden Chest at position (x=40.5, y=-83.5) containing coal.\n  - Wooden Chest at position (x=41.5, y=-83.5) containing iron plates.\n  - Wooden Chest at position (x=42.5, y=-83.5) containing coal.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=1.5, y=0.5) connected to:\n  - Wooden Chest at position (x=2.5, y=0.5) which is empty.\n  - Transport Belt at position (x=4.5, y=0.5) to (x=6.5, y=0.5).\n\n### Copper Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=10.0, y=0.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=11.5, y=0.5) connected to:\n  - Wooden Chest at position (x=12.5, y=0.5) containing copper plates.\n\n### Iron and Copper Plate Storage\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=7.5, y=0.5) containing iron plates and copper plates.\n\n### Transport Belt System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- BeltGroup connecting various positions, including:\n  - Belt from (x=3.5, y=0.5) to (x=5.5, y=0.5) and (x=4.5, y=0.5) to (x=6.5, y=0.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Missing Entities\n- Ensure that the entity you are trying to interact with exists at the specified position. For example, attempting to interact with a wooden chest at a location where it does not exist will result in an error.\n\n### Errors with Inserters and Chests\n- Ensure that there is a valid target for inserters to supply items. If an inserter cannot find a nearby entity that can accept the items, it will result in an error.\n\n### Errors with Blocked Transport Belts\n- Regularly clear blockages on transport belts to ensure smooth operation. Attempting to extract items from a blocked belt without clearing it first will result in an error.\n\n### Errors with Full Chests\n- Monitor the inventory of chests to prevent them from becoming full, which can halt production processes. Empty chests at drop positions to continue mining and production operations."}
