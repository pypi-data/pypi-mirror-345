{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Coal Mine at Position (41.0, -86.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (41.0, -86.0) and **Burner Mining Drill** at position (43.0, -86.0)\n- **Transport Belt** at position (41.5, -84.5)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (43.5, -84.5) and **Wooden Chest** at position (41.5, -82.5)\n\n#### Iron Ore Mine at Position (-17.0, -52.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-17.0, -52.0)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-16.5, -50.5)\n\n#### Furnace Setup at Position (43.0, -79.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (43.0, -79.0)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (43.5, -76.5)\n\n#### Furnace Setup at Position (-15.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-15.0, -51.0)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-13.5, -51.5)\n\n#### Furnace Setup at Position (-13.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-13.0, -50.0)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when mining due to blocked transport belts or full chests\n- **Issue**: The burner mining drills at positions (41.0, -86.0) and (-17.0, -52.0) are either blocked by a transport belt or have a full chest at the drop position.\n- **Solution**: Clear the transport belt at (41.5, -84.5) and empty the chests at (43.5, -84.5) and (-16.5, -50.5) to allow continuous mining.\n\n#### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- **Issue**: The agent attempted to place entities on tiles that were already occupied.\n- **Solution**: Ensure the target tile is empty before placing any entity.\n\n#### Errors when extracting items from chests\n- **Issue**: The agent extracted items from chests multiple times without checking if the chests were empty or if the inventory was full.\n- **Solution**: Check the inventory and chest contents before extracting items to avoid unnecessary operations.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n#### Utility Functions\n- **extract_from_chest(chest_position: Position, item: str, count: int)**: Extracts a specified number of items from a chest at a given position.\n  - **Success**: Items are successfully extracted from the chest.\n  - **Failure**: Chest is empty or inventory is full.\n\n- **restart_furnace(furnace_position: Position)**: Restarts a furnace at a given position.\n  - **Success**: Furnace is successfully restarted.\n  - **Failure**: Furnace is already running or out of fuel.\n\n#### Important Variables\n- **coal**: int - Represents the amount of coal in the inventory.\n- **iron_ore**: int - Represents the amount of iron ore in the inventory.\n- **iron_plate**: int - Represents the amount of iron plates in the inventory."}
