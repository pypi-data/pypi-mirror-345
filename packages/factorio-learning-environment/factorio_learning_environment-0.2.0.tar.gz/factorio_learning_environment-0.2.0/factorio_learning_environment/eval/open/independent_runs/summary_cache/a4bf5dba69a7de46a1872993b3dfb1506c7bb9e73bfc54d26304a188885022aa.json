{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Transport System at Position (-23.0, -68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) which is working and dropping coal at position (-23.5, -69.5).\n- Belt group starting at position (-23.5, -69.5) and extending through positions (-22.5, -69.5), (-21.5, -69.5), (-21.5, -68.5), (-21.5, -67.5), and (-21.5, -66.5) for transporting mined coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-24.5, -67.5) for storage.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-20.5, -66.5) waiting for source items, indicating a connection to a furnace or another processing unit.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) which is working.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -54.5) for storage.\n\n### Copper Ore Processing at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with no ingredients.\n- Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5) for storage.\n- Burner Inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) waiting for source items.\n- Wooden Chest at position (3.5, 0.5) for additional storage.\n\n### Additional Structures\n- Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5) and Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) working, indicating another mining operation.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Belt Placement\n- Ensure that the target position for placing a transport belt is unoccupied before attempting to place it. Remove any existing entities at the target position to avoid placement errors.\n\n### Errors with Connecting Belts\n- Verify that the entities you are trying to connect with belts are compatible and within the correct range. Ensure the belt path is clear and correctly aligned to avoid connection errors.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Check that the inserters have access to the necessary source items. Ensure that the supply chain feeding the inserters is intact and operational to prevent them from idling."}
