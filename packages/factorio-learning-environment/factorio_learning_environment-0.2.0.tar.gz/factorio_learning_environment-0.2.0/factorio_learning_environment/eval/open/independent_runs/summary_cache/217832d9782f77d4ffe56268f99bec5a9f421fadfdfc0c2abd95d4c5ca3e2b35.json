{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=1.5, y=23.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Steam Engine** at position (x=17.5, y=20.5) with status NOT_CONNECTED, warnings of 'no input liquid' and 'no fluid present in connections'.\n- **Boiler** at position (x=1.5, y=23.0) with status NO_FUEL, warnings of 'out of fuel'.\n- **Offshore Pump** at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5) with status WORKING, supplying water to the system.\n\n### Pipe Network\n- **PipeGroup** (fluid_system=59772) starting at position (x=3.5, y=17.5), status EMPTY, connecting various positions.\n- **PipeGroup** (fluid_system=59783) with fluid 'water', starting at position (x=-9.5, y=23.5), status FULL_OUTPUT, connecting various positions.\n\n### Electricity Network\n- **ElectricityGroup** (id=167775) with poles at various positions including (x=21.5, y=27.5), (x=27.5, y=26.5), (x=7.5, y=8.5), and others, currently with voltage 0.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure that the pipes and underground pipes are correctly aligned and connected between the boiler output and steam engine input. Verify that there are no gaps or misalignments in the pipe network.\n\n### Errors with Boiler Fueling\n- Regularly check and refuel the boiler to maintain its operation and prevent the 'out of fuel' warning. Ensure a steady supply of fuel to avoid interruptions in the electricity generation process."}
