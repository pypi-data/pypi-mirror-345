{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Storage System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest at position (40.5, -83.5) containing coal (750 units).\n- Wooden chest at position (38.5, -84.5) containing coal (800 units).\n- Wooden chest at position (39.5, -84.5) containing coal (800 units).\n- Wooden chest at position (44.5, -83.5) containing coal (650 units) and iron plates (250 units).\n\n### Coal Mining and Transport System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) fueled with coal (19 units), extracting coal and dropping it at position (40.5, -83.5). \n- Transport belts connecting various positions to facilitate coal movement:\n  - BeltGroup with inputs at (45.5, -82.5) and outputs at (48.5, -79.5).\n  - BeltGroup with inputs at (43.5, -80.5) and outputs at (63.5, -50.5).\n  - BeltGroup with inputs at (42.5, -81.5) and outputs at (65.5, -46.5).\n  - BeltGroup with inputs at (44.5, -81.5) and outputs at (65.5, -54.5).\n  - BeltGroup with inputs at (49.5, -80.5) and outputs at (60.5, -69.5).\n  - BeltGroup with inputs at (49.5, -78.5) and outputs at (58.5, -69.5).\n  - BeltGroup with inputs at (50.5, -79.5) and outputs at (59.5, -70.5).\n  - BeltGroup with inputs at (59.5, -68.5) and outputs at (67.5, -54.5).\n\n### Stone Furnace Operation\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (61.0, -54.0) fueled with coal (6 units), currently not smelting due to lack of ingredients.\n- Burner Inserter at position (62.5, -53.5) fueled with coal (24 units), waiting for source items to transfer to the stone furnace.\n- Wooden chest at position (61.5, -52.5) containing stone bricks (10 units), wood (6 units), coal (650 units), and stone (5 units).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inventory Management\n- Ensure there is enough space in the inventory before attempting to extract or drop items. Consider crafting additional storage chests if inventory space is consistently an issue.\n\n### Errors with Chest Storage\n- Before inserting items into a chest, verify that the chest has enough available space. Attempting to insert more items than a chest can hold will result in failure.\n- Regularly monitor and manage chest inventories to prevent them from becoming full, which can block further operations.\n\n### Errors with Entity Placement\n- Ensure that the required items are available in the inventory before attempting to place entities like wooden chests. Attempting to place an entity without having it in the inventory will result in failure.\n\n### Errors with Fuel Management\n- Regularly refuel entities like burner mining drills and burner inserters to prevent them from running out of fuel and halting operations.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- None defined or invoked in the provided logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `current_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the current inventory of the agent.\n- `output_chest_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the inventory of the output chest.\n- `new_storage_chest_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the inventory of newly placed storage chests."}
