{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-10.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-10.0, -50.0) with a warning of \"no ingredients to smelt\".\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-10.5, -48.5) directed towards the furnace, currently out of fuel and waiting for source items.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-8.5, -49.5) containing iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-7.5, -49.5) directed towards the chest, with warnings of being out of fuel and output blocked by an item on the ground.\n\n### Belt Network\nConsists of multiple interconnected belt groups:\n- **BeltGroup 1**: Inputs from (x=-15.5, y=-54.5) to (x=-13.5, y=-54.5) and outputs from (x=-12.5, y=-54.5) to (x=-10.5, y=-54.5).\n- **BeltGroup 2**: Inputs from (x=-21.5, y=-51.5) to (x=-19.5, y=-51.5) and outputs from (x=-15.5, y=-51.5) to (x=-15.5, y=-53.5).\n- **BeltGroup 3**: Inputs from (x=-14.5, y=-50.5) to (x=-16.5, y=-50.5) and outputs from (x=-16.5, y=-55.5) to (x=-14.5, y=-55.5).\n- **BeltGroup 4**: Inputs from (x=-9.5, y=-50.5) to (x=-9.5, y=-52.5) and outputs from (x=-9.5, y=-53.5) to (x=-9.5, y=-55.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Extracting Items from Containers\n- Ensure that the target container exists and contains the item you want to extract. Verify the entity's presence and its inventory before attempting extraction.\n\n### Errors with Inserters\n- Make sure inserters have a clear path to their destination and are properly fueled. Check for any obstructions or lack of destination space that might block their operation.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Issues\n- Investigate the supply chain to ensure that all necessary ingredients are available for the furnace. Check the connectivity and functionality of inserters and belts to ensure smooth material flow."}
