{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-9.5, 24.5)\nThis structure is intended to generate electricity but is currently not fully operational due to connectivity issues. It consists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5) - Status: Working\n- Boiler at position (-2.5, 24.0) - Status: No Fuel\n- Steam Engine at position (-5.5, 19.5) - Status: Not Connected\n- Pipe Group at position (-8.5, 23.5) - Status: Full Output\n- Pipe Group at position (-5.5, 16.5) - Status: Empty\n- Electricity Group at position (-5.4, 20.0) - Status: Not Plugged in Electric Network\n\n### Stone Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Stone Furnace - Status: No Ingredients\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Connection Errors Between Entities\n- Ensure that all necessary pipes are correctly placed and connected between the Offshore Pump, Boiler, and Steam Engine. Verify the alignment and connectivity of pipes to avoid failures in establishing connections.\n\n### Fuel Management for Boilers\n- Make sure to keep the Boiler supplied with fuel (e.g., coal) to ensure it can operate effectively. Regularly check the fuel status and replenish as needed.\n\n### Inventory Management for Construction\n- Before attempting to place new entities, verify that the required items are available in the inventory. For instance, ensure small electric poles are available before attempting to place them.\n\n### Electric Network Connectivity\n- Ensure that the electricity group is properly connected to the electric network. Check the placement of electric poles and their connections to ensure the network is complete and functional.\n\n### Handling Index Errors\n- When accessing lists or arrays, ensure that the index used is within the valid range to prevent \"IndexError: list index out of range\" errors. Validate the existence of elements before accessing them."}
