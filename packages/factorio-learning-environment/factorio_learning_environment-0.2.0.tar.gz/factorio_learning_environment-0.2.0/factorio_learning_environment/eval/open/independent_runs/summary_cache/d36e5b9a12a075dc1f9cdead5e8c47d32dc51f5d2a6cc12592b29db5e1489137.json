{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Transfer Setup at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) storing iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -48.5) transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Alignment Errors\n- Ensure that the inserter's pickup position aligns with the chest's position. Misalignment can prevent the inserter from picking up items correctly.\n\n### Placement Errors Due to Collisions\n- Before placing an entity, check for potential collisions with existing entities. Consider adjusting the spacing, direction, or reference position to avoid placement errors.\n\n### Fuel Shortage for Mining Drill\n- Maintain a sufficient supply of fuel, such as coal, in your inventory to refuel mining drills and inserters to prevent operational interruptions.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Ingredients\n- Verify the setup of inserters and ensure they are correctly transferring materials to the furnace. Check for any misalignments or blockages that might prevent the transfer of iron ore to the furnace."}
