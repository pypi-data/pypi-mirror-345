{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 19.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (-5.5, 19.5)\n- Boiler at position (-2.5, 24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe Group at positions (-5.5, 16.5) and (-8.5, 23.5)\n- Small Electric Poles at positions (-8.5, 16.5), (-6.5, 16.5), (-1.5, 16.5), (0.5, 16.5), (0.5, 21.5), (0.5, 24.5), (-5.5, 25.5), and (-7.5, 15.5)\n\n### Copper Plate Production at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Using Extracting but Being Too Far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when Placing into a Tile Which is Occupied by Another Entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Insufficient Inventory for Crafting\n- Ensure you have all required materials in your inventory before attempting to craft items. For example, ensure you have enough copper plates to craft copper cables, which are needed for small electric poles.\n\n### Failed to Insert Items Due to Lack of Inventory\n- Verify that you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into structures, such as coal for the boiler.\n\n### Failed to Place Small Electric Pole Due to Overlapping Water\n- Avoid placing entities where the footprint overlaps with water. Choose a different location that is clear of obstacles."}
