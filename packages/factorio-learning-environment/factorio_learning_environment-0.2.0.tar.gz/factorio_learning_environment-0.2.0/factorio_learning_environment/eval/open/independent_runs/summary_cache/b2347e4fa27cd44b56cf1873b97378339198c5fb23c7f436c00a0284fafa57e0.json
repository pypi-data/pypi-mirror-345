{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-18.5, 19.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position -18.5, 19.5), boiler (position -13.5, 20.0), and offshore pump (position -11.5, 26.5). The steam engine generates electricity using steam produced by the boiler, which is powered by water from the offshore pump.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(5.0, -73.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 5.0, -73.0) and a furnace (position 5.0, -73.0).\n\n### Copper cable factory at position(-21.5, 25.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine (position -21.5, 25.5) and inserter that puts into the assembling machine.\n- Beltgroup that connects the furnace at position -18.0, -49.0 to the assembling machine at position -21.5, 25.5.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting pipes\n- Ensure that the positions of the entities you are trying to connect are within a valid range and that there are no obstacles in between. Check the coordinates and ensure they are aligned properly.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing. Check for existing entities in the target position."}
