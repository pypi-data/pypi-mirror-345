{"content": "Ah, I now understand the fundamental issue - we can't craft these items directly because they require a crafting/smelting machine. We need to:\n\n1. Check our inventory first to see what we have available\n2. Use existing items rather than trying to craft new ones\n\nLet's modify our approach:\n\n```python\n# First check our inventory\ncurrent_inventory = inspect_inventory()\nprint(f\"Current inventory: {current_inventory}\")\n\n# Move to the drill position\nmove_to(Position(19.0, -17.0))\nprint(\"Moved to drill position\")\n\n# Get our drill reference and note its drop position\ndrill = get_entities({Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill})[0]\ndrop_pos = drill.drop_position\nprint(f\"Working with drill at {drill.position}, drops at {drop_pos}\")\n\n# Calculate proper positions for inserter and furnace\ninserter_pos = Position(x=drop_pos.x, y=drop_pos.y)\nfurnace_pos = Position(x=drop_pos.x + 2, y=drop_pos.y)  # 2 tiles right of drop position\n\n# Try to place furnace first (if we have one)\nif 'stone-furnace' in current_inventory:\n    furnace = place_entity(\n        Prototype.StoneFurnace,\n        position=furnace_pos\n    )\n    print(f\"Placed furnace at {furnace.position}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No stone furnace available in inventory\")\n\n# Try to place inserter (if we have one)\nif 'burner-inserter' in current_inventory:\n    inserter = place_entity(\n        Prototype.BurnerInserter,\n        position=inserter_pos\n    )\n    rotate_entity(inserter, Direction.RIGHT)\n    print(f\"Placed and rotated inserter at {inserter.position}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No burner inserter available in inventory\")\n\n# Check if we have coal for fuel\nif 'coal' in current_inventory:\n    # Add fuel to all machines if we successfully placed them\n    if 'furnace' in locals():\n        insert_item(Prototype.Coal, furnace, quantity=5)\n    if 'inserter' in locals():\n        insert_item(Prototype.Coal, inserter, quantity=1)\n    insert_item(Prototype.Coal, drill, quantity=5)\n    print(\"Added fuel to machines\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No coal available for fuel\")\n\n# Let system work\nprint(\"Waiting for system to process ore...\")\nsleep(10)\n\n# Check final status\nprint(f\"Final status:\")\nprint(f\"Drill status: {drill.status}\")\nif 'inserter' in locals():\n    print(f\"Inserter status: {inserter.status}\")\nif 'furnace' in locals():\n    print(f\"Furnace status: {furnace.status}\")\n    print(f\"Furnace inventory: {inspect_inventory(furnace)}\")\n```\n\nThis approach:\n1. Checks what we actually have in inventory first\n2. Only attempts to place items we have available\n3. Provides better error handling and status reporting\n4. Uses proper positioning relative to the drill's drop position\n\nLet's see what we actually have available to work with.", "summary_range": "[1-3376]"}
