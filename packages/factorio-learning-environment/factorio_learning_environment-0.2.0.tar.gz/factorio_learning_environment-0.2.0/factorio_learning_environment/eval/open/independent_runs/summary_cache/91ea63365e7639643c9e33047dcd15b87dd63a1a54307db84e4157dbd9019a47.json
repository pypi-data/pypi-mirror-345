This error occurred when attempting to use a 'Chest' object as a callable in the pickup_entity function. Double-check the object types and their intended usage.\n\n### Errors when Using Extracting but Being Too Far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when Placing into a Tile Which is Occupied by Another Entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
