{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES  \n\n#### Coal Mining Operation at (x=16.0, y=0.0) and (x=18.0, y=0.0)  \nConsists of the following entities:  \n- **Burner mining drill** at (x=16.0, y=0.0) with a **wooden chest** at (x=16.5, y=1.5) for coal storage.  \n- **Burner mining drill** at (x=18.0, y=0.0) with a **wooden chest** at (x=18.5, y=1.5) for coal storage.  \n\n#### Coal Collection System  \n- **Main collection chest** at (x=17.5, y=3.5).  \n- **Inserters** at (x=16.5, y=2.5) and (x=18.5, y=2.5) to transfer coal from mining chests.  \n- **Manual transfer inserter** at (x=17.5, y=2.5).  \n\n### ERROR TIPS  \n\n#### Belt Connection Errors  \n- **Transport belts cannot connect directly to wooden chests**  \n  - Always use an inserter to bridge between chests and belts.  \n  - Example: Failed attempts to connect belts at (16.5, 1.5) and (17.5, 2.5).  \n\n#### Placement Collisions  \n- **Entities blocking transport belt placement**  \n  - Avoid placing belts where chests or inserters already exist (e.g., (16.5, 1.5)).  \n  - Clear obstructing entities first or choose alternate paths.  \n\n#### Inserter Placement Issues  \n- **Repeated failed inserter placement at (16.5, 0.5)**  \n  - The position is blocked by the mining drill at (16.0, 0.0).  \n  - Place inserters adjacent to chests, not drills.  \n\n#### General Tips  \n- **Verify belt paths before placement** to avoid invalid connections.  \n- **Use inserters for all chest-to-belt transfers**\u2014direct connections are unsupported.  \n- **Check entity spacing** to prevent collisions during placement.  \n\n(No **NAMESPACE** section as no custom functions were defined.)"}
