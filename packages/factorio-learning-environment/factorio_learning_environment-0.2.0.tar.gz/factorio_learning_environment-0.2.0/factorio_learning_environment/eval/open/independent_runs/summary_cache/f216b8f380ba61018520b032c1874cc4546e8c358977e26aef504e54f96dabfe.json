In this case, 'Entity' and 'Furnace' were not recognized.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place a entity to a tile before attempting placing. Consider increasing the spacing, changing the direction or changing the reference position.\n\n### IndexError: list index out of range\n- Before accessing an element of a list using an index, ensure that the list is not empty and that the index is within the valid range. This error occurred when trying to access the first element of a list of labs, but no labs existed.\n\n### Exception: Could not place lab at (0.0, 0.0), No lab in inventory\n- Before placing an entity, ensure that the entity is present in the agent's inventory.\n\n# NAMESPACE\n\n### Functions:\n- `check_furnace_fuel_levels(furnace: Furnace) -> bool`:\n  - Failure: `NameError: name 'Furnace' is not defined` because the type `Furnace` was not imported or defined.\n\n### Variables:\n- No variables assigned yet.\n```"}
