{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll generate a comprehensive report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing Line (around x=41, y=-80)\nComplex production line consisting of:\n- Burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0) mining coal\n- Wooden chest at (41.5, -80.5) collecting coal\n- Output inserter at (42.5, -80.5) moving coal from chest to belt\n- Belt system from (43.5, -80.5) to (44.5, -80.5) transporting coal\n- Furnace inserter at (45.5, -80.5) moving items from belt to furnace\n- Stone furnace at (47.0, -80.0) for smelting\n\nCurrent operational status:\n- Mining drill is working with coal fuel\n- Chest contains 156 coal\n- Output inserter waiting for belt space\n- Belt system contains 7 coal\n- Furnace inserter waiting for items\n- Furnace has no ingredients but has coal fuel\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Collision Errors\n- Before placing entities, check for and clear any items-on-ground at the target position\n- When placing entities next to each other, ensure proper spacing and check for existing entity collisions\n- Consider using the buildable area check before placing structures (as seen in step 379)\n\n### Entity State Verification\n- Always verify entity existence before attempting operations (as seen in step 382 where furnace wasn't found)\n- Check entity states and connections after placement to ensure proper setup\n\n### Belt System Management\n- Clear belt blockages before attempting to rebuild or modify belt systems\n- Verify belt connections and directions after placement\n- Ensure proper alignment between belts and inserters\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nFunctions:\n- place_entity_next_to(entity_type, reference_position, spacing, direction): Places entity relative to reference position\n  Success: When placement area is clear\n  Failure: When collision with existing entities or items-on-ground\n\nImportant Variables:\n- Belt positions: (43.5, -80.5), (44.5, -80.5)\n- Inserter positions: (42.5, -80.5), (45.5, -80.5)\n- Furnace position: (47.0, -80.0)\n- Drill position: (41.0, -82.0)\n- Chest position: (41.5, -80.5)"}
