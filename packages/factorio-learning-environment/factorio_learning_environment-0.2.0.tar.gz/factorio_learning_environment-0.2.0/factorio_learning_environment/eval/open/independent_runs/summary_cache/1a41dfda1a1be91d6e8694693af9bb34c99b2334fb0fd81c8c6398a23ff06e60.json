Crafting Readiness:\n\u2003\u2013 Confirm availability of all required items\u2014including raw resources like stone\u2014to meet crafting prerequisites before initiating build actions.\n\u2003\u2013 Track inventory levels closely to avoid crafting failures such as the inability to craft stone furnaces due to missing raw stone.\n\n\u2022 Placement Obstructions:\n\u2003\u2013 Verify target build positions are unobstructed and clear of non-removable entities before attempting placement.\n\u2003\u2013 When placement fails because of an existing object (for example, a PipeGroup blocking (x=-17.0, y=22.0)), consider alternative locations or pre-clearance strategies.\n\n\u2022 Buildable Position Determination:\n\u2003\u2013 Ensure alternate candidate positions are validated with robust buildability checks.\n\u2003\u2013 Reassess spatial clearance methods if repeated alternate positions are found unbuildable.\n\n\u2022 Clearing Blocking Entities:\n\u2003\u2013 Recognize that certain network elements (e.g. persistent PipeGroups) may be non-removable; plan the layout accordingly to avoid conflicts in critical build areas."}
