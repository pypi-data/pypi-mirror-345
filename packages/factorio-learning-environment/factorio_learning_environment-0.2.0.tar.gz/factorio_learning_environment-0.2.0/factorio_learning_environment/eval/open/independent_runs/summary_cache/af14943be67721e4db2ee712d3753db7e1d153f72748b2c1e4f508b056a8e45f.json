Consider adjusting the position or removing the obstructing object.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient inventory\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to place or refuel entities. Craft or harvest necessary items beforehand.\n\n### Errors when extracting or managing resources\n- Ensure that the target storage has enough resources to extract and that there is sufficient space in the destination storage to avoid blockages.\n\n### Errors related to inserter operations\n- Ensure that inserters have a clear path to drop items and that the destination is not blocked. Adjust the position or clear blockages as necessary.\n\n### Errors due to lack of fuel\n- Regularly check and refuel entities like Burner Mining Drills and Burner Inserters to maintain continuous operation."}
