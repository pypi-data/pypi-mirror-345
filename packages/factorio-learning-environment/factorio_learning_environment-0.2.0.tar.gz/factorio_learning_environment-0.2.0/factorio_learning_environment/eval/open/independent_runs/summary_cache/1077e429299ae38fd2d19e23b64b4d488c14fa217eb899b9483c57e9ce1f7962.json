{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore pump at position (-47.5, -123.5)\n- Boiler at position (-46.5, -121.0)\n- Steam engine at position (-41.5, -117.5)\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace at position (-19.0, -73.0) for copper plate production\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace at position (9.0, -64.0) for iron plate production\n- Stone furnace at position (6.0, -62.0) for additional iron plate production\n\n### Inserter and Storage System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) connected to a wooden chest at position (6.5, -59.5)\n- Wooden chest at position (7.5, -61.5)\n\n### Lab\n- Lab with input for automation science pack at position (not specified)\n\n### Pipe Networks\nMultiple pipe groups exist, each with different fluid systems and positions:\n- PipeGroup at position (-0.5, 10.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (-0.5, 17.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (-12.5, 23.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (-5.5, 24.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (1.5, 24.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (2.5, 25.5)\n\n### Electricity Network\n- Electricity group with poles at various positions, including (7.5, -39.5), (26.5, -38.5), (1.5, -36.5), etc.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Pipe Connections\n- Ensure pipes are placed correctly at the specified positions to connect the offshore pump to the boiler. The absence of pipes at positions such as (-47.5, -122.5) and (-46.5, -121.5) indicates a misplacement or missing pipes.\n\n### Boiler Connection Errors\n- Verify that the boiler is connected to the water source. The repeated assertion errors indicate that the boiler is not receiving water, which is crucial for its operation.\n\n### Inserter Power Supply Issues\n- Ensure that inserters are connected to a power source. The inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) is not receiving electricity, which prevents it from functioning.\n\n### Furnace Ingredient Warnings\n- Check that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. The stone furnaces at positions (-19.0, -73.0), (9.0, -64.0), and (6.0, -62.0) are lacking ingredients, preventing them from producing plates.\n\n### Lab Power Supply Issues\n- Ensure that the lab is connected to a power source to process science packs. The lab is currently not receiving power, which halts research progress."}
