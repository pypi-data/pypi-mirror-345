Belt links targeting a Stone Furnace (Step 200), a Wooden Chest (Step 205), or a Steam Engine (Step 207) must instead be interfaced via an inserter intermediary.\n  \n\u2022 Inserter Placement and Spacing:\n  - Ensure adequate clearance around furnaces and chests when placing inserters. Conflicts (as in Step 201) may occur if pre\u2010existing pipes or small-electric poles obstruct the intended placement.\n  - Adjust spacing and placement direction to avoid interference; errors were observed when default spacing (e.g., spacing 0) resulted in conflicts.\n\n\u2022 Variable and API Reference:\n  - Verify that all variable references (e.g., for extraction inserters and drop positions) are properly defined before use. Several NameErrors arose from undefined variables during retrieval of pickup/drop coordinates and inventories.\n\n\u2022 Path and Waypoint Validation:\n  - Precompute and confirm intermediate waypoints for belt connections to ensure that the selected paths are free from obstructions. Manually updated waypoints must be revalidated to prevent connection errors."}
