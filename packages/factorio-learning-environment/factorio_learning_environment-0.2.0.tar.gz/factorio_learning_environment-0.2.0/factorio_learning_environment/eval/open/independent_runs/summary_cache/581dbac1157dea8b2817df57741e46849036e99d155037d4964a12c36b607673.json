{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report: Steps 0-23\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation Setup (Water -> Steam -> Power)\n*   **Offshore Pump** at position (x=-9.5, y=-0.5) extracts water. Status: `EntityStatus.WORKING`.\n*   **Boiler** at position (x=-2.0, y=4.5) heats water using coal. Manually fueled in step 21. Status: `EntityStatus.WORKING`.\n*   **Steam Engine** at position (x=2.5, y=4.5) consumes steam to generate power. Status: `EntityStatus.WORKING`.\n*   **Pipe Network 1** (Fluid: water) connects the Offshore Pump to the Boiler. Consists of multiple pipes including segments near (x=-8.5, y=-0.5) and (x=-2.5, y=2.5). Status: `EntityStatus.WORKING`.\n*   **Pipe Network 2** (Fluid: steam) connects the Boiler output to the Steam Engine input. Consists of multiple pipes including segments near (x=-0.5, y=4.5) and (x=0.5, y=2.5). Status: `EntityStatus.WORKING`.\n*   **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-1.5, y=6.5) is intended to fuel the Boiler from a belt at (x=-1.5, y=7.5). Status: `EntityStatus.WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION` (Warning: output blocked).\n*   **Electricity Group** (ID 125392) distributes power from the Steam Engine via Small Electric Poles, connecting various structures including the Iron Ore mine.\n\n### Automated Coal Mining and Delivery\n*   **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=16.0, y=0.0) mines coal. Status: `EntityStatus.WORKING`.\n*   **Wooden Chest** at position (x=16.5, y=1.5) receives coal from the drill.\n*   **Burner Inserter** at position (x=17.5, y=2.5) moves coal from the chest to a transport belt. Status: `EntityStatus.WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS`.\n*   **Transport Belt Network:** Attempts were made (Steps 16-21) to build a belt line from the coal output chest inserter (x=16.5, y=2.5) to the boiler fuel inserter pickup point (x=-1.5, y=7.5). Several belts were placed and removed. The current setup includes:\n    *   A belt group starting at"}
