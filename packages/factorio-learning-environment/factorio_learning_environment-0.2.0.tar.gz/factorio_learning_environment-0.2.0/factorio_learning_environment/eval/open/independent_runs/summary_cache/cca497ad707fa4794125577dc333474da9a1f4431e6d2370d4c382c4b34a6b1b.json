{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-11.5, 18.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position -11.5, 18.5), boiler (position -11.5, 25.0), and offshore pump (position -9.5, 24.5). The steam engine is not connected to the power network and has no input liquid, while the boiler is out of fuel.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace (position 0.0, 0.0) that is currently working and has coal as fuel. \n\n### Lab at position(x)\nConsists of a lab (status: no power) that is set to research automation. It requires 10 iron gear wheels, 10 electronic circuits, and 4 transport belts to craft.\n\n### PipeGroup at position(-13.5, 15.5)\nConsists of a fluid system (water) with multiple pipes connecting various entities, currently full output.\n\n### ElectricityGroup at position(x)\nConsists of multiple small electric poles providing power to nearby entities.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items into the furnace\n- Ensure you have the required fuel (coal) in your inventory before attempting to insert it into the furnace. \n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing. \n\n### Errors related to lab crafting requirements\n- Check the inventory for required items (iron gear wheels, electronic circuits, transport belts) before attempting to craft the lab."}
