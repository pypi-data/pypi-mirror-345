{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Coal Mining Setup at Position (42.0, -83.0)\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (42.0, -83.0): Mines coal from the resource patch.\n- **Transport Belt** at position (42.5, -81.5): Moves coal from the drill to the chest.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (42.5, -80.5): Transfers coal from the belt to the chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (42.5, -79.5): Stores coal produced by the drill.\n\n#### Second Coal Mining Setup at Position (45.0, -83.0)\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (45.0, -83.0): Mines coal from the resource patch.\n- **Transport Belt** at position (45.5, -81.5): Moves coal from the drill to the chest.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (45.5, -80.5): Transfers coal from the belt to the chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (45.5, -79.5): Stores coal produced by the drill.\n\n#### Iron Smelting Setup at Position (4.0, -60.0)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (4.0, -60.0): Smelts iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (6.0, -60.0): Smelts iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (8.0, -60.0): Smelts iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (10.5, -59.5): Intended to store iron plates, but currently empty.\n\n#### Inserter Setup at Position (4.5, -57.5)\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (4.5, -57.5): Transfers items between entities.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (4.5, -56.5): Transfers items between entities.\n\n---\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### 1. **Incorrect Placement of Inserters**\n- **Error**: Attempting to place inserters next to furnaces without sufficient spacing or in occupied positions.\n- **Solution**: Increase the spacing or change the direction when placing inserters next to existing entities. Ensure the target position is free before placing.\n\n#### 2. **Missing Items in Inventory**\n- **Error**: Attempting to insert coal or iron ore into furnaces or inserters without the required items in the inventory.\n- **Solution**: Ensure the required items (e.g., coal, iron ore) are available in the inventory before attempting to insert them.\n\n#### 3. **Entity Placement Conflicts**\n- **Error**: Attempting to place entities (e.g., inserters) where existing entities (e.g., furnaces) are in the way.\n- **Solution**: Remove or relocate the existing entity before placing new ones. Use the `remove_entity` function if necessary.\n\n#### 4. **Fuel Management**\n- **Error**: Furnace fuel source is full, but no ingredients are available for smelting.\n- **Solution**: Ensure the furnace has both fuel and ingredients to operate. Clear the furnace's inventory if it is full of fuel but lacks ingredients.\n\n#### 5. **API Usage Errors**\n- **Error**: Incorrect usage of the `place_entity_next_to` API, leading to placement errors.\n- **Solution**: Refer to the API documentation to ensure correct usage of functions and parameters. Define and initialize all variables before using them.\n\n#### 6. **Inventory Full Errors**\n- **Error**: Attempting to insert items into a furnace or chest when the inventory is full.\n- **Solution**: Ensure the target inventory has space before inserting items. Clear the inventory if necessary.\n\n#### 7. **Output Blocking**\n- **Error**: Burner mining drill output is blocked due to no transport belt or chest to collect the output.\n- **Solution**: Place a transport belt and chest to collect the output from the mining drill. Ensure the transport belt connects the drill to the chest.\n\n#### 8. **Crafting Errors**\n- **Error**: Attempting to craft items without the required ingredients (e.g., stone for stone furnaces).\n- **Solution**: Ensure all required ingredients are available in the inventory before crafting. Harvest raw resources if necessary.\n\n#### 9. **Undefined Variables**\n- **Error**: Attempting to access an undefined variable (e.g., `chest_coal`).\n- **Solution**: Define and initialize all variables before using them. Ensure variables are correctly named and referenced.\n\n#### 10. **Distance Errors**\n- **Error**: Attempting to place entities (e.g., transport belts, furnaces) too far from the player's current position.\n- **"}
