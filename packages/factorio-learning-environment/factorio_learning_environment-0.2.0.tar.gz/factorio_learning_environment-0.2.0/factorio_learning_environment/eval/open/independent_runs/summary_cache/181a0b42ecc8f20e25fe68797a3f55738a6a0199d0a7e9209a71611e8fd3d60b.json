{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Furnace at position (1.0, 1.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace (position (1.0, 1.0)) with current status: EntityStatus.WORKING\n- Fuel inventory: 8 coal\n- Input inventory: 2 iron ore\n- Output inventory: 28 iron plates\n\n### Wooden chest at position (3.5, 1.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest (position (3.5, 1.5)) with inventory: {'iron-plate': 100}\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing an entity too far away\n- Ensure to move closer to the target position before attempting to place an entity. The maximum distance for placing entities is 10 units.\n\n### Errors when crafting items without required ingredients\n- Gather all necessary raw materials before attempting to craft items. For example, wood is required to craft a wooden chest.\n\n### Errors when lacking technology for crafting\n- Research the required technology before attempting to craft items that depend on it. For example, Steel Processing technology must be researched to craft a steel chest.\n\n### Errors when not having enough resources for research\n- Ensure to collect enough Automation Science Packs to conduct research. Without sufficient packs, research cannot be completed."}
