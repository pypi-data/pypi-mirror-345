{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Setup at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and transfers it to the adjacent chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates, though currently not receiving ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Misalignment\n- Ensure that inserters are correctly aligned to pick up items from the source and drop them into the target. Verify both pickup and drop positions.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Ingredients\n- Check that the inserter is properly configured to transfer items to the furnace. Ensure the inserter is powered and aligned correctly.\n\n### Mining Drill Out of Fuel\n- Regularly refuel mining drills to prevent them from stopping production. Monitor fuel levels and replenish as needed.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Verify that the source (e.g., chest) contains items for the inserter to pick up. Ensure the inserter is not blocked or misaligned.\n\n### Furnace Lacking Ingredients\n- Ensure that the furnace has the necessary ingredients to smelt. Check the inserter setup and inventory to confirm the supply chain is intact."}
