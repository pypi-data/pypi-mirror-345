{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=25.5, y=-11.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=25.5, y=-11.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=12.5, y=6.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\n- Connected by a network of pipes and electric poles, but currently not generating power due to connection issues.\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=2.0, y=0.0) fueled by coal, with copper plates as the output.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) fueled by coal, with iron plates as the output.\n- Connected by a network of belts and inserters (details omitted due to stale entity data).\n\n### Additional Electricity Generators\n- Multiple steam engines and boilers located at various positions, such as (x=-10.5, y=17.5), (x=-24.5, y=23.5), (x=14.5, y=35.5), and others, all not connected to a functional power network and not generating power.\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- Extensive pipe networks at various positions, all currently empty and not connected to any fluid source.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure there is no collision with existing entities or water when placing pipes. Consider increasing spacing or changing the direction or reference position.\n- Verify the target position is valid and not already occupied by another entity.\n\n### Errors in Connecting Electric Poles\n- Avoid placing electric poles in positions already occupied by other entities. Increase spacing or change the direction or reference position if necessary.\n- Ensure electric poles are properly connected to form a continuous power network.\n\n### Steam Engine Not Generating Power\n- Check all connections between the steam engine, boiler, and offshore pump. Ensure there are no missing or misaligned pipes or poles.\n- Verify that the steam engine is connected to a functional power network and receiving the necessary input liquid.\n\n### General Placement Errors\n- Before placing any entity, ensure the target tile is unoccupied and suitable for the entity type.\n- Adjust spacing and direction as needed to avoid placement conflicts.\n\n### Errors in Picking Up Entities\n- Ensure the correct position is specified when attempting to pick up entities. The position must be accurate and correspond to the actual location of the entity.\n- Verify that the entity exists at the specified position before attempting to pick it up.\n\n### Repeated Errors in Picking Up Small Electric Poles\n- Double-check the position of the small electric poles before attempting to pick them up. Ensure that the poles exist at the specified positions.\n- Consider using a more reliable method to track the positions of entities on the map to avoid such errors.\n\n### Errors in Placing Entities on Occupied Tiles\n- When placing entities like pipes or electric poles, ensure the target position is not already occupied. Increase spacing, change direction, or adjust the reference position to avoid conflicts."}
