{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-3.5, 26.0)\nConsists of:\n- Boiler at position (-3.5, 26.0)\n- Offshore pump at position (-11.5, 26.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Multiple stone furnaces at positions (0.0, 0.0), (10.0, 0.0), (13.0, 0.0), and (16.0, 0.0) with warnings of \"no ingredients to smelt\".\n- Wooden chests at positions (8.5, -0.5), (17.5, -0.5), (19.5, -0.5), and (20.5, -0.5).\n- Burner inserters at positions (8.5, 0.5), (17.5, 0.5), (19.5, 0.5), and (20.5, 0.5) with warnings of \"inserter waiting for source items\".\n- Wooden chests at positions (8.5, 1.5), (17.5, 1.5), and (19.5, 1.5) containing iron ore.\n\n### Pipe Network\nConsists of multiple PipeGroups with various positions and statuses indicating they are empty:\n- PipeGroup at position (17.5, 3.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (-0.5, 11.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (5.5, 18.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (-8.5, 21.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (18.5, 21.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (22.5, 20.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (-8.5, 23.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (-0.5, 22.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (14.5, 22.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (16.5, 23.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (7.5, 24.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (-2.5, 27.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (5.5, 27.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (34.5, 27.5)\n\n### Electricity Network\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at various positions, indicating a network setup.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors When Using Extracting but Being Too Far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors When Placing into a Tile Which is Occupied by Another Entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Connection Errors Between Offshore Pump and Boiler\n- Ensure that the path between the offshore pump and the boiler is clear and that the correct type of pipes (either 'Pipe' or 'UndergroundPipe') are used to connect them.\n\n### Incorrect Usage of Pickup Entity Function\n- When using the `pickup_entity` function, ensure that the second argument is a Position object to avoid ValueError."}
