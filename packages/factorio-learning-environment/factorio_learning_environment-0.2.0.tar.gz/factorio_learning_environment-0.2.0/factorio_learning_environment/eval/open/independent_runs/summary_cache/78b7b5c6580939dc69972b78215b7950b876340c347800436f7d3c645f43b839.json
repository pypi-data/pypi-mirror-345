{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll summarize the structures and error tips:\n\n# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line at (-15.0, -50.0)\nA complete smelting setup consisting of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-15.0, -50.0) facing down, mining iron ore\n- Burner inserter at (-14.5, -48.5) transferring ore from drill to furnace\n- Stone furnace at (-14.0, -47.0) for smelting iron plates\nAll machines are fueled with coal and connected in sequence.\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with entity placement\n- When placing entities next to each other, ensure there is proper spacing to avoid collisions with existing structures\n- Check the direction and position parameters when placing entities to ensure they can properly interact with each other\n\n### Errors with item insertion\n- Verify required items are in inventory before attempting to insert them into entities\n- When inserting fuel or materials, ensure the target entity exists and is valid\n\n### Errors with crafting\n- Some items like iron plates cannot be crafted directly and require smelting in a furnace\n- When crafting items that need sub-ingredients, ensure all required materials are available or can be crafted first\n\n### Type errors\n- When calculating positions or dimensions, ensure proper numeric values are used instead of model attributes\n- Convert model attributes to their numeric values before performing calculations\n\n### Resource access errors\n- Move close enough to resources before attempting to extract from them\n- Ensure the extraction target is a valid resource entity"}
