{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Factory at position(-5, -65)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace (position -5, -65) with an inventory containing iron-ore and iron-plate.\n- Boiler (position 0.5, 6.0) that requires connection to a water source.\n- Steam Engine (position 0.5, 0.5) that is not connected to the power network.\n- Pipe Groups for fluid connections.\n\n### Coal and Iron Ore Mining Area\n- Burner Mining Drill (position 47.0, -82.0) for coal extraction.\n- Burner Mining Drills for iron ore located at position (-15.5, -50.5).\n\n### Wooden Chests\n- Wooden Chest (position 46.5, -83.5) with an inventory containing coal.\n- Wooden Chest (position 48.5, -83.5) with an empty inventory.\n- Wooden Chest (position 5.5, -79.5) with an empty inventory.\n- Wooden Chest (position 10.5, -79.5) with an empty inventory.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to Furnace operation\n- **Furnace does not have enough resources to start smelting**: Ensure that the furnace has both iron ore and coal in sufficient quantities before attempting to start smelting.\n- **Failed to insert coal into stone-furnace**: Check the inventory of the furnace before inserting coal. If the furnace is full, you will need to extract items before adding more fuel.\n\n### Errors when connecting structures\n- **Could not find either the Boiler or the Steam Engine to connect, or not enough pipes**: Verify that the boiler and steam engine are properly connected with sufficient pipes to allow for fluid transfer.\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- **Cannot place Offshore Pump as it is not in inventory**: Ensure that you have the Offshore Pump in your inventory before attempting to place it.\n\n### Errors when extracting items\n- **Could not extract iron-plate**: Ensure that the furnace contains iron plates before attempting to extract them. If the inventory is empty or the furnace is not operational, extraction will fail."}
