{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) which extracts iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (x=-15.5, y=-48.5) and (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) for storing extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) which transfers iron ore from chests to furnaces.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (x=-12.0, y=-48.0) and (x=-10.0, y=-48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-6.5, y=-48.5) for storing iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserters** at positions (x=-14.5, y=-47.5) and (x=-8.5, y=-47.5) for moving items between entities.\n\n### Iron Ore Storage and Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (x=-14.5, y=-46.5) and (x=-7.5, y=-47.5) for storing and transferring iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-11.5, y=-45.5) which is responsible for moving iron ore from storage to furnaces.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Missing Entities\n- Ensure that entities exist at the specified positions before attempting to interact with them. This will prevent errors such as \"Could not get Prototype.WoodenChest at position x=-11.5 y=-44.5.\"\n\n### Errors with Undefined Names\n- Verify that all entity names are correctly defined and available in the current context to avoid errors like \"name 'Chest' is not defined.\"\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Check that the source entities have available items for inserters to pick up. This will prevent inserters from being idle due to lack of source items.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Space in Destination\n- Ensure that destination entities have enough space to accept items from inserters to avoid bottlenecks in item transfer processes."}
