{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with coal fuel and iron-plate output.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=2.0, y=0.0) with coal fuel and iron-plate output.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=1.5, y=1.5) moving items from the furnace at (x=0.0, y=0.0) to the furnace at (x=2.0, y=0.0).\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=3.5, y=1.5) moving items from the furnace at (x=2.0, y=0.0).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when crafting items without required resources\n- Ensure all required raw resources are gathered before attempting to craft items. For example, wood must be gathered before crafting wooden chests.\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied positions\n- Verify that the target position for placing an entity is unoccupied. Adjust the position or direction if necessary to avoid conflicts with existing structures.\n\n### Errors when referencing undefined variables\n- Ensure that all variables, such as entity references, are properly defined and initialized before use. Double-check spelling and case sensitivity.\n\n### Errors when inserting items without inventory stock\n- Confirm that the required items are available in the inventory before attempting to insert them into other entities.\n\n### Errors when retrieving non-existent entities\n- Make sure that the entity exists at the specified position before attempting to retrieve or interact with it."}
