{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5) for coal extraction and storage.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining Facility at Position (-25.0, -64.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-25.0, -64.0) with transport belts connecting to other entities for copper ore extraction.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage Facility at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -54.5) for iron ore extraction and storage.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with a Burner Inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) transferring items between Wooden Chests at positions (1.5, 0.5) and (3.5, 0.5).\n\n### Belt Networks\nConsists of several BeltGroups facilitating transport between various structures:\n- BeltGroup from (x=-26.5, y=-65.5) to (x=-22.5, y=-65.5)\n- BeltGroup from (x=-23.5, y=-64.5) to (x=-21.5, y=-64.5)\n- BeltGroup from (x=-20.5, y=-64.5) to (x=-20.5, y=-66.5)\n- BeltGroup from (x=-21.5, y=-64.5) to (x=-21.5, y=-66.5)\n- BeltGroup from (x=-14.5, y=-63.5) to (x=-14.5, y=-65.5)\n- BeltGroup from (x=-18.5, y=-63.5) to (x=-16.5, y=-63.5)\n- BeltGroup from (x=-14.5, y=-54.5) to (x=-17.5, y=-59.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities where the space is occupied\n- Ensure the target location is clear before placing an entity. For example, the attempt to place a burner-inserter at (-23.0, -67.0) failed due to obstruction.\n\n### Errors related to fuel management\n- Regularly check and refuel entities like Burner Mining Drills to avoid them running out of fuel, as seen with the drill at position (-25.0, -64.0).\n\n### Errors related to ingredient supply\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt to avoid warnings like \"no ingredients to smelt,\" as seen in multiple furnaces."}
