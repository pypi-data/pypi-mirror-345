If a wooden chest or another entity is already present, consider adjusting the spacing, changing the direction, or selecting a different reference position.\n\n### Errors when Using Inserters without Power\n- Ensure that inserters are connected to a power source. Place small electric poles nearby to provide electricity to the inserters.\n\n### Errors when Entities are Out of Fuel\n- Regularly check fuel levels in boilers and burner mining drills to ensure continuous operation. Refill them with the appropriate fuel as needed.\n\n### Errors when Assembling Machines are Missing Resources\n- Ensure that assembling machines have the necessary resources, such as copper plates, to produce the intended products. Check the input inventory and supply chain to resolve any shortages.\n\n### Errors when Steam Engines are Not Receiving Electricity\n- Verify that steam engines are properly connected to a power grid and receiving input liquid. Ensure that the fluid system is functioning correctly and that there are no disconnections in the pipe network."}
