{"content": "The error indicates that there is still an insufficient number of copper plates available to craft the copper cables needed for the electric poles. Let's address this by ensuring that more copper ore is processed into copper plates.\n\nHere's how to proceed:\n\n1. **Check for Additional Copper Ore**: Ensure that there is copper ore available to smelt into copper plates.\n2. **Insert Copper Ore into Furnace**: If there is copper ore in your inventory, insert it into the furnace for smelting.\n3. **Wait for Smelting**: Allow the furnace to process the copper ore into copper plates.\n4. **Craft Copper Cables**: Once you have enough copper plates, craft the copper cables.\n5. **Craft and Place Electric Poles**: Use the copper cables and wood to craft and place the electric poles.\n\nLet's execute these steps:\n\n```python\n# Check if there is copper ore in the inventory\ninventory = inspect_inventory()\ncopper_ore_available = inventory.get(Prototype.CopperOre, 0)\n\nif copper_ore_available > 0:\n    # Insert copper ore into the furnace for smelting\n    insert_item(Prototype.CopperOre, furnace_entity, quantity=copper_ore_available)\n    print(f\"Inserted {copper_ore_available} copper ore into the furnace.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No copper ore available in inventory.
