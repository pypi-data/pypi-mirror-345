# red_black_tree

A type of [self-balancing](/data_md/mathematics/definitions/graph/tree/b_tree.md) [binary search tree](/data_md/mathematics/definitions/graph/tree/binary_search_tree.md). The red-black tree is named after the colors used to represent the [nodes](/data_md/mathematics/definitions/graph/node.md). The tree maintains certain properties to ensure that it remains approximately balanced, allowing for efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations. The properties include:

1. Each node is either red or black.
2. The root node is always black.
3. All [leaves](/data_md/mathematics/definitions/graph/tree/leaf.md) are black.
4. If a red node has children, then both children are black.
5. Every path from a node to its descendant leaves has the same number of black nodes.

These properties ensure that the tree remains approximately balanced, allowing for efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations.
