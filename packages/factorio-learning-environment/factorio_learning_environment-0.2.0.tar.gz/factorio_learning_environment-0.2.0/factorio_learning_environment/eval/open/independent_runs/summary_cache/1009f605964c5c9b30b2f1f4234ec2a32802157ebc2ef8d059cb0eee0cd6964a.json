{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Setup at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) extracting iron ore and transferring it to a chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5) storing extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5) transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0) intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates, but currently not receiving iron ore due to setup issues.\n\n### Coal Refueling Setup\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5) and (-14.5, -47.5) are frequently refueled with coal to maintain operation.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Misalignment Issues\n- Ensure that inserters are correctly aligned with both their pickup and drop positions. Misalignment can prevent items from being transferred properly.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Ingredients\n- Verify that the inserter is correctly positioned and functioning to ensure iron ore is being transferred to the furnace. Check the inserter's pickup and drop positions.\n\n### Inventory Management for Refueling\n- Maintain a sufficient supply of coal in your inventory to refuel mining drills and inserters. Running out of coal can halt operations.\n\n### Error in Item Insertion\n- Ensure that the required items are available in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities."}
