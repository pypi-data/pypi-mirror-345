{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo permanent structures have been successfully established on the map. The agent made several attempts to deploy a Lab at (0.5, 2.5) for supplying Automation Science Packs, but each placement or crafting attempt failed. Although operations involving smelting in furnaces were executed (using a furnace at (5.0, 5.0) and a copper furnace at (-27.0, -60.0)), these units were retrieved from the map rather than newly constructed by the agent.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 get_entities Usage Errors  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u2013 Avoid passing unsupported arguments such as \u201cradius\u201d or extra positional parameters to get_entities. Always confirm the API signature before making the call.\n\n\u2022 Lab Placement Without Inventory  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u2013 Verify that the Lab item is present in the inventory prior to attempting placement to prevent placement failures.\n\n\u2022 Iteration Over a NoneType Collection  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u2013 When retrieving entities (e.g. labs), check for a None return value and default to an empty list before iterating.\n\n\u2022 Lab Crafting Resource Shortages  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u2013 Ensure that all sub-ingredients and intermediate production steps (iron-plate, iron-gear-wheel, electronic-circuit, copper-cable) are available or producible through proper crafting or smelting facilities before attempting to craft a Lab."}
