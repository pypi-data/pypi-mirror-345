{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and transfers it to a nearby chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0): Smelts iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-1.5, 0.5): Transfers iron plates from the furnace to another location.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Misalignment of Inserters\n- Ensure that inserters are correctly aligned with both the source and destination entities. Misalignment can prevent the transfer of items.\n\n### Fuel Management\n- Regularly check and refuel entities like mining drills and inserters to maintain operational status. Running out of fuel will halt production processes.\n\n### Inserter Setup\n- Verify that inserters are correctly positioned and configured to transfer items between entities. Misconfigured inserters can lead to production bottlenecks.\n\n### Resource Availability\n- Ensure that there are sufficient resources available for entities to process. For example, furnaces should have a steady supply of iron ore to produce iron plates."}
