{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, -60.0) with fuel (coal: 4) and energy 2666.67, currently working. It is connected to:\n  - **Wooden Chest** at position (4.5, -58.5) with inventory containing iron ore.\n  - Additional **Wooden Chests** at positions (5.5, -60.5), (7.5, -60.5), (6.5, -60.5), (9.5, -60.5), and (8.5, -60.5) for storage purposes.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions:\n  - (-15.0, -48.0) with fuel (coal: 11), currently working with iron ore and producing iron plates.\n  - (-13.0, -48.0) with fuel (coal: 42), currently working with iron ore and producing iron plates.\n  - (-11.0, -48.0) with fuel (coal: 50), currently not working due to lack of ingredients and full fuel source.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Full Inventory\n- Ensure that the chest at the drop position of the burner mining drill is emptied regularly to avoid mining interruptions. The warning indicates that the chest at (4.5, -58.5) is full.\n\n### Errors Related to Furnace Operations\n- Ensure that furnaces have a continuous supply of ingredients to maintain production. The furnace at (-11.0, -48.0) is not working due to no ingredients to smelt and a full fuel source.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions**: None defined in the logs.\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `iron_ore_extracted: int` - Number of iron ore extracted from the chest.\n  - `iron_plate_inventory: int` - Current count of iron plates in the inventory.\n  - `furnace_fuel: dict` - Fuel inventory for each furnace.\n  - `burner_drill_fuel: dict` - Fuel inventory for the burner mining drill."}
