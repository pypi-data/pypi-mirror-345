For example, crafting iron gear wheels requires iron plates, which must be available in sufficient quantity.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it. Check for existing entities in the target location.\n\n### Errors when crafting without required machines\n- Verify that you have the necessary machines (like furnaces or assembling machines) available for the crafting recipes you are attempting to use."}
