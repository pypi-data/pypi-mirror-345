{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-2.5, 24.0)\nConsists of:\n- **Steam Engine** at position (-5.5, 19.5), status: WORKING\n- **Boiler** at position (-2.5, 24.0), status: WORKING\n- **Offshore Pump** at position (-9.5, 24.5), status: WORKING\n- **Pipe Group** connecting the steam engine and boiler, with positions including (-4.5, 16.5), (-5.5, 16.5), etc., status: WORKING\n- **Pipe Group** connecting the offshore pump and boiler, with positions including (-9.5, 23.5), (-8.5, 23.5), etc., status: WORKING\n- **Electricity Group** with small electric poles at positions (-7.5, 22.5), (-6.5, 22.5), and (-1.5, 20.5), status: NOT PLUGGED IN ELECTRIC NETWORK\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0), status: NO INGREDIENTS\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Inventory Management\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to place or connect entities. For example, attempting to place a small electric pole without having it in inventory resulted in a failure.\n\n### Errors When Connecting Entities\n- Verify that you have the necessary resources and items to connect entities such as pipes. Multiple attempts to connect pipes between the offshore pump and boiler failed due to missing items or incorrect connections.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Fuel\n- Ensure that fuel is available in the inventory before attempting to insert it into entities like the boiler. Multiple attempts failed due to a lack of coal in the inventory.\n\n### Errors in Power Connectivity\n- Ensure that all components of the electricity network are properly connected and powered. The electricity group was reported as not plugged into the electric network, indicating a connectivity issue.\n\n### Assertion Errors\n- Verify the operational status of entities like the steam engine before asserting their status. An assertion error occurred because the steam engine was not working as expected.\n\nBy addressing these issues, you can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of your setup in the game."}
