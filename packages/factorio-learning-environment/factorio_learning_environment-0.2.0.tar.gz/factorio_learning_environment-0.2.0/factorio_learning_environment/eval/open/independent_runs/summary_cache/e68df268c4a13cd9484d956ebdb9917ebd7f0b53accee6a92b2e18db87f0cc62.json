{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=0.5, y=28.0)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (x=-3.5, y=27.5)\n- Boiler at Position (x=0.5, y=28.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (x=7.5, y=39.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine, facilitating water and steam flow.\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (x=40.0, y=-84.0)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (x=40.5, y=-82.5) for coal storage\n- Wooden Chest at Position (x=41.5, y=-83.5) as additional storage\n- BeltGroup for transporting coal\n- Burner Inserter at Position (x=41.5, y=-80.5) for moving coal from the chest to other entities\n\n### Iron Plate Storage\nConsists of:\n- Iron Chest at Position (x=0.5, y=0.5) containing coal and iron plates\n- Iron Chest at Position (x=1.5, y=0.5) containing coal\n- Iron Chest at Position (x=2.5, y=0.5) containing coal\n\n### Laboratory Setup\nConsists of:\n- Lab with input for automation science packs, currently without power\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Full Storage\n- Ensure that storage chests are regularly emptied to avoid mining interruptions. The chest at (40.5, -82.5) is full, preventing further coal mining.\n\n### Errors with Electricity Generation\n- Connect the steam engine to the power network and ensure it has a liquid input. The steam engine at (x=7.5, y=39.5) is not connected to the power network and lacks input liquid, which prevents electricity generation.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that inserters have access to source items. The burner inserter at (x=54.5, y=-83.5) is waiting for source items, indicating a potential supply chain issue."}
