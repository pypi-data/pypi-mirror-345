{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-0.5, 25.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (-0.5, 25.5)\n- Boiler at position (-5.5, 25.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe network connecting these entities:\n  - Pipe at position (-8.5, 23.5)\n  - Pipe at position (-9.5, 22.5)\n  - Pipe at position (-9.5, 23.5)\n  - Pipe-to-ground at position (-8.5, 23.5)\n  - Additional pipes connecting various positions\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- PipeGroup at position (-1.5, 17.5), status: EMPTY\n- PipeGroup at position (-8.5, 20.5), status: WORKING, fluid: water\n- PipeGroup at position (-7.5, 25.5), status: EMPTY\n\n### Miscellaneous Entities\n- Furnace at position (15.0, 0.0), status: NO_INGREDIENTS\n- Wooden Chest at position (5.5, 0.5), status: NORMAL\n- Inserters at positions (17.5, 0.5) and (16.5, 0.5), status: NO_POWER\n- Electricity Group with poles at various positions, voltage: 0\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Pipe Placement\n- Ensure that the target position for placing pipes is unoccupied. Remove any obstructing pipes or entities before attempting to place new pipes.\n\n### Errors with Boiler and Steam Engine Not Connected\n- Verify that all necessary connections between the boiler, steam engine, and offshore pump are correctly established. Ensure that pipes are properly connected to transport fluids between these entities.\n\n### Errors with Underground Pipe Placement\n- Adjust the positioning of underground pipes to ensure they can be placed without obstruction. Verify that the start and end points of underground pipes are correctly aligned.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Not Receiving Power\n- Check that inserters are connected to a power source. Ensure that the electricity network is operational and that poles are correctly placed to provide power to the inserters."}
