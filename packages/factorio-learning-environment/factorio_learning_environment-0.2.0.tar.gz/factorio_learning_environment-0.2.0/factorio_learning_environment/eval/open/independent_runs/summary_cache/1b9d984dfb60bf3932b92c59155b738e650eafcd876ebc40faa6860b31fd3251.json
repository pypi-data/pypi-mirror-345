{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) with a drop position at (52.5, -84.5)\n- Wooden Chests at positions (52.5, -84.5) and (54.5, -84.5) for storage\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Storage at Position (-23.0, -68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) with a drop position at (23.5, -69.5)\n- Wooden Chests at positions (-23.5, -69.5) and (-24.5, -67.5) for storage\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) with a drop position at (-14.5, -54.5)\n- Wooden Chests at positions (-14.5, -54.5) and (-12.5, -54.5) for storage\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5) facilitating movement between chests\n\n### Iron Plate Production at Position (-20.0, -70.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -70.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n- Wooden Chests for storage of iron ore and iron plates\n\n### Copper Plate Production at Positions (0.0, 0.0) and (5.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnaces at positions (0.0, 0.0) and (5.0, 0.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n- Wooden Chests for storage of copper ore and copper plates\n\n### Transport Belt System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (1.5, 1.5) to (3.5, 1.5) and (2.5, 1.5) to (4.5, 1.5)\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (3.5, 2.5) to (5.5, 2.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### NameError when Checking Inserter Type\n- Ensure that the correct class name is used when checking the type of an entity. For example, use 'factorio_entities.BurnerInserter' instead of 'BurnerInserter'.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Verify that the source entity has items available for the inserter to pick up. Ensure that the source chest or entity is not empty.\n\n### Chest Full Warnings\n- Regularly check and empty storage chests to prevent mining drills from halting due to full chests.\n\n### Out of Fuel Warnings\n- Keep track of fuel levels in mining drills and inserters to ensure continuous operation. Regularly refuel entities that require fuel.\n\n### No Ingredients to Smelt in Furnaces\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Check the supply chain to verify that raw materials are being delivered to the furnaces."}
