Repeated attempts to craft and place a Lab at position (0.5, 2.5) were made, but none were successfully deployed. Other facilities used for processing (such as the furnace at (5.0, 5.0) and the copper furnace at (\u201327.0, \u201360.0)) were employed temporarily for resource conversion and do not count as map structures.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 Incorrect API Usage \u2013 get_entities\n  \u2013 Errors showed an unexpected keyword argument \u201cradius\u201d and later an error stating that 0 positional arguments were expected but 3 were given.\n  \u2013 Tip: Verify and use the proper function signature for get_entities, ensuring that arguments are passed according to the API specification.\n\n\u2022 Lab Placement Failures and Inventory Checks\n  \u2013 Attempts to place a Lab at (0.5, 2.5) failed because no Lab was present in inventory.\n  \u2013 Tip: Confirm that the Lab item is available in inventory before trying to place it on the map.\n\n\u2022 Iterating Over a NoneType Collection\n  \u2013 Filtering lab entities resulted in a \u201cNoneType object is not iterable\u201d error.\n  \u2013 Tip: Always validate that the returned collection (from functions like get_entities) is not None before proceeding with iteration.\n\n\u2022 Lab Crafting Resource Shortages\n  \u2013 Multiple crafting errors occurred due to missing sub-ingredients (such as iron-gear-wheel, electronic-circuit, and copper-cable) in the lab production chain.\n  \u2013 Tip: Ensure that all required intermediary components and basic resources are available or producible before initiating lab crafting."}
