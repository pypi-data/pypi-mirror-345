{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -50.0) used for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-12.5, -49.5) used to insert items into the furnace.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-11.5, -49.5) likely used for storing materials or finished products.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Insufficient Inventory for Insertion\n- Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into a structure. This will prevent errors such as \"Could not insert: No coal to insert from your inventory\" or \"Could not insert: No iron-ore to insert from your inventory.\"\n\n### Timeout Error\n- Avoid using long sleep durations that may lead to a TimeoutError. Consider breaking down tasks into smaller intervals or using more efficient waiting mechanisms.\n\n### Errors from Entities Running Out of Fuel\n- Regularly check and refuel entities like furnaces and inserters to prevent them from running out of fuel, which can halt production processes."}
