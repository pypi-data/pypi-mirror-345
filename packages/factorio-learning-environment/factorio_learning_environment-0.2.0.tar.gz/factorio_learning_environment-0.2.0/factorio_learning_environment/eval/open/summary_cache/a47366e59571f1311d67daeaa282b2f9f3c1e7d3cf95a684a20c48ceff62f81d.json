{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron ore mining and smelting structure at position around (17.5, 72.5)\nConsists of the following connected entities:\n- Electric mining drill at position (17.5, 72.5) facing down, powered but output blocked due to furnace belt blockage.\n- Stone furnace at position (18.0, 75.0) fueled with coal, actively smelting iron ore, but output inventory frequently full.\n- Two wooden chests at positions (19.5, 75.5) and (21.5, 75.5) storing smelted iron plates.\n- Additional wooden chest at (21.5, 77.5) receiving iron plates, with burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5) and (20.5, 77.5) feeding the chests.\n- Small electric pole at (15.5, 75.5) connected to power network.\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5), (20.5, 77.5) fueled and operational.\n- Persistent output blockage warning at furnace belt drop position affecting mining drill operation.\n\nThis structure enables extraction, smelting, and staged storage of iron plates with stable power and inserter fueling, though output belt blockage remains unresolved.\n\n### Steam power generation structure at position around (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, -0.5) extracting water.\n- Boiler at position (-5.0, 2.5) fueled with coal, currently working but recently experienced fuel shortage.\n- Steam engine at position (0.5, 6.5) connected to boiler by pipes, currently generating power.\n- Small electric poles near boiler (-4.5, -0.5), steam engine (0.5, 3.5), and newly placed poles at (0.5, 6.5), (17.5, 72.5), and (25.5, 80.5) connected to power network.\n\nThis structure reliably generates electricity from steam power, supplying the factory\u2019s electric network with some recent fuel management attention.\n\n### Iron gear wheel assembly structure at position around (25.5, 80.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine 2 at (25.5, 80.5), powered and connected to the electric network.\n- Input wooden chest at (21.5, 75.5) feeding iron plates into assembly area.\n- Output wooden chest at (25.5, 82.5) for assembled items.\n- Output burner inserter at (25.5, 83.5) fueled and operational, moving assembled items into output chest.\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 77.5) and (25.5, 83.5) fueled and operational.\n- Assembling machine intermittently receiving iron plates but frequently empty, causing crafting shortages.\n\nThis structure is intended for iron gear wheel production and now has power and output inserter setup but requires consistent iron plate input to operate effectively.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Persistent output blockage at furnace belt drop position\n- The electric mining drill at (17.5, 72.5) reports \"furnace belt at drop position is blocked,\" causing output blockage.\n- The furnace output inventory is frequently full, preventing further smelting output.\n- To resolve, clear or extend output belts and chests to accept items, ensuring continuous item flow from furnace to storage.\n- Regularly check and maintain output belt and chest capacity to prevent bottlenecks.\n\n### Inserter fuel and inventory management\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5), (20.5, 77.5), and (25.5, 83.5) are now consistently fueled and operational.\n- Previous issues with inserters running out of fuel or having full inventories have been mitigated by inserting coal and managing inventories.\n- Continue monitoring inserter fuel levels and inventories to prevent stoppages.\n\n### Crafting and input supply errors in assembling machine\n- Assembling machine 2 at (25.5, 80.5) frequently reports shortage of iron plates, preventing crafting of iron gear wheels.\n- Input inventories often empty despite iron plates being available in input chests.\n- Ensure reliable and continuous supply of iron plates from input chests to assembling machine input.\n- Verify inserters feeding the assembling machine are operational and not blocked.\n- Maintain clear output paths to avoid output chest congestion.\n\n### Entity placement conflicts due to occupied tiles\n- Attempts to place small electric poles near the furnace at (18.0, 75.0) failed due to collisions with nearby mining drill at (17.5, 72.5) or water tiles.\n- To avoid these errors, always verify tile occupancy before placement and consider adjusting placement parameters such as spacing, direction, or reference position to find free tiles.\n\n###"}
