{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining Station at (-14.0, -15.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (position x=24.0, y=-15.0)\n- Wooden chest for coal storage (position x=23.5, y=-16.5)\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Station at (-14.0, 23.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (position x=-14.0, y=23.0)\n- Wooden chest for iron ore storage (position x=-14.5, y=21.5)\n\n### Iron Smelting Area at (-10.0, 20.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace (position x=-11.0, y=20.0)\n- Stone furnace (position x=-9.0, y=20.0)\n\n### Copper Processing Complex at (22.0, 20.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill for copper ore (position x=20.0, y=20.0)\n- Wooden chest for copper ore storage (position x=20.5, y=21.5)\n- Stone furnace for smelting (position x=24.0, y=20.0)\n- Wooden chest for copper plate storage (position x=24.5, y=17.5)\n- Burner inserter system:\n  - Inserter at (x=21.5, y=21.5) moving items from chest\n  - Inserter at (x=22.5, y=20.5) feeding furnace\n  - Inserter at (x=24.5, y=18.5) moving finished plates to storage\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with belt connections\n- Cannot connect belts directly from wooden chests - must use inserters as intermediaries\n- Ensure there is clear space for belt placement - the error at position (21.5, 22.5) indicates an obstruction\n- When connecting entities with belts, verify that the path is clear and the connection points are valid for belt placement\n\n### Entity fuel management\n- Multiple burner mining drills are out of fuel - implement a fuel distribution system\n- Keep track of fuel levels in burner devices and refuel before they run out\n\n### Production chain efficiency\n- Several furnaces have no ingredients to smelt - ensure proper input material flow\n- One furnace has a full fuel inventory - monitor and balance resource distribution"}
