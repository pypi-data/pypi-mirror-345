{"content": "\"\"\"\nWe are encountering the same issue again while trying to craft the burner mining drill. The error indicates that it couldn't find the necessary crafting machine to process the iron plates for crafting.\n\n**Current Inventory:**\n- 1 stone furnace\n- 27 wood\n- 0 iron ore\n- 4 iron plates (after smelting)\n- 1 iron gear wheel\n\n### Next Steps\nTo resolve this, we need to ensure that we are using the correct crafting machine for the burner mining drill. The burner mining drill requires a crafting machine, and we currently don't have one available.\n\n1. We need to craft a basic assembly machine or a similar crafting station if we have the necessary materials.\n2. If we don't have the materials for a crafting machine, we may need to gather more resources to craft one.\n\nLet's check our inventory for the possibility of crafting a basic assembly machine or any other crafting station that can help us proceed.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Check the current inventory for crafting options\ninventory = inspect_inventory()\nprint(f\"Current Inventory: {inventory}\")\n\n# Check if we can craft an assembly machine or another crafting station\nassembly_machine_recipe = get_prototype_recipe(Prototype.AssemblyMachine1)\nprint(f\"Assembly Machine Recipe: {assembly_machine_recipe}\")  # Display the recipe for the assembly machine\n\n# Check if we have the necessary materials for the assembly machine\nrequired_materials = assembly_machine_recipe.ingredients\nprint(f\"Required materials for Assembly Machine: {required_materials}\")  # Display required materials for crafting the assembly machine", "summary_range": "[1-114]"}
