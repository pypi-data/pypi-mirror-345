Multiple recovery attempts were made to place a Lab at position (0.5, 2.5) for supplying Automation Science Packs; however, all lab placement or crafting actions failed due to inventory shortages and unmet resource prerequisites. Although operations were performed at existing furnaces (one at (5.0, 5.0) for iron smelting and another at (\u201327.0, \u201360.0) for copper smelting), these were retrieved from the environment rather than created by the agent.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 Incorrect API usage for entity retrieval\n\u2003\u2013 Using an unexpected keyword argument ('radius') led to a TypeError.\n\u2003\u2013 Passing positional arguments when none are expected resulted in another TypeError.\n\u2003\u2003Tip: Verify the function\u2019s signature and supply only the supported parameters.\n\n\u2022 Iteration over a None value\n\u2003\u2013 Attempting to iterate over the result of get_entities (when it returned None) caused a TypeError.\n\u2003\u2003Tip: Check if the returned entity list is valid (or default to an empty list) before iterating.\n\n\u2022 Lab placement failures\n\u2003\u2013 Repeated errors occurred when trying to place a Lab at (0.5, 2.5), with messages indicating no lab in inventory.\n\u2003\u2003Tip: Ensure that the Lab has been successfully crafted and is present in inventory prior to attempting placement.\n\n\u2022 Lab crafting errors due to missing ingredients\n\u2003\u2013 Several crafting attempts failed because required sub-ingredients (such as iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, and copper-cables) were missing or could not be produced.\n\u2003\u2003Tip: Verify that all resource prerequisites and intermediary crafting dependencies are met before initiating Lab crafting."}
