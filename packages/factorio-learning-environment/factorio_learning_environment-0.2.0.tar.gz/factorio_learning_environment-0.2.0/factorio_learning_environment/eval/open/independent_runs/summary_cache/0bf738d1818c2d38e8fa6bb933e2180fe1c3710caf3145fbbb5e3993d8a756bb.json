{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining Station at (-14.0, -15.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (24.0, -15.0)\n- Wooden chest at (23.5, -16.5) containing 188 coal\n\n### Iron Mining Station at (-14.0, 23.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-14.0, 23.0)\n- Wooden chest at (-14.5, 21.5) containing 710 iron ore\n\n### Iron Smelting Line at (-10.0, 20.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace at (-11.0, 20.0)\n- Stone furnace at (-9.0, 20.0)\n\n### Copper Processing Line at (22.0, 20.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (20.0, 20.0) mining copper ore\n- Input chest at (20.5, 21.5) containing 53 copper ore\n- Middle storage chest at (22.5, 21.5) containing 409 copper ore\n- Stone furnace at (24.0, 20.0)\n- Output chest at (24.5, 17.5) containing 53 copper plates\n- Burner inserter at (24.5, 18.5) moving items from furnace to output chest\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied spaces\n- Before placing any entity, check if the target position and surrounding tiles required by the entity dimensions are free\n- The agent tried to place a burner inserter at (23.5, 20.5) but failed because another entity was already there\n- Consider scanning the area or checking entity collision boxes before placement\n\n### Entity Connection Issues\n- When connecting entities with inserters, ensure the pickup and drop positions align properly with the source and target entities\n- Verify inserter rotation and position allows it to reach both the source and destination inventories\n- Make sure inserters are placed at correct distances from both source and target entities to function properly\n\n### Resource Management\n- Multiple entities are showing \"out of fuel\" warnings\n- Implement regular fuel checking and refueling routines for burner devices\n- Consider setting up automated fuel delivery systems for mining drills and inserters"}
