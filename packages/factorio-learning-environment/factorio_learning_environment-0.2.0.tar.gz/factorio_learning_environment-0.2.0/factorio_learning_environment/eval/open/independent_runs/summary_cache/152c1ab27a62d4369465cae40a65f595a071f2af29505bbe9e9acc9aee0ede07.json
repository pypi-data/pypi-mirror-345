{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) with fuel inventory containing coal. It is currently working but has a warning that the chest at the drop position is full.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-15.5, y=-51.5) storing iron ore. The chest is full, which is causing a blockage in the mining process.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-51.5) with fuel inventory containing coal, waiting for source items. It is connected to the burner mining drill and a transport belt.\n- **Transport Belt** connecting the burner inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-51.5) to the furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0).\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with fuel inventory containing coal. It has warnings indicating no ingredients to smelt and that the furnace result is full.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=0.5, y=-1.5) with fuel inventory containing coal, waiting for source items. It is connected to the transport belt and stone furnace.\n- **BeltGroup** with inputs from position (x=-13.5, y=-51.5) to (x=-11.5, y=-51.5) and outputs from position (x=0.5, y=-3.5) to (x=0.5, y=-1.5). The belt group is currently empty.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Full Inventory\n- Ensure that chests and furnaces are regularly emptied to prevent blockages in the production line. The chest at position (x=-15.5, y=-51.5) is full, halting the mining process.\n\n### Errors When Inserting Items Without Inventory\n- Before attempting to insert items into a drill or any other entity, verify that the required items are available in your inventory. The error at step 238 indicates an attempt to insert coal into a drill without having coal in the inventory.\n\n### Monitoring and Maintenance\n- Regularly check the status of belts and inserters for blockages to ensure continuous operation. The monitoring system should be used to identify and resolve any blockages promptly.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- **insert_item**: Attempts to insert a specified quantity of an item into a target entity. Failure occurs if the item is not present in the inventory, as seen in step 238.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `drill`: Represents a mining drill entity, used in the context of inserting items.\n- `inventory`: A dictionary representing the current inventory state, e.g., `{'wood': 2, 'coal': 5, 'stone': 5, 'iron-ore': 272, 'iron-plate': 922}`."}
