{"content": "I'll create a report based on the provided logs.\n\n# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Transport System (around x=41-45, y=-80 to -83)\nComplex automated coal mining and transport setup consisting of:\n- Burner mining drill (x=41.0, y=-82.0) mining coal\n- Storage system with two chests:\n  - Iron chest (x=41.5, y=-83.5) storing 1600 coal\n  - Wooden chest (x=41.5, y=-80.5) acting as buffer with ~640 coal\n- Transport system:\n  - Inserter (x=42.5, y=-80.5) moving coal from wooden chest to transport belt\n  - Transport belt (x=43.5, y=-80.5) facing DOWN\n  - Furnace inserter (x=43.5, y=-81.5) facing RIGHT to feed furnaces\n\n### Furnace Setup (around x=45-49, y=-81)\nTwo stone furnaces set up:\n- First furnace (x=45.0, y=-81.0)\n- Second furnace (x=47.0, y=-81.0)\nBoth currently idle with 50 coal fuel each\n\n### Storage System (x=49.5, y=-80.5)\n- Wooden chest containing 1500 iron plates\n\n### Transport Belt System\n- Main belt group running from y=-68.5 to y=-77.5 with 10 belts in sequence\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n1. Entity Placement Conflicts\n   - Before placing entities, verify the target location is clear of other entities\n   - Multiple attempts to place inserters and belts failed due to existing entities in the way\n   - Consider removing conflicting entities first or finding alternative positions\n\n2. Transport System Design\n   - Ensure transport belt and inserter orientations align properly for material flow\n   - When creating complex transport systems, plan the layout considering the space constraints\n   - Consider the reach of inserters when designing transport systems\n\n3. Belt Blocking\n   - Transport belts can get blocked, preventing proper material flow\n   - Ensure downstream processes can consume materials fast enough\n   - Monitor belt saturation and adjust input/output rates accordingly\n\n# NAMESPACE\n\n### Variables\n- `furnace_inserter`: BurnerInserter\n- `belt2`: TransportBelt\n- `belt1`: TransportBelt\n\n### System States\nThe following system states have been observed:\n- Mining drill: WORKING\n- Chest inserter: WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION\n- Transport belt: WORKING\n- Furnace inserter: WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS\n- Furnace: NO_INGREDIENTS"}
