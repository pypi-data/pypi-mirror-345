Although several attempts were made to place a Lab at (0.5, 2.5), all placement operations failed. Production facilities such as furnaces were referenced for smelting actions; however, these were retrieved from the map (or assumed pre\u2010existing) and were not newly constructed by the agent.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 API call errors with get_entities:\n  \u2013 Use the correct function signature when invoking get_entities. Avoid using unexpected keyword arguments (for example, do not supply \u201cradius\u201d) or extra positional arguments if the API does not support them.\n  \u2013 When get_entities does not find any entities, use a fallback (such as an empty list) rather than assuming a valid iterable.\n\n\u2022 Lab placement and crafting failures:\n  \u2013 Before attempting to place a Lab (e.g., at (0.5, 2.5)), verify that the Lab exists in your inventory.\n  \u2013 When crafting a Lab, ensure that all prerequisite components\u2014such as iron-gear-wheels, electronic circuits, and copper cables\u2014are available in sufficient quantities. Review and confirm that the production chains for iron plates, copper plates, and their derivatives are fully operational.\n  \n\u2022 Handling None values:\n  \u2013 When iterating over results from entity queries, guard against NoneType returns to prevent type errors. Implement a check or fallback to an empty list when no entities are found."}
