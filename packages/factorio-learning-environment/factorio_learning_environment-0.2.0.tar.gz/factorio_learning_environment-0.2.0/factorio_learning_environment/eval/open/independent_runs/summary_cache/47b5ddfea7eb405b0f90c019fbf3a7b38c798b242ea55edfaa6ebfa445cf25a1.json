{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=20.5, y=-4.0)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=22.5, y=-7.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=20.5, y=-4.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=4.5, y=-10.5)\n- Connected by a series of pipes and small electric poles for fluid and power distribution.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Two Stone Furnaces at positions (x=0.0, y=0.0) and (x=2.0, y=0.0) with coal as fuel, currently lacking ingredients to smelt.\n- A Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-11.0, y=20.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=-11.5, y=18.5) for iron ore storage.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=20.0, y=20.0) fueled with coal and connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=19.5, y=18.5) for copper ore storage.\n\n### Copper Cable Factory\nConsists of:\n- Assembling Machine at position (x=10.5, y=0.5) with an inserter waiting for source items.\n- A belt group connecting the furnace to the assembling machine.\n- Small electric poles providing power to the assembling machine.\n\n### Inserter and Chest System\nConsists of:\n- Inserter at position (x=-3.5, y=1.5) connected to two Wooden Chests at positions (x=-3.5, y=0.5) and (x=-3.5, y=2.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Resources\n- Ensure you have the necessary resources in your inventory before attempting to insert items into entities. For example, attempting to insert coal into the boiler failed due to lack of coal in the inventory.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Check that the source items are available and accessible to the inserters to prevent them from waiting indefinitely.\n\n### Errors with Furnaces and Assembling Machines Lacking Ingredients\n- Regularly check the supply of ingredients to the furnaces and assembling machines to ensure continuous production. For instance, stone furnaces are currently without ingredients to smelt, and the assembling machine lacks copper plates for copper cable production."}
