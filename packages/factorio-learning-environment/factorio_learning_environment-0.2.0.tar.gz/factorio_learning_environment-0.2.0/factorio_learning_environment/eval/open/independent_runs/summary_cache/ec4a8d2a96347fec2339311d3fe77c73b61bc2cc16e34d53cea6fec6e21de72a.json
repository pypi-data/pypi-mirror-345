{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Complex (around position -8,-59)\nConsists of three burner mining drills in a row mining iron ore:\n- Left drill at (-10.0, -59.0)\n- Middle drill at (-8.0, -59.0)\n- Right drill at (-6.0, -59.0)\nEach drill outputs to wooden chests at positions (-9.5, -57.5), (-7.5, -57.5), and (-5.5, -57.5) respectively\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line (around position 3,0)\nFour parallel smelting stations, each consisting of:\n- Stone furnaces at positions (0.0, 0.0), (2.0, 0.0), (4.0, 0.0), and (6.0, 0.0)\n- Input inserters at (0.5, -1.5), (2.5, -1.5), (4.5, -1.5), and (6.5, -1.5)\n- Output inserters at (0.5, 1.5), (2.5, 1.5), (4.5, 1.5), and (6.5, 1.5)\n- Input coal storage chests at (0.5, -2.5), (2.5, -2.5), (4.5, -2.5), and (6.5, -2.5)\n- Output iron plate storage chests at (0.5, 2.5), (2.5, 2.5), (4.5, 2.5), and (6.5, 2.5)\n\n### Copper Mining Setup (In Progress)\n- Single burner mining drill at (-28.0, -61.0)\nCurrently incomplete as the agent is trying to expand this structure\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Inventory Management Errors\n- Ensure required items are crafted or available in inventory before attempting to place entities\n- Example: Attempting to place burner-mining-drill without having it in inventory\n\n### Entity Placement Errors\n- Check if target location is clear before placing entities\n- Example: Attempting to place stone-furnace where another entity or item is blocking the location\n- Ensure proper spacing between entities considering their tile dimensions\n\n### Structure Planning\n- Plan the complete structure layout before starting construction to avoid placement conflicts\n- Consider the space requirements for all components (drills, furnaces, inserters, chests) when designing mining/production setups"}
