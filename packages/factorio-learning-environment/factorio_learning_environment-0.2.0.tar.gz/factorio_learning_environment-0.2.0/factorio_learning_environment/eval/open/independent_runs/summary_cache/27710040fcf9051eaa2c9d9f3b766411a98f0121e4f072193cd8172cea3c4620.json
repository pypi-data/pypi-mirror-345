{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Coal Mining Setup at Position (41.0, -82.0)\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (41.0, -82.0): Extracts coal from the ground.\n- **Transport Belts** at positions (41.5, -80.5) and (41.5, -81.5): Transports coal from the drill to other structures.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (41.5, -80.5): Moves coal from the transport belt to the drill for refueling.\n\n#### Stone Furnace at Position (-13.0, -50.0)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-13.0, -50.0): Used for smelting ores into plates. Currently idle due to lack of ingredients.\n\n#### Belt Group at Position (43.5, -80.5)\n- **Transport Belts**: \n  - Input belt at (43.5, -80.5) to (45.5, -80.5), direction RIGHT.\n  - Output belt at (43.5, -77.5) to (42.5, -78.5), direction UP.\n- **Inventory**: Contains 35 coal.\n- **Status**: Working, transporting coal.\n\n---\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Ensure the target tile is free before placing entities like transport belts or burner inserters. Clear obstructions (e.g., items on the ground or existing entities) before attempting placement.\n\n#### Errors when connecting entities with transport belts\n- Verify the path between entities is clear and valid before connecting them with transport belts. Ensure the belt path does not collide with other entities or terrain.\n\n#### Errors when placing burner inserters\n- Avoid placing burner inserters near items on the ground or other entities. Adjust the spacing, direction, or reference position to avoid collisions.\n\n#### Errors when retrieving entities\n- Ensure the entity exists at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it. Double-check the entity type and position to avoid errors.\n\n#### Errors when placing burner mining drills\n- Clear obstructions at the target position before placing a burner mining drill. Ensure the drill is placed on a valid resource patch.\n\n#### General Tips\n- Always check for obstructions or collisions before placing or connecting entities.\n- Use the `clear_obstructions` function to remove blocking items or entities before placement.\n- Verify the direction and spacing when placing entities next to others to avoid placement errors."}
