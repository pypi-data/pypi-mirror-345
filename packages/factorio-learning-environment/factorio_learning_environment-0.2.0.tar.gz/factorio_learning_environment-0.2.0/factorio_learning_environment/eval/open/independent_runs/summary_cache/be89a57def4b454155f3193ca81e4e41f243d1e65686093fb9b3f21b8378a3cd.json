Always verify and use the current valid fluid_system (now [37948]) provided by the boiler or offshore pump.\n\u2500 Rigid Pipeline Stabilization:\n  \u2022 Rely on dynamic connectivity checks rather than fixed delays to ensure PipeGroup readiness before initiating connection attempts.\n\u2500 Persistently Failed Pipeline Connections:\n  \u2022 Confirm that source and target connection points are unobstructed and compatible to enable successful fluid transfer.\n\u2500 Fuel Supply Management:\n  \u2022 Ensure the boiler is sufficiently fueled to avoid entering a NO_FUEL state prior to pipeline connection attempts."}
