{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-13.5, 20.0)\nConsists of boiler (position -13.5, 20.0), steam engine (position not specified), and offshore pump (position -10.5, 25.5). The boiler is currently out of fuel and requires coal to generate steam.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(-18.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position not specified) and a furnace at position (-18.0, -49.0).\n\n### Iron plate factory at position(5.0, -73.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position not specified) and a furnace at position (5.0, -73.0).\n\n### Lab at position(not specified)\nConsists of a lab (position not specified) which is currently not receiving power.\n\n### Pipe system\nConsists of multiple pipe groups:\n- PipeGroup (fluid system 50557) at position (-11.5, 20.5) with full output status.\n- PipeGroup (fluid system 50559) at position (-4.5, 21.5) with empty status.\n- PipeGroup (fluid system 50561) at position (-4.5, 23.5) with empty status.\n\n### Electricity network\nConsists of multiple small electric poles:\n- Small electric pole at position (-15.5, 25.5) and nearby poles at positions (-15.5, 19.5), (-15.5, 18.5), and others.\n\n### Copper cable factory at position(not specified)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine at position (-21.5, 25.5) which is currently not receiving power.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when attempting to insert items without having them in inventory\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into other entities. In this case, coal is needed for the boiler.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors related to power supply\n- Ensure that all entities requiring power are connected to a power source to avoid 'no power' status."}
