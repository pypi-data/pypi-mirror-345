{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-5.0, 2.5)\nConsists of offshore pump (position -9.5, -0.5), boiler (position -5.0, 2.5), steam engine (position 0.5, 6.5), pipes connecting offshore pump to boiler and boiler to steam engine, and small electric poles connecting steam engine to other entities.\n\n### Coal mine at position(16.0, 0.0)\nConsists of burner mining drill (position 16.0, 0.0), wooden chest (position 16.5, 1.5) to collect coal, and burner inserter (position 17.5, 1.5) to take coal from chest.\n\n### Iron ore mine at position(15.5, 70.5)\nConsists of electric mining drill (position 19.5, 70.5), stone furnace (position 18.0, 68.0) to smelt iron ore, inserter (position 15.5, 68.5) to put iron ore into furnace, burner inserter (position 19.5, 68.5) to take iron plates from furnace, inserter (position 20.5, 68.5) to take iron plates from burner inserter, and output chest (position 21.5, 68.5).\n- Belt group connecting the electric mining drill to the inserter at position 15.5, 68.5\n- Belt group connecting the inserter at position 15.5, 68.5 to the burner inserter at position 19.5, 68.5\n- Belt group connecting the inserter at position 20.5, 68.5 to the output chest at position 21.5, 68.5\n\n### New Iron ore mine at position(18.5, 72.5)\nConsists of electric mining drill (position 18.5, 72.5), transport belt (position 18.5, 70.5) to take iron ore from the drill, and inserter at position(12.5, 70.5).\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting transport belts directly to a chest\n- Ensure that an inserter is used to take items from the chest before connecting to transport belts.\n\n### Errors when getting entities at a specific position\n- Ensure that the entity exists at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it.\n\n### Errors when placing entities next to an existing entity with insufficient spacing\n- Increase the spacing or change the direction when placing entities next to an existing entity.\n\n### Errors when placing entities at a position occupied by another entity\n- Ensure that the target position is not occupied by another entity before attempting to place an entity.\n\n### Errors when the target position is too far away to place an entity\n- Move closer to the target position before attempting to place an entity.\n\n### Errors when connecting entities with transport belts\n- Ensure that the drop position of the source entity is not occupied by another entity.\n\n### Errors related to power supply\n- Ensure that entities requiring power are connected to a power source and that the power source is functioning.\n\n### Errors due to undefined variables\n- Ensure that variables are defined before they are used.\n\n### Errors when attempting to retrieve a non-existent entity attribute\n- Verify that the attribute exists for the entity before attempting to retrieve it.\n\n### Errors when entities are not working due to lack of ingredients or fuel\n- Ensure that entities have the necessary ingredients or fuel to function.\n\n### Errors when inspecting inventory of entities\n- Not all entities support inventory inspection. Check the entity type before attempting to inspect its inventory.\n\n### Errors when extracting items from entities\n- Ensure that the entity contains the item you are trying to extract and that the entity is capable of holding that item.\n\n### Errors when attempting to access attributes of 'PipeGroup' or 'BeltGroup'\n- Verify that the attribute exists for the entity before attempting to retrieve it.\n\n### Errors when a variable is not defined before being used\n- Ensure that variables are defined before they are used.\n\n### Errors when accessing 'belts' attribute of a 'TransportBelt' object\n- Verify that the entity is a 'BeltGroup' before attempting to access its 'belts' attribute.\n\n### New error tips from the latest logs\n### Errors when output is blocked by item on the ground\n- Ensure that there is a clear path for the output and that there is a sink entity to accept the output.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n### Function signature: `get_connection_amount(belt_at_drop_position, inserter.pickup_position, connection_type=Prototype.TransportBelt)`\n- Description: This function is supposed to get the connection amount between a belt and an inserter.\n- Failure mode: No specific failure mode mentioned in the logs.\n- Success mode: No specific success mode mentioned in the logs.\n- Important variables: \n"}
