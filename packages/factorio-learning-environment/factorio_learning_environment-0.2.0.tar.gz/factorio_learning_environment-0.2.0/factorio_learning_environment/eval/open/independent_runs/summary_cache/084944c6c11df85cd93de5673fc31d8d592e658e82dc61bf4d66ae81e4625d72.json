{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\u2022 No new composite structures have been successfully placed on the map during these steps. Although operations to process resources were executed using pre\u2010existing furnaces (an iron furnace at (5.0, 5.0) and a copper furnace at (\u201327.0, \u201360.0)), these were not built by the agent.\n\u2022 Multiple attempts were made to locate, craft, and place a Lab at (0.5, 2.5) for supplying Automation Science Packs for research, but none of these attempts succeeded due to resource shortages and placement failures.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 API Usage Errors for get_entities:\n\u2003\u2013 Do not pass unsupported keyword arguments (e.g., \u201cradius\u201d) or extraneous positional arguments. Confirm the expected signature before invoking.\n\u2022 Lab Placement and Crafting Failures:\n\u2003\u2013 Verify that the Lab is available in the inventory before attempting to place it.\n\u2003\u2013 Ensure all required sub-ingredients (such as iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, and copper-cables) are available before initiating Lab crafting.\n\u2022 Handling Non-Iterable Returns:\n\u2003\u2013 When filtering entities (e.g., via list comprehensions), check that the source is iterable. Implement fallbacks to convert any None returns to an empty list.\n\u2022 Resource Availability Checks:\n\u2003\u2013 Pre-assess and secure sufficient resources (including smelted outputs and intermediate products) to meet the complete requirements for crafting complex items like the Lab before beginning production."}
