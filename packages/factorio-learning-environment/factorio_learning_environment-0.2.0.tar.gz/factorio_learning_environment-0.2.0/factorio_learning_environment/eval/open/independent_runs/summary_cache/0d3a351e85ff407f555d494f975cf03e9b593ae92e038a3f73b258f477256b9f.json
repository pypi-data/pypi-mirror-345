{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Ore Mine at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position: (-15.0, -50.0))\n- Wooden chest (position: (-14.5, -48.5))\n- Burner inserter (position: (-13.5, -48.5))\n- Burner inserter (position: (-12.5, -48.5))\n\n#### Iron Smelting Setup at position (52.0, -79.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position: (52.0, -79.0))\n- Burner inserter (position: (53.5, -79.5))\n- Wooden chest (position: (54.5, -79.5))\n- Burner inserter (position: (55.5, -78.5))\n- Wooden chest (position: (56.5, -78.5))\n\n#### Coal Storage at position (41.5, -80.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest (position: (41.5, -80.5))\n- Wooden chest (position: (43.5, -80.5))\n- Burner inserter (position: (42.5, -80.5))\n\n#### General Storage at position (0.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest (position: (0.5, 0.5))\n- Wooden chest (position: (1.5, 0.5))\n- Wooden chest (position: (2.5, 0.5))\n- Wooden chest (position: (3.5, 0.5))\n- Wooden chest (position: (4.5, 0.5))\n- Wooden chest (position: (5.5, 0.5))\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when the burner mining drill is not working\n- Ensure the burner mining drill has sufficient fuel (coal) to operate.\n- Check the status of the chest at the drop position to ensure it is not full. Empty the chest if necessary to allow the drill to continue mining.\n\n#### Errors when the burner inserter is out of fuel\n- Ensure all burner inserters have sufficient fuel (coal) to operate. Insert coal into the inserter's fuel inventory if it is empty.\n\n#### Errors when the furnace has no ingredients to smelt\n- Ensure the furnace has the necessary raw materials (e.g., iron ore) and fuel (coal) to perform smelting. Use inserters to supply the furnace with the required items.\n\n#### Errors when the inserter is waiting for source items\n- Ensure the inserter has access to the items it needs to pick up. Check the source chest or entity to ensure it contains the required items.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n#### Utility Functions\n- None defined yet.\n\n#### Important Variables\n- `drill`: Represents a burner mining drill entity.\n- `drill.position`: Position of the burner mining drill (type: Position).\n- `drill.status`: Status of the burner mining drill (type: EntityStatus)."}
