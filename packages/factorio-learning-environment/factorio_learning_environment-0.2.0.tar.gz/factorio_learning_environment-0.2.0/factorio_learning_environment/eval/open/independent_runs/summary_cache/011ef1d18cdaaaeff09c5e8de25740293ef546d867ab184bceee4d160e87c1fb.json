{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Transport System at (-41, -80)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0) mining coal\n- Transport belt system running east:\n  - Belt at (41.5, -80.5) \u2192 RIGHT\n  - Belt at (42.5, -80.5) \u2192 RIGHT\n  - Belt at (43.5, -80.5) \u2192 RIGHT\n  - Belt at (44.5, -80.5) \u2192 RIGHT\n- Burner inserter at (45.5, -80.5) picking up from (44.5, -80.5) and dropping at (46.5, -80.5)\n- Stone furnace at (48.0, -80.0)\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Errors\n- Cannot place entities where other entities already exist. The agent tried placing a furnace at positions that were already occupied\n- Ensure target placement locations are clear of other entities before attempting to place new ones\n\n### System Design Issues\n- The furnace and inserter positions are not properly aligned, causing the inserter to be unable to properly feed the furnace\n- When building automated systems, carefully plan the relative positions of connected entities to ensure they can interact properly\n- Pay attention to the pickup and drop positions of inserters relative to the input positions of target entities\n\n### Belt System Issues\n- Transport belt at mining drill output position (41.5, -80.5) gets blocked, preventing continuous mining operation\n- Ensure the entire logistics chain has proper flow and items can be removed from the end of the system\n\n# NAMESPACE\n\n### Important Variables\n- `furnace`: EntityHandle (stone-furnace)\n- `mining_drill`: EntityHandle (burner-mining-drill) \n- `inserter`: EntityHandle (burner-inserter)\n- `belt_group`: BeltGroup containing multiple transport belts\n\n### System States\n- Mining drill status: WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION\n- Inserter status: WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION\n- Belt group status: WORKING\n- Furnace status: NO_INGREDIENTS"}
