{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nCurrently, there are no structures on the map. All attempts to place entities such as Burner Mining Drills and Stone Furnaces have failed, resulting in no structures being established.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when finding buildable spots\n- Ensure there is enough space for the BuildingBox of the entity you wish to place. Consider decreasing the size of the BuildingBox or using multiple smaller BuildingBoxes to find a viable spot.\n\n### Errors when placing entities at desired locations\n- Verify that the desired location is suitable for placing the entity. Ensure the tile is not occupied and that the position is within the buildable area.\n\n### Errors in moving to positions\n- When using the move_to function, ensure that the indices used are integers. Avoid using strings as indices.\n\n### NameError in code\n- Ensure that all variables are defined before use. Double-check for typos in variable names and ensure that the correct variable is being referenced.\n\n### General placement errors\n- Double-check the positions where you intend to place entities like Burner Mining Drills and Stone Furnaces. Make sure the positions are valid and that the entities can be placed without obstruction."}
