{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnaces**:\n  - Stone furnace at position (x=-16.0, y=-49.0) with no ingredients to smelt, containing 56 iron plates.\n  - Stone furnace at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- **Inserters**:\n  - Burner inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-47.5) waiting for source items.\n  - Burner inserter at position (x=-14.5, y=-45.5) waiting for source items.\n  - Burner inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-45.5) waiting for source items.\n  - Burner inserter at position (x=-11.5, y=-45.5) waiting for source items.\n  - Burner inserter at position (x=-14.5, y=-43.5) waiting for source items.\n- **Chests**:\n  - Wooden chest at position (x=-13.5, y=-46.5).\n  - Wooden chest at position (x=-13.5, y=-44.5) containing 187 iron ore and 1160 iron plates.\n  - Iron chest at position (x=-11.5, y=-44.5).\n\n### Belt System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Belts**:\n  - Belt from (x=-16.5, y=-48.5) to (x=-16.5, y=-46.5) directing downwards.\n  - Belt from (x=-14.5, y=-45.5) to (x=-14.5, y=-47.5) directing upwards.\n  - Belt from (x=-14.5, y=-45.5) to (x=-14.5, y=-43.5) directing downwards.\n- **Belt Groups**:\n  - BeltGroup with inputs from (x=-11.5, y=-46.5) to (x=-9.5, y=-46.5) and outputs from (x=-8.5, y=-45.5) to (x=-8.5, y=-43.5).\n  - BeltGroup with inputs from (x=-12.5, y=-44.5) to (x=-12.5, y=-46.5) and outputs from (x=-12.5, y=-45.5) to (x=-11.5, y=-46.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using inserters with no source items\n- Ensure that the inserters have access to source items. Check if the source entities contain the necessary items for the inserters to pick up.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into a full belt\n- Verify that the belt has available space before attempting to insert items. If the belt is full, consider upgrading the belt or clearing the existing items to make space.\n\n### Errors when attempting to insert items without inventory\n- Before attempting to insert items, ensure that the required items are present in your inventory. Regularly check and replenish your inventory as needed."}
