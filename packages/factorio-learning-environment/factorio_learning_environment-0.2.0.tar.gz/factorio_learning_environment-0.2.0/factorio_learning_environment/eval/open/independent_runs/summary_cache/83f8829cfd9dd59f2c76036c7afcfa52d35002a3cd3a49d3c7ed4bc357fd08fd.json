{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generation at Position(x=-9.5, y=-0.5) to (x=19.5, y=6.5)\nThis structure generates electricity using steam power. The boiler has been refueled multiple times but ran out again. The steam engine has been connected to the power network, but the network itself is currently unpowered as the boiler lacks fuel.\n*   Offshore Pump at (x=-9.5, y=-0.5) - Status: WORKING\n*   Pipes connecting the pump to the boiler (PipeGroup starting at x=-8.5, y=-0.5) - Status: FULL_OUTPUT (water)\n*   Boiler at (x=-5.0, y=2.5) - Status: NO_FUEL\n*   Pipes connecting the boiler to the steam engine (PipeGroup starting at x=-6.5, y=3.5) - Status: WORKING (steam)\n*   Steam Engine (Generator) at (x=0.5, y=6.5) - Status: WORKING (but network unpowered), connected to pole at (x=0.5, y=4.5).\n*   Power poles placed near the steam engine (ElectricityGroup id=26967, poles at x=0.5, y=4.5; x=4.5, y=4.5; x=8.5, y=4.5; x=12.5, y=4.5; x=16.5, y=4.5; x=19.5, y=5.5) - Currently unpowered (voltage=0).\n\n### Iron Gear Wheel Assembly Area at Position (x=23.5, y=12.5) to (x=26.5, y=19.5)\nThis area contains the components for assembling iron gear wheels from iron plates. These components are currently unpowered and lack input materials."}
