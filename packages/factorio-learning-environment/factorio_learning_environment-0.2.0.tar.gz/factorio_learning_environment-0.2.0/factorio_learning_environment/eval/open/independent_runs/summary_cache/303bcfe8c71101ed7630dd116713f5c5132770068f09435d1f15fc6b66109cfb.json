{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, -0.5)\n- Boiler at (-5.5, 0.0)\n- Steam engine at (-1.5, 0.5)\n- Connected by pipes forming a complete power generation system\n\n### Iron Mining and Smelting Operation at (25.5, 70.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill at (25.5, 70.5) extracting iron ore\n- Stone furnace at (26.0, 74.0) for smelting\n- Inserter at (25.5, 72.5) connecting the drill to furnace\n- Powered by nearby small electric poles\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Belt connection errors (repeated in steps 8,9,10,11)\n- Transport belts cannot be connected directly to furnaces - always use an inserter as intermediary\n- Ensure belt paths are valid before attempting connections - check for obstacles and proper alignment\n- Verify inserter drop positions are clear before connecting belts (common conflict with furnaces)\n\n### Entity placement errors (steps 12,13)\n- Check terrain before placing mining drills - cannot place on water or occupied tiles\n- Verify target location is clear and buildable before attempting placement\n\n### Mining operation issues\n- Ensure mining drills have clear output paths - blocked outputs halt production\n- Verify inserter positions correctly bridge between miners and furnaces\n- Maintain fuel supply to furnaces for continuous operation\n\n### Power system considerations\n- Maintain proper pipe connections between offshore pumps, boilers and steam engines\n- Keep fuel supplied to boilers for continuous operation\n\n### Code implementation errors (step 15)\n- Import required modules (like 'math') before using their functions\n- Verify all variables are properly defined before use in calculations\n\n### General placement strategy (step 14)\n- Implement proper error handling when no suitable build location is found\n- Consider scanning nearby areas when primary location is unavailable"}
