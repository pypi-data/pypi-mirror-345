Initial attempts used fluid_system IDs [2172, 2215, 2258, 2301, 2344, 2387, 2430, 2473]. Newer attempts with fluid_system IDs [2516, 2559, 2602, 2645, 2688, 2731, 2774, 2817] via a two-segment pipeline have also been aborted due to obstructions and the absence of a valid working PipeGroup, leaving the connection incomplete.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 PipeGroup Availability and Merge Failures:\n   - Validate the existence of a working PipeGroup before each connection attempt. Repeated failures with fluid_system IDs [2172, 2215, 2258, 2301, 2344, 2387, 2430, 2473] and [2516, 2559, 2602, 2645, 2688, 2731, 2774, 2817] call for pre-validation of the fluid network\u2019s readiness.\n   \n\u2022 Pipe Placement Obstructions:\n   - Ensure that target connection points, such as (0.0, 21.5) and (0.5, 21.5), are free from existing objects before placing pipes. Adjust offsets or clear the area to avoid placement conflicts.\n   \n\u2022 Multi-Segment Pipeline Connection Challenges:\n   - Confirm that intermediate waypoints in two-segment pipelines align correctly with both source and target endpoints. Re-validate each segment\u2019s placement to secure uninterrupted connectivity.\n   \n\u2022 General Connection and Repositioning:\n   - Verify that both source and target connection endpoints are within allowed ranges and free of obstructions before initiating merge attempts."}
