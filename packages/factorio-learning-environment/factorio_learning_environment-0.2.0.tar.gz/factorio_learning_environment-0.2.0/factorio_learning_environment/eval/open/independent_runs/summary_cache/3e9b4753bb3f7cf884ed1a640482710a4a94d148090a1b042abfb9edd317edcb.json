{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Structure at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nThis structure is designed to mine and process iron ore. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Responsible for extracting iron ore from the ground. It is fueled with coal.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores the mined iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-15.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the stone furnace. It is fueled with coal.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates. Currently, it is not receiving iron ore due to misalignment issues with the inserter.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Inserter Alignment\n- Ensure that the inserter's pickup position is correctly aligned with the chest containing the iron ore. Misalignment will prevent the inserter from transferring items.\n- Verify that the inserter's drop position is correctly aligned with the furnace to ensure the iron ore is delivered for smelting.\n\n### Errors in Placing Entities\n- Before placing an entity, check for potential collisions with existing entities. Adjust the spacing or change the direction or reference position if necessary to avoid placement errors.\n- Ensure there is no obstruction, such as water or other entities, in the intended placement area.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Resources\n- Ensure that you have the necessary resources, such as coal, in your inventory before attempting to refuel entities like mining drills or inserters."}
