{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal\n  - Status: Working\n  - Smelting iron ore into iron plates\n- **Burner Inserter 1** at position (1.5, 0.5)\n  - Direction: Right\n  - Transfers iron plates from the furnace to the chest\n  - Pickup Position: (0.5, 0.5)\n  - Drop Position: (2.5, 0.5)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (2.5, 0.5)\n  - Stores iron plates transferred by the inserter\n- **Burner Inserter 2** at position (4.5, 0.5)\n  - Direction: Left\n  - Currently waiting for source items\n  - Pickup Position: (5.5, 0.5)\n  - Drop Position: (3.5, 0.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities without having them in inventory\n- Ensure you have the required entity in your inventory before attempting to place it. For example, placing a burner inserter failed due to it not being in the inventory.\n\n### Errors when crafting without required ingredients\n- Verify that you have all necessary ingredients before crafting an item. Crafting transport belts failed due to missing iron plates.\n\n### Errors when connecting belts directly from a chest\n- Use an inserter to take items from a chest before connecting them with belts. Direct belt connections from a wooden chest are not possible.\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied tiles\n- Check the target tile for other entities before placing a new entity. Adjust spacing or direction if needed to avoid overlap. For example, placing a burner inserter failed due to an existing inserter at the intended position.\n\n### Errors when inserting items without having them in inventory\n- Ensure you have the items you wish to insert into an entity in your inventory. Attempting to insert coal into a burner inserter failed due to lack of coal in the inventory."}
