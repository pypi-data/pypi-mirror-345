{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Consists of a stone furnace with the following attributes:\n  - Fuel: Coal (12 units)\n  - Energy: 1600.0\n  - Tile Dimensions: 2.0 x 2.0\n  - Status: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Furnace Result: Iron Plate (13 units)\n\n### Offshore Pump at Position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Consists of an offshore pump with the following attributes:\n  - Direction: Up\n  - Energy: 0.0\n  - Tile Dimensions: 1.0 x 1.0\n  - Status: Not connected\n  - Connection Points: Position (-9.5, 23.5)\n\n### Lab\n- Consists of a lab with the following attributes:\n  - Lab Input: Automation Science Pack (10 units)\n  - Status: No power\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Type Errors with Boiler Dimensions\n- Ensure that when performing arithmetic operations with boiler dimensions, the operands are of compatible types. Convert `ModelPrivateAttr` to a numeric type before performing operations.\n\n### Attribute Errors with Boiler Tile Dimensions\n- Verify that the `Prototype.Boiler.entity_class` has the `tile_dimensions` attribute. Ensure the correct attribute name is used and that it exists in the class definition.\n\n### Type Errors with Conversion to Float\n- When converting `boiler_width` and `boiler_height` to float, ensure that the attributes are strings or real numbers. Check the data type before conversion to avoid `TypeError`.\n\n### General Tips\n- Always validate the data types and existence of attributes before performing operations or conversions to prevent runtime errors.\n- Ensure all entities are correctly connected and powered to avoid warnings and status issues like \"no power\" or \"not connected\"."}
