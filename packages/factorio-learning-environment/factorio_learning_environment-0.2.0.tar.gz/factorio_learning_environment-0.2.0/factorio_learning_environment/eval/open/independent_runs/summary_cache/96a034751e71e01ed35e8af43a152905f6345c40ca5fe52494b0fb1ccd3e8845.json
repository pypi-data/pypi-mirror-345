{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0) with fuel inventory containing coal. It is currently working but has a warning that the output is blocked by an item on the ground, indicating there is no sink entity to accept the output.\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0) with a fuel inventory containing coal. The furnace has a warning indicating 'no ingredients to smelt', which means it is not currently processing any materials.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied locations\n- Ensure the target location is clear before attempting to place entities such as Transport Belts, Burner Inserters, Wooden Chests, and Stone Furnaces. Repeated errors indicate attempts to place these items at occupied or invalid positions.\n\n### Errors when moving entities to occupied locations\n- Verify that the destination location for moving entities like Stone Furnaces is unoccupied and suitable for placement.\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities\n- Ensure the entity exists at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it. Errors were encountered when trying to access a Stone Furnace at a position where it was not found.\n\n### Output Blockage Warnings\n- Address the warning from the Burner Mining Drill about the output being blocked. Ensure there is a sink entity or a clear path for the output to be processed or transported away.\n\n### No Ingredients to Smelt Warning\n- Ensure the Stone Furnace has the necessary ingredients to process. The warning indicates it lacks materials to smelt, which halts production."}
