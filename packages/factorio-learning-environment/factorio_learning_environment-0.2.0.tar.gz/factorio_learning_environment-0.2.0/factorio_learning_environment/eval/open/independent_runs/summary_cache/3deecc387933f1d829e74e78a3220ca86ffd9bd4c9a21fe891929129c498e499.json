{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (6 units)\n  - Status: Waiting for space in destination\n  - Warnings: Output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Neighbours: Stone Furnace at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)\n  - Drop Position: (x=-16.5, y=-52.5)\n  - Resources: Iron Ore (39,998 units)\n\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (14 units)\n  - Status: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Furnace Source: Empty\n  - Furnace Result: Iron Plate (60 units)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Entity Placement\n- **Cannot Place at Desired Location**: Ensure that the tile is unoccupied and suitable for the entity you wish to place. Check for obstructions or incorrect positioning before attempting to place entities like Stone Furnace, Wooden Chest, Burner Inserter, and Transport Belt.\n\n### Errors When Using Extracting but Being Too Far\n- **Could Not Get Prototype at Position**: Make sure to move closer to the target entity where you want to extract or interact with before executing the command. This applies to entities like Stone Furnace.\n\n### Inventory Management Errors\n- **No Coal to Insert**: Ensure that you have the necessary resources in your inventory before attempting to insert items into entities like drills. Keep track of your inventory levels to avoid such errors.\n\n### General Tips\n- **Clearing Items from Drill's Drop Position**: Regularly clear items from the drill's drop position to prevent output blockage and ensure continuous operation.\n- **Refueling**: Regularly refuel entities like the Burner Mining Drill to maintain operational efficiency.\n- **Warnings and Status Checks**: Pay attention to warnings and status messages from entities to address issues like blocked outputs or missing ingredients promptly."}
