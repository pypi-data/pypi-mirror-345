Ensure that a fuel source is provided to these entities.\n* **No ingredients**: The stone furnace at position (60.0, -60.0) is not functioning due to a lack of ingredients. Ensure that the necessary ingredients are provided to this entity.\n* **Not connected**: The steam engine is not connected to a power source. Ensure that the steam engine is connected to a power source, such as a boiler.\n* **Not plugged in electric network**: The electricity group is not plugged into an electric network. Ensure that the electricity group is connected to an electric network.\n* **Empty**: The pipe group and belt group are empty. Ensure that these entities are filled with the necessary items.\n* **Waiting for source items**: The burner inserter is waiting for source items. Ensure that the necessary items are provided to this entity.\n\n# NAMESPACE\nThe agent has defined the following utility functions:\n* None\n\nThe agent has assigned the following variables:\n* None \n\nNote: The report is based on the provided execution logs and may not be comprehensive or entirely accurate.
