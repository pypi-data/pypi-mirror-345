{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal and Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nThis structure is responsible for mining coal and iron ore and processing them into iron plates.\n\n- **Coal Mining and Processing:**\n  - **Burner Mining Drill** at position (41.0, -82.0) connected to:\n    - **Stone Furnace** at position (43.0, -82.0)\n    - **Iron Chest** at position (41.5, -80.5)\n  - **Burner Inserter** at position (43.5, -80.5) waiting for source items, connected to the stone furnace at (43.0, -82.0).\n\n- **Iron Ore Mining and Processing:**\n  - **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) connected to:\n    - **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5)\n    - **Stone Furnace** at position (-13.0, -48.0)\n  - **Stone Furnaces** at positions:\n    - (-13.0, -48.0)\n    - (-11.0, -48.0)\n    - (-9.0, -48.0)\n  - **Burner Inserters** at positions:\n    - (-14.5, -46.5) waiting for source items\n    - (-14.5, -45.5) waiting for source items\n\n### Storage Facilities\n- **Iron Chest** at position (41.5, -80.5) for coal storage.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5) for iron ore storage.\n- **Iron Chest** at position (-14.5, -47.5) for processed materials.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors when connecting entities directly\n- When connecting belts or other transport mechanisms, ensure that you are using the correct intermediary entities such as inserters. For example, belts cannot be connected directly from a chest; use an inserter to transfer items from the chest to the belt.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient inventory items\n- Ensure that you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to place or craft entities. For example, attempting to place a burner inserter without having one in your inventory will result in an error. Gather or craft the required items beforehand.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient crafting materials\n- Before attempting to craft new items, check that you have sufficient materials. For crafting burner inserters, ensure you have enough iron plates and gear wheels. Collect additional resources if needed.\n\n### Errors due to full chests\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are used as drop-off points for mining drills to prevent them from becoming full and halting production. For instance, empty the chest at (41.5, -80.5) and (-14.5, -48.5) to continue mining operations.\n\n### Errors due to no ingredients to smelt\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. If a furnace is showing a \"no ingredients to smelt\" warning, check the supply chain to ensure that raw materials are being delivered to the furnace."}
