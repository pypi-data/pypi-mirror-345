Always introduce an inserter intermediary so that the belt feeds into an appropriate input, not directly into a Prototype.SteamEngine.\n\n\u2022 Inserter Placement Conflicts:\n  - Prevent placement collisions by verifying that a burner inserter does not already exist in the intended location. Adjust spacing, change the placement direction, or modify the reference position to ensure compatibility.\n\n\u2022 Placement Range and Inventory Verification:\n  - Ensure that target positions for placing entities, such as wooden chests, are within the allowable range (relative to the player\u2019s current position). Additionally, verify that the necessary entity is available in the inventory before attempting placement.\n\n\u2022 Variable Reference Consistency:\n  - Double-check variable names (for example, avoiding undefined references like \u201ctarget_chest\u201d) to prevent NameErrors. Confirm that all variables are correctly defined before use."}
