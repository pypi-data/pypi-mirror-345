{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-12.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-12.0, -48.0), which is currently working and fueled with coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -46.5) containing iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-14.5, -47.5) transferring items from the chest to the furnace.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-10.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-10.0, -48.0), which is currently not working due to lack of ingredients and fueled with coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-7.5, -47.5).\n- Burner Inserter at position (-8.5, -47.5) waiting for source items to transfer to the furnace.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0), actively mining iron ore and fueled with coal.\n- Wooden Chests at positions (-15.5, -48.5) and (-14.5, -48.5) for storing mined resources.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -48.5) transferring items from the mining drill to the chests.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Inventory Full\n- Ensure that the furnaces have enough space in their output inventory before attempting to insert more items. Regularly extract items from the furnace to prevent overflow.\n\n### Errors when Inserting Items without Inventory\n- Always check your inventory for the required items before attempting to insert them into entities. Ensure you have the necessary resources in your inventory to perform the action.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the inserters have access to items to transfer. Check the source entities to confirm they contain items that need to be moved. Regularly monitor and refill resources to maintain a continuous workflow."}
