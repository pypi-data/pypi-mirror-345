{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) with coal as fuel, extracting iron ore. It is connected to:\n  - **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5) and another at (-15.5, -48.5) for storing extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5), transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0), fueled by coal, smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-14.5, -47.5), awaiting source items for further processing.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items without available resources\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into an entity. For example, attempting to insert coal without having it in the inventory will result in an error.\n\n### Errors due to undefined variables\n- Double-check variable names before using them in functions. Ensure that all variables are defined and correctly referenced to avoid `NameError`.\n\n### Errors due to missing ingredients or fuel in the furnace\n- Regularly check the fuel and ingredient levels in the furnace to ensure continuous production. Refuel and restock ingredients as needed to prevent production halts.\n\n### Errors when mining drill output is blocked\n- Ensure that the chest at the mining drill's drop position is not full to allow continuous mining. Regularly empty the chest to maintain the flow of resources."}
