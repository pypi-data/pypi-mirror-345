# associative_array

An [abstract data type](/data_md/computer_science/definitions/data_structure/abstract_data_type.md) that [maps](/data_md/computer_science/definitions/data_structure/map.md) keys to values. It is a [collection](/data_md/computer_science/definitions/data_structure/collection.md) of key-value pairs, where each key is unique and is used to access the corresponding value. Associative arrays are also known as maps, dictionaries, or hash tables.
Associative arrays allow for efficient [operations](/data_md/computer_science/definitions/foundamental/operation.md): retrieval, insertion, and deletion of values based on their keys.
