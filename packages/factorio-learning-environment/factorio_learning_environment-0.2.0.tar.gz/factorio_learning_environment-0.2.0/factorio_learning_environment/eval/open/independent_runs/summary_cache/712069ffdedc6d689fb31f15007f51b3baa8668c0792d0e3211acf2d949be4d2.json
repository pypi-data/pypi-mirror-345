{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generation System\n- **Offshore Pump** at position (x=-47.5, y=-123.5) supplying water.\n- **Pipe Group** connecting the offshore pump to various points, including positions (x=-47.5, y=-122.5) and (x=-40.5, y=-113.5).\n- **Electricity Group** with poles at positions such as (x=8.5, y=-57.5) and (x=-37.5, y=-115.5), though not all connections are successfully established.\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-76.0) extracting iron ore, with a **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-15.5, y=-77.5) for storage.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (x=-19.0, y=-73.0), (x=9.0, y=-64.0), and (x=6.0, y=-62.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates. Note: Furnaces are currently not smelting due to lack of ingredients.\n\n### Inserter and Storage System\n- **Inserter** at position (x=6.5, y=-60.5) intended to move items between entities, currently not operational due to lack of power.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (x=7.5, y=-61.5) and (x=6.5, y=-59.5) for storing iron plates and other resources.\n\n### Research Lab\n- **Lab** with input for automation science packs, currently not operational due to lack of power.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities\n- Ensure the target location for placing entities like steam engines is clear of obstructions before attempting placement.\n\n### Errors in Connecting to Power Network\n- Verify that you have the necessary items, such as small electric poles, in your inventory before attempting to connect entities to the power network.\n\n### Errors in Inventory Management\n- Regularly check your inventory to ensure you have the required items, such as coal, before attempting to insert them into machines or drills.\n\n### Errors in Resource Management\n- Monitor the status of storage chests to prevent them from becoming full, which can halt mining operations. Regularly empty or manage the inventory of chests to maintain continuous operation."}
