{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Smelting Area\nConsists of four stone furnaces:\n- Furnace 1 at position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Furnace 2 at position (2.0, 0.0)\n- Furnace 3 at position (4.0, 4.0)\n- Furnace 4 at position (6.0, 4.0)\nAll furnaces are currently idle with no ingredients but have coal fuel\n\n### Power Generation System\nLocated around position (-2.5, 24.0), consists of:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Boiler at position (-2.5, 24.0)\n- Steam engine at position (4.5, 24.5)\n- Connected by two pipe groups:\n  - Water input pipes from pump to boiler\n  - Steam output pipes from boiler to engine\n- Electric pole network connecting power to lab\n\n### Research Lab\n- Lab at position (10.5, 0.5)\n- Connected to power grid\n- Contains 2 automation science packs\n- Currently researching automation technology\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inventory Management Errors\n- Ensure required materials are in inventory before attempting to craft or place entities\n- Check recipes and gather all required raw materials before starting crafting chains\n\n### Entity Placement Errors\n- Cannot place entities without having them in inventory first (e.g., offshore pump placement failed)\n- Ensure proper connection of fluid-carrying entities with pipes\n\n### Crafting System Errors\n- Many items cannot be crafted by hand and require proper production facilities:\n  - Plates (iron/copper) require smelting in furnaces\n  - Electronic components require assembling machines\n- Plan production chains by checking recipe requirements first\n\n### Power System Errors\n- Ensure all components of power system are properly fueled (boiler needs coal)\n- Connect power poles to create complete electrical networks\n- Power-consuming entities need to be within range of power poles\n\n### Resource Gathering\n- Some resources like wood can only be gathered directly from the environment\n- Maintain adequate fuel (coal) supplies for furnaces and boilers"}
