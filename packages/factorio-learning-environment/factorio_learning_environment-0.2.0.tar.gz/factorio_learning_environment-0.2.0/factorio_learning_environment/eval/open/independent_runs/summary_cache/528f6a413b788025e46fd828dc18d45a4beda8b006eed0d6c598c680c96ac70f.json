{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-11.5, 18.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position -11.5, 18.5), boiler (position -11.5, 25.0), and offshore pump (position -9.5, 24.5). The steam engine is responsible for converting steam into electricity, while the boiler heats water to produce steam using fuel, and the offshore pump provides water to the boiler.\n\n### Pipe network\nConsists of multiple pipes connecting the boiler and offshore pump, including:\n- Pipe at position (-12.5, 15.5)\n- Pipe at position (-13.5, 15.5)\n- Pipe at position (-10.5, 15.5)\n- Pipe at position (-11.5, 15.5)\n- Pipe at position (-9.5, 15.5)\n- Pipe at position (-13.5, 16.5)\n- Pipe at position (-9.5, 16.5)\n- Pipe at position (-13.5, 20.5)\n- Pipe at position (-13.5, 21.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when attempting to connect boiler to offshore pump\n- Ensure that the positions of the boiler and offshore pump are within the correct range for pipe connections. Check the layout to confirm that there are no obstructions preventing the connection.\n\n### Errors when using pipes incorrectly\n- Verify that the pipes are placed correctly and are not overlapping with other entities. Ensure that the pipes are connected in a way that allows fluid to flow from the offshore pump to the boiler.\n\n### Errors when entities are not connected\n- Regularly inspect the status of connected entities to ensure they are properly linked. If an entity shows a status of NOT_CONNECTED, troubleshoot the connections and reposition entities if necessary."}
