{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5).\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Transport System at Position (-23.0, -68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) connected to a series of Transport Belts and a Wooden Chest at position (-23.5, -69.5).\n- Transport Belts connecting positions from (-24.5, -69.5) to (-21.5, -66.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -70.0) and another at (-18.0, -70.0) for smelting with no ingredients currently.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-20.5, -66.5) and Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -65.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-16.5, -64.5).\n- Transport Belts connecting various positions for material movement.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage Facility at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) connected to Wooden Chests at positions (-14.5, -54.5) and (-12.5, -54.5).\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5) facilitating transfer between chests.\n\n### Miscellaneous Storage and Transport\n- Multiple Wooden Chests at various positions for storage.\n- Several Belt Groups facilitating transport of materials between different sections.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Transport Belts\n- Ensure continuous placement of transport belts without gaps. The error indicates a gap detected at position (-19.5, -66.5). Verify the alignment and connectivity of belts before attempting to connect them.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entities have items available for the inserters to pick up. Check the inventory of connected entities to ensure they contain the necessary items for the inserters to function.\n\n### Errors with Furnaces Having No Ingredients\n- Ensure that the furnaces are supplied with the necessary raw materials for smelting. Verify the input sources and ensure they are connected and operational.\n\n### Errors with Mining Drills Out of Fuel\n- Regularly check the fuel levels of mining drills to ensure continuous operation. Refill drills with the appropriate fuel as needed to avoid interruptions in mining activities."}
