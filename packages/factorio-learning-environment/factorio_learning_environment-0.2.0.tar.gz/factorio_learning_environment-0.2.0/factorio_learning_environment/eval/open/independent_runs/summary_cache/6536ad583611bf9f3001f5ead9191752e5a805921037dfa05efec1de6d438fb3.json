{"content": "# Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\nAs of the current steps, no structures have been successfully created on the map. The logs indicate attempts to place various entities such as Wooden Chests, Transport Belts, Stone Furnaces, and Burner Inserters, but these attempts have been unsuccessful. Consequently, there are no existing structures to report.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- **Cannot place a Wooden Chest**: Ensure the target tile is unoccupied and suitable for placement before attempting to place a Wooden Chest. Errors occurred at positions (40.5, -82.5), (50.0, -90.0), (0.0, 0.0), and (100.0, -150.0).\n- **Cannot place a Transport Belt**: Verify that the tile is clear and appropriate for a Transport Belt before placement. Errors occurred at positions (45.0, -85.0) and (65.0, -105.0).\n- **Cannot place a Stone Furnace**: Confirm that the location is valid and unoccupied for placing a Stone Furnace. Error occurred at position (5.0, 5.0).\n- **Cannot place a Burner Inserter**: Check that the placement area is suitable and not obstructed for a Burner Inserter. Error occurred at position (-50.0, 50.0).\n\nTo mitigate these errors, always ensure that the intended placement area is clear of obstacles and suitable for the specific entity type. Consider using the map's visual feedback to confirm the availability of space before placing entities."}
