{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll generate a comprehensive report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Smelting Complex (around x=46, y=-81)\nMain smelting facility consisting of:\n- Two stone furnaces at (45.0, -81.0) and (47.0, -81.0)\n- Two burner inserters at (45.5, -82.5) and (47.5, -82.5) feeding the furnaces\n- Input wooden chest at (46.5, -83.5)\n- Distribution belt system:\n  - Center distribution belt at (46.5, -79.5)\n  - Left feed belt at (45.5, -79.5)\n  - Right feed belt at (47.5, -79.5)\n- Input system:\n  - Wooden chest at (46.5, -77.5) containing iron ore\n  - Two burner inserters at (46.5, -78.5) and (47.5, -78.5) for loading\n\n### Coal Mining Station (around x=41, y=-82)\n- Burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0)\n- Two iron chests at (41.5, -84.5) and (41.5, -83.5) containing coal\n- Storage chests:\n  - Wooden chest at (49.5, -80.5) containing 800 coal\n  - Wooden chest at (49.5, -79.5) containing coal and iron plates\n\nERROR TIPS\n1. Belt Placement Errors\n   - Ensure target location is clear before placing transport belts\n   - Check for existing entities that might block belt placement\n\n2. Missing Items Errors\n   - Verify required items (like splitters) are in inventory before attempting placement\n\n3. Entity Configuration Issues\n   - When reconfiguring inserters, ensure the new configuration is compatible with the surrounding setup\n   - Check that inserters have clear pickup and drop positions\n\n4. Resource Flow Issues\n   - Monitor belt congestion - notice the warning about blocked transport belts\n   - Ensure proper spacing between input/output entities\n\nNAMESPACE\nImportant Variables:\n- `pickup_position`: Position - Coordinates where inserters collect items\n- `drop_position`: Position - Coordinates where inserters place items\n- `direction`: Direction - Enum indicating entity orientation\n- `status`: EntityStatus - Current operational status of entities\n- `inventory`: Inventory - Container for storing items\n\nEntity States:\n- EntityStatus.NO_INGREDIENTS: Furnaces waiting for input materials\n- EntityStatus.WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS: Inserters waiting for items to move\n- EntityStatus.WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION: Inserters unable to place items due to full destination\n- EntityStatus.NORMAL: Entity operating normally\n- EntityStatus.NO_FUEL: Entity requires fuel to operate"}
