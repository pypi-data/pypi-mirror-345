For example, `place_entity` requires a `Direction` object as its second argument.\n\n#### Errors when using undefined variables\n- Ensure all variables are defined before using them. Check for typos and undefined names.\n\n#### Errors when placing entities next to another entity\n- Ensure there are no collisions with existing entities or the area is not water before placing.\n- Consider increasing the spacing, changing the direction, or changing the reference position.\n\n#### Errors when inserting items into a furnace or assembling machine\n- Ensure there are items to insert into the furnace or assembling machine before attempting to insert.\n\n#### Errors when connecting entities with pipes\n- Ensure the pipe connection points are not blocked and the target entity is able to receive the fluid from the source entity.\n\n#### Errors when checking the status of entities\n- Ensure the entity exists and is properly initialized before checking its status.\n\n#### Errors due to undefined names\n- Ensure that all names used in the code are defined. For example, 'copper_inserter' is not defined.\n\n#### Errors when attempting to insert items without having them in inventory\n- Ensure that the required items are available in the inventory before attempting to insert them into an entity.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n#### Important Variables\n- `copper_drill`: Burner mining drill entity at position(-46.0, 71.0)\n- `iron_drill`: Burner mining drill entity at position(16.0, 71.0)\n- `copper_furnace`: Stone furnace entity at position(-45.0, 73.0)\n- `iron_furnace`: Stone furnace entity at position(17.0, 73.0)\n- `copper_inserter`: Burner inserter entity at position(-44.5, 71.5)\n- `iron_inserter`: Burner inserter entity at position(17.5, 71.5)\n- `copper_output_chest`: Wooden chest entity at position(-44.5, 70.5)\n- `iron_output_chest`: Wooden chest entity at position(17.5, 70.5)\n- `offshore_pump`: Offshore pump entity at position(-9.5, -0.5)\n- `boiler`: Boiler entity at position(-6.5, 1.0)\n- `steam_engine`: Steam engine entity at position(-2.5, 3.5)\n- `assembling_machine_copper_cable`: Assembling machine 2 entity at position(1.5, 4.5)\n\nNo utility functions have been defined by the agent in"}
