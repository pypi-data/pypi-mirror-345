{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Coal Mining Structure at position(x=41, y=-82)\nConsists of a burner-mining-drill at position(x=41, y=-82) and two chests at positions(x=40.5, y=-83.5) and (x=41.5, y=-83.5) for storing coal.\n\n### Coal Transport Structure\nConsists of a burner-inserter at position(x=39.5, y=-81.5) that transports coal from the mining drill to other parts of the factory.\n\n### Furnace Structure at position(x=0, y=0)\nConsists of a stone-furnace at position(x=0, y=0) for smelting coal into other products.\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n* Errors when extracting coal from the coal chest: \n  - Make sure the coal chest is not full before attempting to extract coal.\n  - Ensure the agent is at the correct position to extract coal from the coal chest.\n* Errors when inserting coal into the burner-mining-drill: \n  - Make sure the drill's fuel source is not full before attempting to insert coal.\n  - Ensure the agent is at the correct position to insert coal into the drill.\n* Errors when mining coal: \n  - Make sure the chest at the drop position is not full before continuing to mine coal.\n  - Ensure the fuel source for the mining drill is not full.\n\n# NAMESPACE\n* Important variables:\n  - `coal_chest`: The chest used to store coal.\n  - `drill`: The burner-mining-drill used to mine coal.\n  - `inserter`: The burner-inserter used to transport coal.\n  - `furnace`: The stone-furnace used to smelt coal.\n* Utility functions:\n  - `extract_item(Prototype.Coal, coal_chest, quantity=100)`: Extracts coal from the coal chest.\n  - `insert_item(Prototype.Coal, drill, quantity=1)`: Inserts coal into the mining drill.\n  - Failure modes: \n    - Extracting coal from a full coal chest.\n    - Inserting coal into a full mining drill.\n  - Success modes: \n    - Successfully extracting coal from the coal chest.\n    - Successfully inserting coal into the mining drill."}
