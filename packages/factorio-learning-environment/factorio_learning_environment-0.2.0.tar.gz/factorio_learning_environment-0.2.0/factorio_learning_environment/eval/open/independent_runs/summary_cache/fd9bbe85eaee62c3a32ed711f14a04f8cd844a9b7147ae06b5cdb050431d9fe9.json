{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-9.5, 24.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Boiler at position (-10.5, 21.0)\n- Pipe group connecting offshore pump and boiler, with pipes at positions: (-12.5, 21.5), (-11.5, 21.5), (-11.5, 22.5), (-10.5, 22.5), (-10.5, 23.5), (-9.5, 23.5)\n- Electricity group with poles at various positions, including: (-7.5, 18.5), (-7.5, 17.5), (-8.5, 16.5), ..., (-3.5, 22.5), (-0.5, 22.5), (-1.5, 22.5)\n\n### Stone Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with a full fuel inventory of coal and a status indicating no ingredients to smelt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Placing Offshore Pump\n- Ensure that the offshore pump is placed near a water source. Multiple attempts to place the offshore pump failed due to unsuitable positions.\n\n### Errors in Placing Boiler and Steam Engine\n- Verify the suitability of the terrain before placing boilers and steam engines. Attempts to place these entities at specific coordinates failed due to unsuitability.\n\n### Connection Errors Between Offshore Pump and Boiler\n- Check the connectivity and alignment of pipes when connecting offshore pumps to boilers. Failed connections were noted due to improper pipe alignment.\n\n### Errors in Connecting Electric Poles\n- Ensure proper spacing and alignment when placing electric poles to avoid connectivity issues. Placement issues were noted, preventing successful connections.\n\n### Errors in Picking Up Entities\n- When picking up entities, ensure that the correct arguments are used, specifically a Position object as the second argument, to avoid errors.\n\n### General Placement and Connection Tips\n- Before placing any entity, confirm that the tile is unoccupied and suitable for the entity type.\n- For successful connections, ensure that all entities are properly aligned and within the required proximity for connection."}
