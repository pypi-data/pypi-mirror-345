{"content": "Great! You've successfully crafted a Boiler. Now, let's proceed with setting up the Boiler in your setup to ensure power generation and connectivity. Here's what you should do next:\n\n1. **Place the Boiler**: Decide on a suitable location near the existing infrastructure (such as the Offshore Pump and Steam Engine) to place the Boiler. This will facilitate easy connections.\n\n2. **Connect the Boiler**:\n   - **Water Connection**: Connect the Boiler to the Offshore Pump to ensure a steady supply of water.\n   - **Steam Connection**: Connect the Boiler to the Steam Engine to generate power.\n\n3. **Refuel the Boiler**: Ensure the Boiler is fueled with coal to start generating steam.\n\n4. **Verify Connections**: Check all connections to ensure they are correctly established and that the system is operational.\n\nHere's a sample script to guide you through these steps:\n\n```python\n# Place the Boiler at a suitable position\nboiler_position = Position(x=1.0, y=1.0)  # Adjust the coordinates as needed\nplace_entity(Prototype.Boiler, boiler_position)\nprint(f\"Placed Boiler at {boiler_position}.\")\n\n# Retrieve the newly placed Boiler entity\nboiler = get_entities({Prototype.Boiler})[0]\n\n# Connect the Boiler to the Offshore Pump and Steam Engine\noffshore_pump = get_entities({Prototype.OffshorePump})[0]\nsteam_engine = get_entities({Prototype.SteamEngine})[0]\n\nassert connect_entities(offshore_pump, boiler), \"Failed to connect Offshore Pump to Boiler.\"\nassert connect_entities(boiler, steam_engine), \"Failed to connect Boiler to Steam Engine.\"\n\n# Refuel the Boiler\ninsert_item(Prototype.Coal, boiler, 10)\nprint(\"Inserted coal into the Boiler.\")\n\n# Verify the setup\nfinal_entities_status = get_entities()\nprint(\"Final Entities Status:\", final_entities_status)\n```\n\n### Tips for Success:\n- **Positioning**: Ensure that the Boiler is placed within reach of both the Offshore Pump and Steam Engine to minimize connection issues.\n- **Resource Management**: Keep an eye on your inventory to ensure you have enough coal and other resources for continuous operation.\n- **Debugging**: Use print statements to verify the status of each entity and connection to quickly identify and resolve any issues.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to set up a functioning power generation system in Factorio.", "summary_range": "[1-272]"}
