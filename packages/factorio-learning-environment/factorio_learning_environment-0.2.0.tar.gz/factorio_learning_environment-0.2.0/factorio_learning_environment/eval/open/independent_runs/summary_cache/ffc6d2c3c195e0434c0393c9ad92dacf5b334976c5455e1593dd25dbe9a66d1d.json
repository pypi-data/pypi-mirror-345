{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with a fuel inventory of coal and a current output of iron plates.\n\n### Pipe Network\nConsists of the following entities:\n- PipeGroup at Position (x=-12.5, y=21.5) with pipes connecting positions (x=-12.5, y=21.5), (x=-11.5, y=21.5), (x=-10.5, y=23.5), (x=-10.5, y=22.5), (x=-11.5, y=22.5), and (x=-9.5, y=23.5).\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of the following entities:\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at various positions including (x=-4.5, y=22.5), (x=-3.5, y=22.5), (x=-1.5, y=22.5), and others extending to (x=0.5, y=21.5) and (x=0.5, y=20.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing offshore pumps\n- Ensure there is a suitable water source and clear space for placing offshore pumps. Check the terrain and make sure the pump is aligned correctly with the water source.\n\n### Errors when placing boilers\n- Verify the terrain and ensure the position is suitable for placing boilers. Avoid placing boilers on occupied or unsuitable tiles.\n\n### Errors when connecting pipes\n- Ensure that the pipes are correctly aligned and connected between the offshore pump and the boiler. Check for any obstructions or misalignments in the pipe network.\n\n### Errors when placing steam engines\n- Confirm that the steam engine has a clear and suitable position for placement. Ensure it is aligned with the boiler and connected properly.\n\n### Errors when connecting electric poles\n- Make sure electric poles are placed within the correct range and are not obstructed by other entities. Ensure they are connected to form a continuous electricity network.\n\n### General Placement Errors\n- Always verify the suitability of the position before placing any entity. Check for obstructions and ensure the terrain is appropriate for the entity being placed."}
