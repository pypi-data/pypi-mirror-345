Repeated errors (Steps 210, 211, 213, 214, 215, 216, 217) indicate that transport belts must feed into an inserter that then transfers items to the intended machine.\n\u2022 Before placing an entity, verify that the player is within the allowed distance. An attempt to place a wooden chest at (3.5, 15.5) failed because the target was too far.\n\u2022 Avoid undefined variable errors by ensuring that all target identifiers (e.g. \u201ctarget_chest\u201d) are correctly defined and referenced.\n\u2022 Confirm that the required item exists in the inventory before placement. An error occurred due to the absence of a wooden chest in inventory during a placement attempt."}
