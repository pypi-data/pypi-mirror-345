The error indicates that the furnace at position (6, 0) was full when trying to insert iron-ore.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it. \n\n### Repeated errors with furnace insertions\n- The agent repeatedly encountered issues inserting iron-ore into the furnace at position (6, 0). Check the furnace's inventory status before attempting to insert items."}
