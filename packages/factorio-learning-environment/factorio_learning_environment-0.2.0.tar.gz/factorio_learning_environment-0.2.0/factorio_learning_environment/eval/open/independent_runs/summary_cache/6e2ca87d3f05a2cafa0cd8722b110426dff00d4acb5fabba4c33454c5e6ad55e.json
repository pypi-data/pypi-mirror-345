{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Incomplete Electricity Generation Setup near Position (-9.5, -0.5)\nThis setup is designed to generate electricity but is currently non-functional because the Boiler lacks fuel. The exact components and their positions are not detailed in the logs, but it likely involves an offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Non-functional Power Setup Halting Progress\n*   The agent concluded that the goal was unachievable due to persistent environmental constraints preventing the automation of the power system's fueling. The Boiler requires fuel, but the agent determined it could not automate this process. The power system must be made operational (e.g., by manually fueling the boiler if automation is not feasible) before further progress can be made."}
