{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-0.5, 25.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (-0.5, 25.5) (Status: Not Connected)\n- Boiler at position (-5.5, 25.0) (Status: Not Connected)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5) (Status: Working)\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine, with pipes at positions including (-8.5, 23.5), (-7.5, 23.5), and others in the vicinity.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Furnace at position (15.0, 0.0) with a status of \"No Ingredients\" and containing 50 iron plates.\n- Inserters at positions (16.5, 0.5) and (17.5, 0.5), connected to a power network but not receiving electricity.\n- Wooden chests at positions (5.5, 0.5) and (18.5, 0.5), with one containing 20 iron ore.\n\n### Power Network\n- Connected inserters at positions (16.5, 0.5) and (17.5, 0.5) to power network with poles.\n- Electricity poles at various positions including (11.5, 6.5), (7.5, 10.5), (15.5, 2.5), and others, but the network is not supplying power.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Pipe Placement\n- Ensure that the target location for placing pipes is unoccupied before attempting placement. Clear existing entities if necessary.\n- Adjust the strategy for placing underground pipes, ensuring that both start and end positions are clear and properly aligned.\n\n### Errors with Boiler and Steam Engine Connectivity\n- Verify that all components of the electricity generator (boiler, steam engine, and pipes) are properly connected to ensure functionality.\n- Ensure that the boiler has a connected water supply from the offshore pump and that the steam engine is connected to the boiler.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Power Supply\n- Ensure that inserters are connected to a functioning power network. Check that electricity poles are properly placed and connected to the power source.\n- Verify that the power network is active and supplying electricity to all connected entities."}
