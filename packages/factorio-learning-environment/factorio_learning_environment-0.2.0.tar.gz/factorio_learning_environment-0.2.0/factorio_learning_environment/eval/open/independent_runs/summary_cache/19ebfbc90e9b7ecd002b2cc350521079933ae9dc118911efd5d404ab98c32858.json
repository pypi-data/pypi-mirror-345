{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll generate a comprehensive report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing System (around x=41-45, y=-80 to -83)\nComplex system consisting of:\n- Burner mining drill (x=41.0, y=-82.0) mining coal\n- Iron chest (x=41.5, y=-83.5) storing excess coal (1600 coal)\n- Wooden chest (x=41.5, y=-80.5) as intermediate storage (741 coal)\n- Two burner inserters forming a transfer chain:\n  - First inserter (x=42.5, y=-80.5) moving coal from wooden chest\n  - Second inserter (x=43.5, y=-81.5) transferring coal to furnace\n\n### Smelting Area (around x=45-49, y=-81)\nTwo stone furnaces set up:\n- First furnace (x=45.0, y=-81.0)\n- Second furnace (x=47.0, y=-81.0)\nBoth furnaces have coal fuel but no ingredients to process\n\n### Storage System\n- Wooden chest (x=49.5, y=-80.5) containing 1500 iron plates\n\n### Transport System\n- Belt group running from y=-68.5 to y=-77.5 at x=42.5\n\nERROR TIPS\n1. Inserter Placement Issues\n   - Before placing inserters, verify the target location is clear of other entities\n   - Ensure proper spacing between inserters in a chain to allow for item transfer\n   - Check that inserter drop positions align with pickup positions of next entity in chain\n\n2. Entity Configuration Issues\n   - Multiple instances of \"output blocked by item on ground\" warnings suggest need to better align inserter drop positions with target entities\n   - Ensure inserters are properly rotated to face their target entities\n   - Verify that inserter chain pickup/drop positions form a continuous path\n\n3. Resource Management\n   - Several \"chest is full\" warnings indicate need for better storage management\n   - Multiple \"furnace fuel source is full\" warnings suggest need to balance fuel distribution\n\nNAMESPACE\nImportant Variables:\n- `first_inserter`: BurnerInserter\n- `second_inserter`: BurnerInserter\n- `furnace`: Furnace\n- `drill`: BurnerMiningDrill\n- `chest`: Chest (multiple instances)\n\nEntity States:\n- EntityStatus.WORKING: Operating normally\n- EntityStatus.WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION: Output blocked\n- EntityStatus.NO_INGREDIENTS: Missing input materials\n- EntityStatus.NORMAL: Default state for storage entities"}
