{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Coal mining operation at position (41, -82)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (position (41, -82)) with fuel source\n- Wooden chest (position (40.5, -83.5)) for storing coal\n- Wooden chest (position (41.5, -83.5)) for storing coal\n- Burner inserter (position (39.5, -81.5)) for transporting coal\n\n### Furnace at position (0, 0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace (position (0, 0)) for smelting\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n* Errors when extracting coal from coal chest:\n  - Ensure the coal chest is not full before attempting to extract coal\n  - Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items\n* Errors when inserting coal into bur-mrneining-drill:\n  - Ensure the burner-mining-driventoll'ry is ns inot full before attempting to insert coal\n  - Empty the chest at the drop position to continue mining\n* Errors when using incorrect API:\n  - Define the correct position before using it (e.g., `Position(x=41.5, y=-83.5)` instead of `osiPtion(x=41.5, y=-83.5)`)\n\n### NAMESPACE\n* Important variables:\n  - `coal_chest`: a wooden chest for storing coal\n  - `drill`: a burner mining drill for mining coal\n  - `inserter`: a burner inserter for transporting coal\n  - `furnace`: a stone furnace for smelting\n* Utility functions:\n  - `extract_item`: extracts items from a chest\n  - `insert_item`: inserts items into a machine\n  - `get_entity`: gets an entity at a specific position\n  - Failure modes:\n    - `extract_item` fails when the chest is full or the item is not available\n    - `insert_item` fails when the machine's inventory is full or the item is not available\n    - `get_entity` fails when the entity is not found at the specified position\n  - Success modes:\n    - `extract_item` succeeds when the item is extracted from the chest\n    - `insert_item` succeeds when the item is inserted into the machine\n    - `get_entity` succeeds when the entity is found at the specified position"}
