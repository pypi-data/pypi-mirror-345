{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production at (-15, -50)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-15, -50) mining iron ore\n- Stone furnace at (-14, -48) smelting iron plates\nCurrently working but output is blocked\n\n### Iron Plate Production at (0, 0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace at (0, 0)\n- Stone furnace at (2, 0)\nBoth furnaces currently idle with no ingredients\n\n### Copper Plate Production at (4, 4)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace at (4, 4) with 30 copper plates in output\n- Stone furnace at (6, 4) with 6 copper plates in output\nBoth furnaces currently idle with no ingredients\n\n### Power Generation System\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, 24.5) extracting water\n- Boiler at (-2, 23.5)\n- Steam engine at (9.5, 19.5)\n- Connected by two pipe groups:\n  - Water pipes from pump to boiler\n  - Steam pipes from boiler to engine\n- Electric poles at (5.5, 13.5), (9.5, 17.5), and (2.5, 10.5)\nSystem is partially working but boiler needs fuel\n\n### Research Lab at (0.5, 8.5)\n- Lab with 7 automation science packs\n- Connected to power network but currently not powered\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inventory Management Errors\n- Check inventory before attempting to insert items into machines\n- Ensure you have required raw materials before crafting complex items\n- Keep track of fuel levels in machines to prevent them from stopping\n\n### Recipe and Crafting Errors\n- Some items like copper plates and iron plates require furnaces to craft\n- Raw resources like wood must be gathered, they cannot be crafted\n- Check all prerequisites and sub-ingredients before attempting to craft complex items\n\n### Building Placement Errors\n- Ensure you have the required item in inventory before attempting to place buildings\n- Check building requirements and prerequisites before placement attempts\n\n### Type Operation Errors\n- Cannot perform arithmetic operations directly on prototype attributes\n- Use proper attribute access methods for prototype properties\n\n### Machine Operation Errors\n- Ensure machines have all required inputs (fuel, ingredients) before operation\n- Check for blocked outputs that prevent machines from working\n- Verify power connections for electrical machines\n\n### Connection Errors\n- Have required connection items (like pipes) in inventory before attempting to connect entities\n- Ensure proper positioning and compatibility when connecting different entities"}
