For example, the inserter could not be placed at (3.0, 0.0) because something was in the way.\n\n### Errors Due to Insufficient Inventory\n- Always check your inventory for required items before attempting to insert them into machines. For instance, the attempt to insert coal into a furnace failed because there was no coal in the inventory.\n\n### Errors Related to Power Supply\n- Ensure that all entities requiring electricity are connected to a power source. Many entities, such as inserters and assembling machines, are not receiving electricity, causing them to be non-functional.\n\n### Errors Related to Fuel Supply\n- Ensure that all fuel-dependent entities, such as boilers and burner mining drills, have sufficient fuel to operate. Several entities are currently out of fuel and not functioning."}
