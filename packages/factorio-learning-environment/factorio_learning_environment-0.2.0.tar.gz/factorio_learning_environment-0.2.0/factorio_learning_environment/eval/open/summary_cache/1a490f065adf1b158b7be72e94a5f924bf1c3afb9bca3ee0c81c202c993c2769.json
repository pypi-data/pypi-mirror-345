{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron gear wheel production line at position around (16.0, 71.0) to (21.5, 73.5)  \nConsists of the following connected entities forming a production chain for iron gear wheels:  \n- Burner mining drill at position (16.0, 71.0) extracting iron ore, fueled with coal (31 units), currently blocked due to no sink entity accepting output  \n- Stone furnace at position (17.0, 73.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates, fueled with coal (42 units), source and output inventories full, causing blockage  \n- Burner inserters at positions (17.5, 71.5), (19.5, 73.5), and (23.5, 73.5) transferring materials between drill, furnace, assembling machine, and chest; all fueled with coal except occasional fuel shortages at (23.5, 73.5)  \n- Wooden chest at position (18.5, 73.5) collecting iron gear wheels, currently empty  \n- Assembling machine 2 at position (21.5, 73.5) set to craft iron gear wheels, still not receiving electricity and thus not operational  \n- Small electric poles at positions (21.5, 75.5), (18.5, 72.5), and (18.5, 75.5) providing electrical connections but no power source connected, assembler remains unpowered  \n\nNo new structures were successfully placed due to missing power generation entities (offshore pump, boiler, steam engine). Attempts to place offshore pump failed due to lack of inventory. Power poles connected to assembler but no energized power network exists.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to assembler not receiving power  \n- Assembling machine remains unpowered despite electric poles being placed and connected.  \n- No power generation entities (steam engine, boiler, offshore pump) are present on the map, preventing power network energization.  \n- Attempts to place offshore pump fail due to absence in inventory.  \n- To fix, craft or acquire offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine to establish a power source.  \n- Ensure power poles form a continuous network connected to these power generators and the assembler.  \n\n### Errors due to burner inserters and other entities running out of fuel or fuel insertion failures  \n- Burner inserters and furnace sometimes run out of coal fuel, halting operations.  \n- Attempts to insert coal fail when inventory is empty or insufficient.  \n- Maintain a sufficient coal stockpile in inventory to reliably fuel burner inserters, furnaces, and drills.  \n- Consider automating coal supply or switching to electric inserters once power is available.  \n\n### Errors inserting offshore pump and other power generation entities  \n- Multiple failed attempts to place offshore pump due to no offshore pump in inventory.  \n- Ensure required power generation entities are crafted or acquired before attempting placement.  \n- Plan resource gathering and crafting steps to prioritize power infrastructure.  \n\n### Errors related to blocked outputs and full inventories  \n- Burner mining drill output blocked due to no downstream sink accepting output items.  \n- Stone furnace source and output inventories full, indicating downstream bottlenecks.  \n- Burner inserters waiting due to blocked furnace belt or full inventories.  \n- Increase storage capacity or clear inventories to prevent blocking.  \n- Ensure inserters and chests downstream have capacity to accept items.  \n\n### General placement and connection error tips (from previous report)  \n- Confirm target tiles are free before placing entities to avoid collisions.  \n- Use inserters between furnaces and belts rather than connecting belts directly to furnaces.  \n- Verify assembling machine recipes and power connections before starting production.  \n\nNAMESPACE\n\nNo user-defined functions have been defined in the current steps."}
