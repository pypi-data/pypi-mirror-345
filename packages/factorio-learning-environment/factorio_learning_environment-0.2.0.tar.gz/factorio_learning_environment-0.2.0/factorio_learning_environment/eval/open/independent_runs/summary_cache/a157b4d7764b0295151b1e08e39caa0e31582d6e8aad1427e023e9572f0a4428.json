{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n###Coal Mining and Storage System at position(41.0, -82.0)\n- Burner mining drill mining coal at (41.0, -82.0)\n- Connected to input chest at (41.5, -83.5) containing 1600 coal\n- Connected to output chest at (41.5, -80.5) containing 800 coal\n- Additional storage chest at (41.5, -84.5) containing 1600 coal\n\n###Iron Smelting System\nComponents:\n- Input chest for iron ore at (45.5, -84.5)\n- Two stone furnaces:\n  - First furnace at (45.0, -81.0) with 50 coal as fuel\n  - Second furnace at (47.0, -81.0) with 49 coal as fuel\n- Two burner inserters for furnace feeding:\n  - First inserter at (44.5, -79.5) picking from (43.5, -79.5) and dropping to (45.5, -79.5)\n  - Second inserter at (46.5, -79.5) picking from (45.5, -79.5) and dropping to (47.5, -79.5)\n- Intermediate chest at (45.5, -79.5)\n- Output chest at (49.5, -80.5) containing 1500 iron plates\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing inserters in occupied spaces\n- Before placing inserters, verify the target location is clear of other entities\n- Multiple attempts were made to place inserters at already occupied positions (45.5, -80.0), (45.0, -80.5), (44.5, -80.5), (45.0, -79.5)\n- Consider implementing a position validation check before placement attempts\n\n### System efficiency issues\n- Coal mining system is backing up due to full chests\n- Iron smelting system has no ingredients despite having infrastructure in place\n- Ensure proper item flow between components by managing chest capacities and transfer rates\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nFunctions:\n- place_entity(): Places entities in the world\n  - Success: Returns placed entity when position is clear\n  - Failure: Throws exception when target position is occupied\n\nImportant Variables:\n- first_inserter: BurnerInserter\n- second_inserter: BurnerInserter"}
