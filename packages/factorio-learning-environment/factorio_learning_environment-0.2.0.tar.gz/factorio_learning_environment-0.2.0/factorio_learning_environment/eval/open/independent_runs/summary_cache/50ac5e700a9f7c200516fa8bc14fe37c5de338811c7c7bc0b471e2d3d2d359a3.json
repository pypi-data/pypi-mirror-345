{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Transport System at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0)\n- Transport Belt Group connecting from the mining drill to a wooden chest at position (-8.5, -49.5). The belt group includes multiple belts with various directions to transport the mined iron ore.\n\n### Iron Smelting Facility at Position (-10.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-10.0, -50.0)\n- Burner Inserter at position (-10.5, -48.5) that moves items from the transport belt into the furnace.\n- Transport Belt Group connecting the furnace to the inserter.\n\n### Storage and Distribution System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (-8.5, -49.5) for storing iron ore.\n- Burner Inserters at positions (-7.5, -49.5) and (-5.5, -49.5) for moving items between belts and the chest.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Belts Directly to a Wooden Chest\n- Ensure to use an inserter when attempting to connect transport belts to a wooden chest. Belts cannot be directly connected to chests.\n\n### Errors when Inserting Items without Inventory\n- Before attempting to insert items into an entity, verify that the required items are available in your inventory.\n\n### Errors in Belt Path Connection\n- Verify that the path for connecting belts is valid and normalized. Ensure that the start and end positions are correctly aligned for belt connections.\n\n### General Tips\n- Regularly check the fuel levels of all entities that require fuel to maintain continuous operation.\n- Investigate and resolve any warnings or status issues with entities, such as \"out of fuel\" or \"no ingredients to smelt,\" to ensure efficient production."}
