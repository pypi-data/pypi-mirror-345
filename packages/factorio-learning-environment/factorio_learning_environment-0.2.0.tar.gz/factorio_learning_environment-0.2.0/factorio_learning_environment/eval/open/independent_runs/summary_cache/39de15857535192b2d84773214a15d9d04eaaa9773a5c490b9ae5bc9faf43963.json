{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\u2022 No new composite structures have been successfully placed on the map. Multiple recovery attempts to create a Lab at Position(0.5, 2.5) did not result in a placed entity, so no operational Lab structure exists.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 get_entities Usage Errors\n\u2003\u2013 Avoid using unsupported keyword arguments (e.g. \u201cradius\u201d) when calling get_entities.\n\u2003\u2013 Do not supply positional arguments if the function is defined to take none; confirm the function\u2019s signature and pass parameters accordingly.\n\u2003\u2013 Always check that the return value is a valid iterable before filtering or iterating.\n\n\u2022 Lab Placement and Crafting Issues\n\u2003\u2013 Verify that a Lab item is available in the inventory before attempting to place one at a target position.\n\u2003\u2013 Before crafting a Lab, ensure that sufficient resources and all required sub-ingredients (such as iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, and copper-cables) are available; note that some ingredients require dedicated crafting machines or furnace operations.\n\u2003\u2013 Guard against NoneType errors by validating that searches (e.g. for existing Labs) return a proper list before processing.\n\n\u2022 Resource Conversion and Fallback Strategies\n\u2003\u2013 When a required structure (Lab) is unavailable, implement fallback approaches only after confirming resource availability; incomplete smelting or production processes can lead to missing intermediate ingredients and further crafting failures."}
