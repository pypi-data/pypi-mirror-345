Check the inventory status of chests and furnaces before attempting to extract or transfer items.\n\n### Errors Due to Undefined Variables\n- Make sure all variables are properly defined before use. For example, ensure `new_coal_storage` is defined and initialized before attempting to use it in operations. Double-check for typos or similar variable names that might cause confusion.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Check that the source entities for inserters have the necessary items available. Ensure that the production chain is not blocked and that resources are being fed into the system correctly.\n\n### Errors When Using Extracting but Being Too Far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items."}
