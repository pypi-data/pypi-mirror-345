{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Processing Unit at Position (x=6.0, y=-62.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=6.0, y=-62.0) fueled by coal, currently processing iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at Position (x=7.5, y=-61.5) for storage.\n- Inserter at Position (x=6.5, y=-60.5) transferring items between the furnace and the wooden chest.\n- Small Electric Poles providing power to the inserter and connected entities.\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=-5.5, y=24.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Boiler at Position (x=-5.5, y=24.0) fueled by coal, heating water.\n- Steam Engine at Position (x=-1.5, y=24.5) generating electricity.\n- Offshore Pump at Position (x=-9.5, y=24.5) supplying water.\n- Pipe Group connecting the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine to transport water and steam.\n\n### Laboratory Setup\n- Lab actively researching with automation science packs.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities without required inventory items\n- Ensure that you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to place an entity. For example, attempting to place a stone furnace without having one in the inventory will result in an error.\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Verify that the target tile is unoccupied before placing an entity to avoid placement errors."}
