{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo structures have been successfully constructed on the map. Multiple attempts were made to place and craft a Lab at (0.5, 2.5), but none succeeded due to inventory and resource issues. Although existing furnaces at (5.0, 5.0) and (\u201327.0, \u201360.0) were used for smelting operations, these were pre\u2010existing and not built by the agent.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 Errors in calling get_entities:\n\u2003\u2013 When using get_entities, ensure the call matches its defined signature. Do not include unsupported keyword arguments (such as \u201cradius\u201d) and avoid passing unintended positional arguments.\n\u2003\n\u2022 Lab placement and iteration issues:\n\u2003\u2013 Verify that the inventory contains a Lab before attempting placement at a target position.\n\u2003\u2013 Check that the return value from get_entities is a valid iterable (or reliably fallback to an empty list) before filtering for Lab entities.\n\u2003\n\u2022 Crafting chain and ingredient shortages:\n\u2003\u2013 Confirm that all necessary sub\u2010ingredients (e.g. iron\u2010gear\u2013wheel, electronic\u2013circuit, copper\u2013cable) are available. Prior to initiating Lab crafting, ensure additional resource production (via smelting or other methods) has provided sufficient precursor materials.\n\u2003\u2013 Continuously monitor and validate inventory counts against recipe requirements to avoid missing ingredients during Lab crafting attempts."}
