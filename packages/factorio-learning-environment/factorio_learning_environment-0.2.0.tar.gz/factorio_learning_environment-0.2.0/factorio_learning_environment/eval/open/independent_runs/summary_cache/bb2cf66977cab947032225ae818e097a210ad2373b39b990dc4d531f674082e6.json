{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report (Steps 8-15)\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at position (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump (position -9.5, -0.5)\n- Boiler (position -5.0, 2.5) with coal fuel\n- Steam engine (position 0.5, 6.5)\n- Connected with pipes forming two pipe groups (water and steam systems)\n- Small electric pole (position 3.5, 6.5) connecting to power network\n\n### Iron Mining and Smelting Operation at position (15.5, 70.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill (position 15.5, 70.5) extracting iron ore\n- Wooden chest (position 17.5, 70.5) collecting iron ore (currently contains 14 ore)\n- Stone furnace (position 16.0, 75.0) with coal fuel\n- Burner inserter (position 17.5, 75.5) transferring plates to output chest\n- Wooden chest (position 18.5, 75.5) for plate output (currently contains 20 plates)\n\n### New Iron Production Line at position (38.5, 70.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill (position 38.5, 70.5) facing down\n- Wooden chest (position 38.5, 72.5) collecting iron ore (currently contains 14 ore)\n- Stone furnace (position 41.0, 74.0) with coal fuel\n- Burner inserter (position 39.5, 73.5) transferring ore to furnace\n- Wooden chest (position 42.5, 73.5) for plate output (currently empty)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Persistent inserter placement issues\n- Repeated failures placing output inserters at furnace positions (16.5,75.0), (21.5,70.5), (33.5,73.5), (41.5,73.5)\n- Solution: Ensure 1-tile clearance around furnaces for inserter placement and proper orientation\n\n### Distance-related placement errors\n- Attempted to place small electric pole at (18.5,69.5) while too far away (71.92 distance vs max 10)\n- Solution: Move closer to target position before placing entities\n\n### Furnace operation issues\n- Multiple furnaces showing \"no ingredients to smelt\" despite having fuel\n- Solution: Verify inserter positions and orientations are correctly transferring materials\n- Ensure input chests contain ore and inserters have fuel\n\n### Mining drill warnings\n- Both mining drills have full output chest warnings (positions 17.5,70.5 and 38.5,72.5)\n- Solution: Empty output chests regularly or expand storage capacity\n\n### Assertion error on furnace status\n- Assertion failed checking furnace1.status == WORKING\n- Solution: Verify all furnace requirements are met (fuel, input materials, output space) before status checks\n\n### General placement recommendations\n- Clear target areas completely before attempting placements\n- Double-check entity orientations before placement\n- Verify power connections for electric entities"}
