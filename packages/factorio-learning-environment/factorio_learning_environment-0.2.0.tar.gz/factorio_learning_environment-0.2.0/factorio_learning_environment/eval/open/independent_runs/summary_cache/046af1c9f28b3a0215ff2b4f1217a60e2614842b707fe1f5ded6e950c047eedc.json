{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0)\n  - Fuel: 1 unit of coal\n  - Status: Working\n  - Warnings: Output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Drop Position: (x=-16.5, y=-52.5)\n  - Resources: 40,000 units of iron ore\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)\n  - Fuel: 14 units of coal\n  - Status: No Ingredients\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Furnace Result: 60 units of iron plate\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- **Cannot place Wooden Chest**: Ensure the target position for placing a wooden chest is unoccupied and suitable for placement.\n- **Cannot place Transport Belt**: Verify that the desired location for placing a transport belt is clear and accessible.\n- **Cannot place Burner Inserter**: Check that the intended location for placing a burner inserter is available and not obstructed by other entities.\n\n### Errors when moving entities\n- **Cannot move the Stone Furnace**: Before attempting to move a stone furnace, ensure that the target location is valid and that there is an entity of the correct type at the specified position.\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities\n- **Could not get Prototype.StoneFurnace**: Confirm that there is an existing stone furnace at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it. Double-check the coordinates for accuracy.\n\n### General Tips\n- **Clearing Items from Drill's Drop Position**: Regularly clear items from the drill's drop position to prevent blockage and ensure continuous operation.\n- **Inventory Management**: Keep track of inventory levels to ensure sufficient resources are available for production and construction tasks."}
