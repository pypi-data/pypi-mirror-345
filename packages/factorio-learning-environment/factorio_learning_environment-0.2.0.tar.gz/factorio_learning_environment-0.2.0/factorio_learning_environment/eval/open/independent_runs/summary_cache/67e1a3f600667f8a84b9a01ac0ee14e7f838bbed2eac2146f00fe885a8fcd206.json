{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nNo structures have been successfully created on the map as of the latest execution steps. All attempts to place entities such as Stone Furnaces, Wooden Chests, and Transport Belts have failed due to various errors, resulting in no entities being present on the map.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities on non-buildable tiles\n- Ensure that the target position for placing entities like Stone Furnaces, Wooden Chests, and Transport Belts is buildable. Check the buildable status of a tile before attempting to place an entity.\n\n### Errors due to lack of resources\n- Verify that there are sufficient resources available for the intended operations. For example, ensure that there is enough coal available to supply to a Stone Furnace before attempting to use it.\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied or restricted areas\n- Confirm that the target position for placing an entity is not occupied by another entity or restricted by global build restrictions. Check for any environmental constraints or existing entities that might block the placement.\n\n### General placement errors\n- Before placing any entity, ensure that the environment is correctly initialized and that there are no global build restrictions that might prevent placement."}
