{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nCurrently, there are no structures on the map. The agent attempted to place several entities, but all attempts were unsuccessful due to placement errors. As a result, there are no existing structures to report.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity or invalid\n- Ensure you can place an entity on a tile before attempting placement. Check for any obstructions or invalid placement areas.\n- The agent attempted to place a Wooden Chest at multiple locations (e.g., x=30.0 y=30.0, x=40.5 y=-82.5, x=50.0 y=-90.0, x=0.0 y=0.0, x=100.0 y=-150.0), but all attempts failed. Verify that the target location is clear and valid for placement.\n- The agent also attempted to place a Transport Belt at x=45.0 y=-85.0 and x=65.0 y=-105.0, but these placements were unsuccessful. Ensure the path is clear and the terrain is suitable for belt placement.\n- An attempt to place a Stone Furnace at x=5.0 y=5.0 was also unsuccessful. Confirm that the location is suitable for furnace placement.\n\n### General Tips\n- Regularly check the environment and map for any changes that might affect entity placement.\n- Consider using visual indicators or map overlays to identify valid placement areas for different entities."}
