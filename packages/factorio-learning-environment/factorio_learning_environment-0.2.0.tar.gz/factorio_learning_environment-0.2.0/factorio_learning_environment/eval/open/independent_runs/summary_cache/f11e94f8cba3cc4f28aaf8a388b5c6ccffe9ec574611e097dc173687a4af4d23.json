{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) for iron ore extraction.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=41.0, y=-80.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0) connected to a Stone Furnace at position (x=-20.0, y=-71.0) for copper ore extraction and smelting into copper plates.\n\n### Storage Facility\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=43.5, y=-79.5) for storing miscellaneous items.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Insufficient Inventory for Insertion\n- Ensure that you have enough coal in your inventory before attempting to insert it into furnaces or mining drills. This will prevent errors related to insufficient inventory.\n\n### Errors due to Entities Running Out of Fuel\n- Regularly check the fuel levels of your mining drills and furnaces. Refill them with coal or other suitable fuel to maintain continuous operation and avoid warnings such as 'out of fuel'.\n\n### Errors due to No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to process. This will prevent warnings such as 'no ingredients to smelt'.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `insert_item(item: Prototype, target: Entity, quantity: int)`: This function attempts to insert a specified quantity of an item into a target entity. Ensure that the inventory has sufficient items before calling this function to avoid insertion errors.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `copper_furnace`: Represents the copper furnace entity, used in insertion operations.\n- `iron_furnace`: Represents the iron furnace entity, used in insertion operations.\n- `iron_mining_drill`: Represents the iron mining drill entity, used in insertion operations.\n- `copper_mining_drill`: Represents the copper mining drill entity, used in insertion operations."}
