{"content": "\"\"\"\nThe furnace has processed some of the **Copper Ore**, but it appears that no **Copper Plates** have been produced yet. Here\u2019s the updated status:\n\n### Current Inventory Overview:\n- 3 pieces of stone furnaces\n- 2 pieces of coal remaining for fuel\n- **5 pieces of iron ore**\n- **8 pieces of copper ore** remaining (down from 10)\n- **3 pieces of iron plates available**.\n\n### Furnace Status:\n- The furnace is now at **\"FULL_OUTPUT\"** status, indicating it has completed its current cycle but has not produced any Copper Plates.\n- The furnace still has **8 Copper Ore** left, meaning it has not yet converted any of it into plates.\n\n### Observations:\n- It seems there may be an issue with the furnace not producing Copper Plates. This could be due to the lack of a specific crafting recipe or perhaps the need for a different type of furnace.\n- The current setup seems insufficient for producing the necessary components to progress.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Check for Copper Plate Production**: I will need to ensure that the furnace is set up correctly to produce Copper Plates. This may involve checking if I need to transfer the Copper Ore to a different type of furnace or if there\u2019s a specific recipe I need to enable.\n2. **Consider Alternative Actions**: If the furnace is not producing Copper Plates, I may need to consider crafting additional furnaces or finding another way to smelt the Copper Ore.\n\nLet\u2019s check if there are any specific settings or configurations needed for the furnace to produce Copper Plates. \n\"\"\"\n\n# Check if the furnace has the correct recipe for Copper Plates\ncopper_plate_recipe = get_prototype_recipe(Prototype.CopperPlate)\n\n# Print the status of the Copper Plate recipe\nprint(f\"Copper Plate Recipe: {copper_plate_recipe}\")  # Status of the Copper Plate recipe.", "summary_range": "[1-244]"}
