{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-11.5, 18.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position -11.5, 18.5), offshore pump (position -9.5, 24.5), and boiler (position -21.5, 28.0). The steam engine is designed to convert steam into electricity, while the offshore pump supplies water to the boiler for steam generation.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 0.0, 0.0) and a furnace (position 0.0, 0.0)\n- Burner mining drill (position 5.0, 5.0) and a furnace (position 5.0, 5.0)\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine at position(z1) and inserter at position(a) that puts into assembling machine\n- Beltgroup (position) that connects the furnace at position y1 to assembling machine at position(z1)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing pipe\n- Ensure that the target position is clear before attempting to place a pipe. If an entity already exists at the target position, remove it before continuing.\n\n### Errors with boiler connections\n- The boiler is currently not connected. Ensure that all necessary connections are made and that the boiler has access to water and fuel to function properly.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it."}
