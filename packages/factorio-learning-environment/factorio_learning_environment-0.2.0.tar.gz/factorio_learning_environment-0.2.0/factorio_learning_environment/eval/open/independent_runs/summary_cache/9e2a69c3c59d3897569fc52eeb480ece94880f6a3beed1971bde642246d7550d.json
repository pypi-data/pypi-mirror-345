For instance, \"Failed to insert iron ore into the first furnace: Could not insert: No iron-ore to insert from your inventory.\"\n\n### Errors with furnace ingredient status\n- Check the status of the furnace before inserting items. If the furnace shows \"no ingredients to smelt,\" it indicates that the required input is missing.\n\n### Errors when the furnace result is full\n- If a warning states \"furnace result is full,\" consider extracting items from the furnace before inserting new materials.\n\n### Errors when using undefined entities\n- Ensure that all entities you are referencing are defined and correctly named in your code. For example, \"Failed to insert iron ore into the new stone furnace: name 'new_stone_furnace' is not defined.\""}
