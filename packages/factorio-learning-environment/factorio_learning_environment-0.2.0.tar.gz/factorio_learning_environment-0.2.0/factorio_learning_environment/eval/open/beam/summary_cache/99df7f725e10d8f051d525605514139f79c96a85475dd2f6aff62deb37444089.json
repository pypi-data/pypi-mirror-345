{"content": "It seems there was an error related to importing from the `factorio_entities` module. The error message indicates that the `Prototype` cannot be imported, which suggests that the module might not be available or the import path is incorrect. Let's address this issue and provide a revised approach:\n\n### Steps to Resolve the Import Error\n\n1. **Verify Module Availability**: Ensure that the `factorio_entities` module is available in your environment. If it's a custom module, make sure it's correctly placed in your project structure.\n\n2. **Correct Import Path**: Double-check the import path. If `Prototype`, `Direction`, and `Position` are part of a different module or need to be defined, adjust the import statements accordingly.\n\n3. **Define Necessary Classes/Enums**: If the module is not available, you might need to define `Prototype`, `Direction`, and `Position` yourself, or use the correct library that provides these.\n\n### Revised Code Without Import Errors\n\nAssuming the necessary classes or functions are defined or available, here's a simplified approach to setting up the power system without relying on the unavailable module:\n\n```python\ntry:\n    # Define or mock necessary classes/enums if not available\n    class Prototype:\n        OffshorePump = \"offshore-pump\"\n        Boiler = \"boiler\"\n        SteamEngine = \"steam-engine\"\n        SmallElectricPole = \"small-electric-pole\"\n        Coal = \"coal\"\n\n    class Direction:\n        UP = \"up\"\n        RIGHT = \"right\"\n\n    # Function to craft and place a power system\n    def setup_power_system():\n        # Check and craft missing entities\n        for entity in [Prototype.OffshorePump, Prototype.Boiler, Prototype.SteamEngine, Prototype.SmallElectricPole]:\n            current_count = inspect_inventory().get(entity, 0)\n            if current_count == 0:\n                craft_item(entity, quantity=1)\n\n        # Place the Offshore Pump near water\n        move_to(nearest(Resource.Water))\n        offshore_pump = place_entity(Prototype.OffshorePump, position=nearest(Resource.Water))\n        \n        # Place the Boiler next to the Offshore Pump\n        boiler = place_entity_next_to(Prototype.Boiler, offshore_pump.position, direction=Direction.UP)\n        \n        # Place the Steam Engine connected to the Boiler\n        steam_engine = place_entity_next_to(Prototype.SteamEngine, boiler.position, direction=Direction.RIGHT)\n        \n        # Connect an Electric Pole to the Steam Engine\n        electric_pole = place_entity_next_to(Prototype.SmallElectricPole, steam_engine.position, direction=Direction.RIGHT)\n\n    setup_power_system()\n\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"Error during setup: {e}\")\n```\n\n### Key Points\n\n- **Mocking Classes/Enums**: If the necessary classes or enums are not available, you can define them within your script as shown.\n- **Error Handling**: The code includes a try-except block to catch and print any errors that occur during the setup process.\n- **Functionality**: The script attempts to craft missing items and places entities in a logical order to set up a basic power system.\n\nMake sure to adapt the code to your specific environment and available libraries. If you have access to the correct module, ensure it's correctly installed and imported.", "summary_range": "[1-302]"}
