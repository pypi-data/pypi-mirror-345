{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\n- Consists of two furnaces:\n  - Furnace 1 and Furnace 2, both supplied with coal and iron ore.\n  - Status updates indicate that both furnaces are actively producing iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied or unsuitable tiles\n- Ensure that the target tile is clear and suitable for the entity you wish to place. Verify that no other entities occupy the space and that the terrain is appropriate for the entity type.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into non-existent or incorrect entities\n- Before attempting to insert items, confirm that the target entity is present and capable of accepting the item. This includes ensuring the entity is within reach and correctly configured to receive the item type.\n\n### Errors with transport belt placement\n- Check the starting position and path of the transport belts to ensure they do not overlap with existing entities or extend into non-buildable areas. Adjust the layout to prevent conflicts.\n\n### Errors with identifying buildable areas\n- When identifying areas for new structures, verify that the entire area is clear and suitable for construction. This includes checking for obstructions and ensuring the terrain supports the intended structure.\n\n### Errors due to lack of resources\n- Ensure that there is a sufficient supply of necessary resources, such as coal and iron ore, before attempting to supply furnaces or other entities. Regularly check inventory levels and replenish as needed."}
