{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nThere are currently no structures on the map. All attempts to place entities such as Burner Mining Drills and Stone Furnaces have failed, resulting in no structures being established.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure that the desired location for placing entities like Burner Mining Drills and Stone Furnaces is not occupied and is suitable for placement. Verify that the location is within the buildable area and not obstructed by other entities or terrain.\n\n### Errors due to incorrect use of BuildingBox\n- When attempting to place a Burner Mining Drill, ensure that the BuildingBox size is appropriate for the available space. Consider decreasing the size of the BuildingBox or using multiple smaller BuildingBoxes to find a viable spot.\n\n### Errors with undefined variables\n- Ensure all variables are defined before use. For instance, the error related to 'furnace' not being defined suggests checking variable declarations and ensuring they are correctly initialized.\n\n### Errors with string indices\n- When using indices with strings, ensure that the indices are integers. This error suggests that there might be an attempt to access a string with a non-integer index, which is not allowed.\n\n### Errors when moving to positions\n- Verify that the positions used in move_to functions are correctly formatted and valid. Ensure that the coordinates are integers or floats and not strings or other invalid types."}
