{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Plate Production at Position (-23.0, -68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) connected to a transport belt network.\n- Transport Belt network connecting the mining drill to a Wooden Chest at position (-23.5, -69.5).\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -70.0) processing copper ore into copper plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-17.5, -69.5) storing copper plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-16.5, -69.5) moving copper plates from the chest to another location.\n\n### Iron Plate Production at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -54.5) storing extracted iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5) transferring iron ore from the chest to a transport belt.\n- Transport Belt network moving iron ore to a Wooden Chest at position (-12.5, -54.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Storage at Position (-16.5, -64.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (-16.5, -64.5) storing iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-15.5, -64.5) waiting for source items to transfer.\n\n### Miscellaneous Storage and Transport\n- Multiple Wooden Chests at various positions storing resources like coal, iron plates, and copper plates.\n- Several BeltGroups facilitating the movement of resources between different entities on the map.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Pickup and Drop Positions\n- Ensure that the inserter's pickup position matches the source chest position before placing the inserter. Misalignment can cause the inserter to malfunction.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Check that there are source items available for the inserter to pick up. If the inserter is waiting for source items, verify the supply chain to ensure resources are being delivered to the source chest.\n\n### Errors with No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to process. If a furnace is showing \"no ingredients to smelt,\" check the supply line to ensure raw materials are being delivered to the furnace."}
