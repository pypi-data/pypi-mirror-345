{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n###Chest at position(5.5, 5.5)\nConsists of a wooden-chest at position(5.5, 5.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n- Errors when placing pumpjack near crude oil patch:\n  - Ensure the target location is not occupied by another entity or water before attempting to place a pumpjack.\n  - Verify that the crude oil patch is large enough and the center is correctly identified before attempting to place a pumpjack.\n  - Check if the pumpjack is being placed at a valid position relative to the crude oil patch.\n- Errors when using incorrect argument types in API calls:\n  - Ensure that the correct data type is used for API arguments. For example, the `get_entities` function requires a `Position` object as its second argument, not a string.\n  - Be aware that 'Direction' object does not have a 'to_position' attribute; instead, use the correct method to convert direction to a position.\n  - The `Nearest` function does not accept keyword arguments like 'position'. Use the correct syntax for the `Nearest` function.\n- Errors when placing chest at crude oil position or other locations:\n  - Verify that the target location is not occupied by another entity or resource before attempting to place a chest.\n  - Ensure that the chest is being placed at a valid position.\n- Errors when placing entities near the current position:\n  - Make sure to check the entities within a close proximity to the current position before attempting to place new entities.\n- Errors when crafting items with insufficient resources:\n  - Ensure that the required resources are available before attempting to craft an item. For example, crafting iron-gear-wheel requires iron-plate, which must be smelted in a furnace first.\n  - Ensure that the required crafting machines or furnaces are available for crafting or smelting items.\n- Errors due to undefined variables:\n  - Ensure that all variables are defined before they are used in the code.\n\n### NAMESPACE\nNo functions have been defined by the agent."}
