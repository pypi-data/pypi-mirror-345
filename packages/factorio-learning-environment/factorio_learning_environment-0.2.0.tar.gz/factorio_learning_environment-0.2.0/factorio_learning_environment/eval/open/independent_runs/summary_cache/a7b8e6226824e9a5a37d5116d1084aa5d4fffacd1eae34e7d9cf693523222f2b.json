The 'direction' attribute does not exist for BeltGroup; verify the correct attribute names before accessing them.\n\n### Errors with Connecting Entities\n- When connecting entities, ensure that the start and end positions are valid and that the entities can be connected. Double-check the coordinates and ensure there are no nil values being referenced.\n\n### Handling Full Chests\n- Monitor the inventory of chests to prevent them from becoming full, which can halt production processes. Regularly empty or manage chest inventories to ensure continuous operation.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source items are available for inserters to pick up. If inserters are waiting, check the supply chain leading to the inserter to identify any blockages or shortages."}
