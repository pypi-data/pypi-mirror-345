This suggests that the variable 'x', likely intended to hold the chest's position or some other relevant data, is not being correctly defined or passed within the function responsible for the extraction/insertion process. Ensure that the chest's position is correctly passed to the extraction/insertion function.\n### Errors when crafting\n- The agent is failing to craft automation science packs due to a lack of copper plates. The agent needs to smelt copper ore into copper plates using a furnace before it can craft automation science packs.\n\nNAMESPACE\n- No new functions have been defined.\n- Important variables:\n    - No important variables have been assigned.\n```"}
