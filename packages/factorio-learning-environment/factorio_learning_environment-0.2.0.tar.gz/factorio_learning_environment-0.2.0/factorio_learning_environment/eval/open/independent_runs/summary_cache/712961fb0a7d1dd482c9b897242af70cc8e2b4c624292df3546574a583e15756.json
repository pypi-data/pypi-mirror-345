{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nThis facility is responsible for mining iron ore and processing it into iron plates. It consists of the following entities:\n\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) with a drop position at (x=-14.5, y=-48.5). It is currently working but has a warning that the chest at the drop position is full.\n- **Furnaces** at positions:\n  - (x=-13.0, y=-48.0) with a source inventory of iron ore and producing iron plates.\n  - (x=-11.0, y=-48.0) with a source inventory of iron ore and producing iron plates.\n  - (x=-9.0, y=-48.0) with a source inventory of iron ore and producing iron plates.\n- **Chests** at positions:\n  - (x=-18.5, y=-48.5) containing iron ore.\n  - (x=-16.5, y=-48.5) containing iron ore.\n  - (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) containing iron ore.\n  - (x=-15.5, y=-48.5) empty.\n  - (x=-13.5, y=-49.5) empty.\n  - (x=-12.5, y=-49.5) empty.\n  - (x=-9.5, y=-49.5) empty.\n  - (x=-14.5, y=-47.5) empty.\n\n### Coal Storage and Distribution System\nThis system is used to store and distribute coal for various operations. It consists of the following entities:\n\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0) with a drop position at (x=41.5, y=-80.5). It is currently working but has a warning that the chest at the drop position is full.\n- **Furnace** at position (x=43.0, y=-82.0) with a warning of no ingredients to smelt.\n- **Chests** at positions:\n  - (x=41.5, y=-80.5) containing coal.\n  - (x=42.5, y=-80.5) containing iron plates.\n  - (x=44.5, y=-80.5) containing coal and iron plates.\n  - (x=45.5, y=-80.5) containing coal and iron plates.\n  - (x=47.5, y=-80.5) containing coal and iron plates.\n  - (x=49.5, y=-80.5) containing coal.\n  - (x=41.5, y=-79.5) containing coal.\n- **Burner Inserters** at positions:\n  - (x=43.5, y=-80.5) working, transferring items between chests and furnace.\n  - (x=41.5, y=-78.5) waiting for source items.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Extracting Resources\n- Ensure that the storage chests are not full before attempting to extract resources. Consider periodically clearing the chests to prevent overflow.\n\n### Errors when Clearing Drop Chests\n- Make sure the drop chests are not full before attempting to clear them. Regularly transfer items from drop chests to avoid blocking mining operations.\n\n### Errors when Supplying Ingredients to Furnaces\n- Verify that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to process. Ensure a consistent supply of raw materials to maintain production efficiency."}
