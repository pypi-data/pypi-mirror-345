{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System (Original)\n- **Offshore pump** at position (-9.5, -0.5) - Not connected\n- **Boiler** at position (-3.0, 2.5) - Not connected\n- **Steam engine** at position (1.5, 2.5) - Not connected\n- **Pipes** connecting offshore pump to boiler (8 pipes) and boiler to steam engine (18 pipes)\n\n### Power Generation System (New)\n- **Offshore pump** at position (-9.5, 19.5) - Working, connected to water system\n- **Boiler** at position (18.0, 22.5) - Working, fueled with coal\n- **Steam engine** at position (22.5, 22.5) - Working, connected to power network\n- **Pipes** (29 water pipes and 10 steam pipes) forming complete fluid system\n\n### Oil Extraction System\n- **Pumpjack** at position (17.5, 40.5) - Working, connected to power network\n- **Power poles** forming complete connection to power grid\n\n### Chemical Production Setup\n- **Chemical plant** at position (37.5, 22.5) - Powered but missing recipe\n- **Storage tank** at position (32.5, 22.5) - Empty, intended for petroleum gas\n- **Power poles** connecting chemical plant to network\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity placement issues\n- Verify target location is clear before placing entities (occurred multiple times with steam engines)\n- Check inventory for required items before placement (boiler placement attempt without inventory)\n- Ensure proper spacing between entities (steam engine placement conflicts)\n\n### Power system problems\n- Connect all power poles in continuous network (original steam engine not connected)\n- Verify fluid connections are complete (original boiler not receiving water)\n- Check fuel supply for boilers (original boiler had no coal)\n\n### Chemical plant setup\n- Assign recipe to chemical plant before expecting operation\n- Verify input/output connections for fluid handling\n- Ensure proper spacing for pipe connections (index error suggests connection point issue)\n\n### Programming errors\n- Import required modules (math module not imported)\n- Define all helper functions before use (find_clear_area not defined)\n- Verify array indices before access (chemical plant connection points index error)\n\n### System verification\n- Check entity status after placement but before assertion\n- Verify all system components are properly connected\n- Monitor fluid levels and power supply continuously\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Functions\n- `find_clear_area() -> Position` - Attempts to locate suitable building area (failed due to undefined function)\n- `connect_fluid_system(source: Entity, target: Entity, pipe_count: int) -> bool` - Connects fluid entities with pipes (successfully used in step 13)\n\n### Variables\n- `steam_engine_pos: Position` - Target position for steam engine placement\n- `land_pos: Position` - Selected location for boiler placement\n- `water_pos: Position` - Reference position for offshore pump"}
