{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (46.0, -82.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace at position (46.0, -82.0) that converts iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden chest at position (47.5, -81.5) collecting the produced iron plates.\nUpdate: Recently, 10 iron ore and 2 coal were inserted into the furnace to fuel the smelting process and facilitate production.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to insufficient resource availability\n- Verify that the required resource is present in your inventory before attempting to insert into an entity. Confirm that the expected resource (e.g., iron ore or coal) is available to avoid insertion failures.\n\n### Errors related to timing in processing cycles\n- Allow sufficient time for the processing cycle to complete so that outputs become available, avoiding premature extraction or insertion attempts.\n\n### Repeated mistakes with resource assertions\n- Confirm resource levels beforehand to prevent assertion failures. Check inventories and resource patches to guarantee that the required amounts are accessible prior to smelting operations.\n\n### Errors related to smelting output timeouts\n- Ensure that the inputs and furnace settings allow for the production of the expected output. Adjust timing waits or verify that the furnace is operating under optimal conditions to prevent smelting timeouts."}
