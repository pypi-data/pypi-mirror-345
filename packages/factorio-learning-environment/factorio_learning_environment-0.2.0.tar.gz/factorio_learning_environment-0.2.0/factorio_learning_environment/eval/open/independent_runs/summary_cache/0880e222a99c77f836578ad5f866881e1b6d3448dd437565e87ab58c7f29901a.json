{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, -60.0) fueled with coal, extracting iron ore and depositing into:\n  - **Wooden Chest** at position (4.5, -58.5) which stores iron ore.\n- **Furnaces** for smelting iron ore into iron plates:\n  - **Stone Furnace** at position (-15.0, -48.0) with coal as fuel, processing iron ore.\n  - **Stone Furnace** at position (-13.0, -48.0) with coal as fuel, processing iron ore.\n  - **Stone Furnace** at position (-11.0, -48.0) with coal as fuel, processing iron ore.\n- **Iron Chest** at position (-5.5, -50.5) storing iron ore and iron plates.\n\n### Storage Area\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Multiple **Wooden Chests** at positions (5.5, -60.5), (7.5, -60.5), (6.5, -60.5), (9.5, -60.5), (8.5, -60.5), and others, used for storing various resources and products.\n- **Iron Chest** at position (-5.5, -50.5) storing iron ore and iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Full Chests\n- Ensure chests are emptied regularly to prevent them from becoming full, which can halt production. The chest at position (4.5, -58.5) is full, preventing the mining drill from continuing its operation.\n\n### Errors with Inventory Management\n- Regularly monitor and manage inventory levels to ensure efficient resource processing and storage. Iron chests and wooden chests are full of iron plates, which could cause overflow and inefficiencies in production.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions defined or invoked in the provided steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `iron_ore_count: int` - Tracks the number of iron ore units extracted and stored.\n- `iron_plate_count: int` - Tracks the number of iron plates produced and stored.\n- `coal_count: int` - Tracks the amount of coal available for fueling furnaces and drills.\n\nThis report summarizes the current state of structures and highlights areas for improvement in resource management and production efficiency."}
