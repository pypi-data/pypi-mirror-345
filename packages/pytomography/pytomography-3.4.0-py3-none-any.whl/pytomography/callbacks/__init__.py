"""Callbacks can be used to compute various metrics on a reconstructed object throughout each iteration in an iterative reconstruction algorithm. For example, you may want to look at the noise in the liver as a function of iteration number in OSEM. A callback is simply a class which can take in an object and perform an operation. Callbacks are optional input to reconstruction algorithms; the ``run`` method of a callback is called after each subiteration of an iterative reconstruction algorithm. All user-defined callbacks should inherit from the base class ``CallBack``. A subclass of this class could be used to compute noise-bias curves provided the ``__init__`` method was redefined to take in some ground truth, and the run method was redefined to compare the obj to the ground truth.
