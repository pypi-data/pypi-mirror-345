{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at position (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump (position -9.5, -0.5)\n- Boiler (position -5.0, 2.5)\n- Steam engine (position 0.5, 6.5)\n- Connected with pipe network (positions -8.5,-0.5 to -5.5,0.5)\n- Small electric pole (position 0.5, 3.5)\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Operation at position (19.5, 74.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill (position 19.5, 74.5)\n- Wooden chest for ore collection (position 19.5, 76.5)\n- Two stone furnaces (positions 20.0, 78.0 and 23.0, 78.0)\n- Inserters (positions 21.5, 78.5 and 24.5, 78.5)\n- Output wooden chest (position 25.5, 78.5)\n- Connected with power poles (positions 10.5,45.5 to 31.5,46.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Placement collision errors\n- Check for existing entities before placing new ones, especially when using place_entity_next_to\n- Increase spacing when placing adjacent entities to avoid collisions\n- Consider different directions when placement fails in one direction\n\n### Distance-related placement errors\n- Move closer to the target position before attempting to place entities (max placement distance is 10 tiles)\n- Plan operations in local areas rather than trying to place entities far from current position\n\n### Belt connection errors\n- Transport belts cannot connect directly to furnaces - use inserters as intermediaries\n- Ensure proper input/output orientation when connecting machines with belts\n\n### Power connection issues\n- Verify inserter is connected to power network before expecting it to function\n- Check power pole placement to ensure full coverage of all electrical devices\n\n### Operational warnings to address\n- Empty full chests at mining drill drop positions to continue mining\n- Provide input materials to furnaces to begin smelting operations\n- Ensure inserters have valid pickup/drop positions and available items to transfer"}
