{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (5.5, 21.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (5.5, 21.5)\n- Boiler at position (-1.5, 24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-7.5, 25.5)\n- Pipe network connecting these components, including PipeGroups at various positions such as (-8.5, 23.5), (-7.5, 23.5), (-3.5, 23.5), (-1.5, 22.5), (0.5, 22.5), (3.5, 22.5), and (5.5, 18.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nConsists of:\n- Multiple Stone Furnaces at positions (0.0, 0.0), (10.0, 0.0), (13.0, 0.0), and (16.0, 0.0)\n- Burner Inserters at positions (8.5, 0.5), (17.5, 0.5), (19.5, 0.5), and (20.5, 0.5) for moving items between chests and furnaces\n- Wooden Chests at positions (8.5, -0.5), (17.5, -0.5), (19.5, -0.5), and (20.5, -0.5) for storing materials\n\n### Research Lab\n- Lab at position with input for automation science packs, but currently has no research in progress\n\n### Electricity Network\n- Small Electric Poles at positions (1.5, 2.5), (1.5, 6.5), (1.5, 14.5), (3.5, 20.5), and (1.5, 10.5) providing power distribution\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Pipes\n- Ensure that the target tile for placing a pipe is unoccupied before attempting to place it. Remove any existing entities that might be occupying the target position.\n\n### Steam Engine Not Functioning\n- Verify that all components of the electricity generator (offshore pump, boiler, steam engine) are correctly connected and that there is a continuous flow of water and steam.\n\n### Attribute Errors in Code\n- When using API calls, ensure that the correct attribute names are used. For instance, use `PipeGroup` instead of `PipeToGround` if that is the correct attribute.\n\n### Errors when Placing into a Tile Occupied by Another Entity\n- Before placing any entity, check that the target tile is free of other entities to avoid placement errors."}
