{"content": "# FACTORY REPORT\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System at (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, -0.5)\n- Boiler at position (-5.0, 2.5)\n- Steam engine at position (0.5, 6.5)\n- Connected with pipes for water and steam flow\n\n### Coal Mining Operation at (18.5, 11.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill at position (18.5, 11.5)\n- Wooden chest at position (18.5, 13.5) for coal collection\n- Connected to power grid\n\n### Oil Processing System at (17.5, 40.5)\nConsists of:\n- Pumpjack at position (17.5, 40.5) extracting crude oil\n- Oil refinery at position (24.5, 44.5) set to basic oil processing\n- Storage tank at position (30.5, 45.5) for petroleum gas\n- Connected with pipes and power\n\n### Plastic Production Facility at (36.5, 48.5)\nConsists of:\n- Chemical plant at position (36.5, 48.5) set to produce plastic bars\n- Coal input wooden chest at position (34.5, 46.5)\n- Coal inserter at position (35.5, 46.5) to feed coal from chest to chemical plant\n- Plastic output wooden chest at position (39.5, 48.5)\n- Output inserter at position (38.5, 48.5) to move plastic bars from chemical plant to chest\n- Connected to petroleum gas storage tank with pipes\n- Connected to power grid\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied spaces\n- Check for existing entities (especially pipes) before placing new entities\n- When using `place_entity_next_to`, consider increasing the spacing parameter if placement fails\n- Be aware of entity collision boxes that may extend beyond their visual representation\n\n### Errors when placing inserters near mining drills\n- Mining drills have a large collision box (3x3) that prevents inserters from being placed directly adjacent\n- Use a larger spacing parameter or choose a different direction when placing entities next to mining drills\n\n### Errors when connecting entities with pipes\n- Ensure that entities are properly aligned and within connection range\n- Some entities have specific connection points that must be respected\n- When connecting distant entities like boilers and steam engines, ensure a valid pipe path exists between them\n\n### Errors with power connections\n- Chemical plant showing \"NO_POWER\" status despite being near electric poles suggests power network issues\n- Ensure all machines are within the connection radius of electric poles\n- Check that the power generation system is working correctly and producing enough electricity\n\n### Production issues\n- When a machine shows \"ITEM_INGREDIENT_SHORTAGE\", ensure all required inputs are available\n- For recipes requiring multiple inputs (like plastic bars needing both coal and petroleum gas), verify all inputs are being supplied\n- Check that inserters are correctly oriented to pick up from source and drop into destination"}
