{"content": "I can see the error now. The key issue is that the furnace was placed at position x=-9.0 y=26.0, but we're trying to get it at position x=-11.5 y=24.5 (the iron_pos). This mismatch is causing the error.\n\nHere's the corrected version:\n\n```python\n# Check current inventory\ninventory = inspect_inventory()\nprint(f\"Current inventory: {inventory}\")\n\n# First craft a stone furnace if needed\nif inventory.get('stone-furnace', 0) == 0:\n    craft_item(Prototype.StoneFurnace)\nprint(\"Inventory after crafting:\", inspect_inventory())\n\n# First get some coal\ncoal_pos = nearest(Resource.Coal)\nmove_to(coal_pos)\ncoal_mined = harvest_resource(coal_pos, quantity=10)\nprint(f\"Harvested {coal_mined} coal\")\n\n# Now get iron ore\niron_pos = nearest(Resource.IronOre)\nmove_to(iron_pos)\niron_mined = harvest_resource(iron_pos, quantity=10)\nprint(f\"Harvested {iron_mined} iron ore\")\n\n# Place furnace and STORE ITS RETURNED POSITION\nfurnace = place_entity(Prototype.StoneFurnace, position=iron_pos)\nfurnace_position = furnace.position  # Store the actual position where the furnace was placed\nprint(f\"Placed furnace at: {furnace_position}\")\n\n# Insert fuel using the correct furnace position\ninsert_item(Prototype.Coal, furnace, quantity=5)\nfurnace = get_entity(Prototype.StoneFurnace, furnace_position)  # Use furnace_position\nprint(f\"Furnace state after adding fuel: {furnace}\")\n\n# Insert ore using the correct furnace position\ninsert_item(Prototype.IronOre, furnace, quantity=10)\nfurnace = get_entity(Prototype.StoneFurnace, furnace_position)  # Use furnace_position\nprint(f\"Furnace state after adding ore: {furnace}\")\n\n# Wait for smelting with verification using the correct furnace position\nfor _ in range(5):\n    furnace = get_entity(Prototype.StoneFurnace, furnace_position)  # Use furnace_position\n    if furnace.status == EntityStatus.WORKING:\n        print(\"Furnace is working!\")\n    sleep(1)\n\n# Final status check using the correct furnace position\nfurnace = get_entity(Prototype.StoneFurnace, furnace_position)  # Use furnace_position\nprint(f\"Final furnace state: {furnace}\")\nprint(f\"Final inventory: {inspect_inventory()}\")\n```\n\nKey lessons learned:\n1. Always store and use the actual position returned by place_entity, don't assume it will be exactly where you requested\n2. The position where an entity is placed might be slightly different from where you're standing\n3. Keep track of entity positions returned by API calls rather than using original target positions\n4. Print position values for debugging to catch position mismatches\n5. The API seems to adjust placement positions to valid grid locations, so we need to use those adjusted positions\n\nThese changes should resolve the \"entity not found\" error by using the correct position where the furnace was actually placed.", "summary_range": "[1-1762]"}
