{"content": "The error indicates that the player does not have a Stone Furnace in their inventory, which is required to place it on the map. Here's how you can address this issue:\n\n### Steps to Resolve\n\n1. **Craft a Stone Furnace:**\n   - To craft a Stone Furnace, you need a certain amount of Stone. Typically, it requires 5 Stone.\n   - First, ensure you have enough Stone in your inventory. If not, gather some from a nearby Stone resource.\n\n2. **Gather Stone:**\n   - Locate a Stone resource on the map.\n   - Move to the Stone resource and harvest enough Stone to craft a Stone Furnace.\n\n3. **Craft the Stone Furnace:**\n   - Use the crafting function to create a Stone Furnace once you have enough Stone.\n\n4. **Place the Stone Furnace:**\n   - After crafting, attempt to place the Stone Furnace again.\n\n### Example Code\n\n```python\n# Check if Stone is available in the inventory\ninventory = inspect_inventory()\nrequired_stone = 5\n\nif inventory.get(Prototype.Stone, 0) < required_stone:\n    # Locate and gather Stone\n    stone_position = nearest(Resource.Stone)\n    move_to(stone_position)\n    harvest_resource(stone_position, required_stone)\n\n# Craft the Stone Furnace\ncraft(Prototype.StoneFurnace)\n\n# Verify the Stone Furnace is in the inventory\ninventory = inspect_inventory()\nassert inventory.get(Prototype.StoneFurnace, 0) > 0, \"Failed to craft Stone Furnace.\"\n\n# Move to a suitable position to place the Stone Furnace\nstone_furnace_position = current_position.right().down()\nmove_to(stone_furnace_position)\n\n# Place the Stone Furnace\nfurnace = place_entity(Prototype.StoneFurnace, position=stone_furnace_position)\n\n# Add fuel and iron ore to the furnace\nfuel = Prototype.Coal if inventory.get(Prototype.Coal, 0) > 0 else Prototype.Wood\ninsert_item(fuel, furnace, 10)\ninsert_item(Prototype.IronOre, furnace, 10)\n\n# Wait for the smelting process to complete\nsleep(5)\n\n# Extract iron plates from the furnace\nextract_item(Prototype.IronPlate, furnace.position, 10)\n\n# Verify iron plates in the player's inventory\ninventory = inspect_inventory()\nassert inventory[Prototype.IronPlate] >= 10, f\"Iron plates extraction failed; current inventory: {inventory}\"\n```\n\n### Tips\n- **Resource Management:** Always check your inventory before attempting to place or craft items to ensure you have the necessary resources.\n- **Proximity Awareness:** Ensure you are close enough to the desired location when placing entities, as there are distance restrictions.\n- **Crafting:** Familiarize yourself with the crafting requirements for basic items to streamline the process of setting up initial automation.", "summary_range": "[1-6]"}
