{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (-15.0, -48.0) with fuel inventory containing coal and a furnace source of iron ore.\n- Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0) with fuel inventory containing coal and a furnace source of iron ore.\n- Furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0) with fuel inventory containing coal. This furnace has warnings indicating \"no ingredients to smelt\" and \"furnace fuel source is full\".\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage at Position (4.0, -60.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (4.0, -60.0) with fuel inventory containing coal, currently working, and a warning that the \"chest at drop position is full\".\n- Wooden Chest at position (4.5, -58.5) containing iron ore.\n- Multiple Wooden Chests positioned at (5.5, -60.5), (7.5, -60.5), (6.5, -60.5), (9.5, -60.5), and (8.5, -60.5), all with empty inventories.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors when inserting items without sufficient inventory\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. For example, attempting to insert coal into a furnace without having coal in the inventory resulted in an error.\n\n### Errors due to full output slots\n- Regularly check and clear the output slots of entities like furnaces and mining drills to prevent warnings and ensure continuous operation. For instance, the burner mining drill cannot continue mining if the chest at the drop position is full.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - `insert_item`: Attempts to insert a specified quantity of an item into a target entity. Failure occurs if the item is not present in the inventory.\n  \n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `furnace`: Represents a furnace entity, used in the context of inserting items.\n  - `inventory`: Dictates the current inventory status, e.g., `{'wooden-chest': 3, 'coal': 5, 'iron-plate': 5340, 'iron-gear-wheel': 4}`."}
