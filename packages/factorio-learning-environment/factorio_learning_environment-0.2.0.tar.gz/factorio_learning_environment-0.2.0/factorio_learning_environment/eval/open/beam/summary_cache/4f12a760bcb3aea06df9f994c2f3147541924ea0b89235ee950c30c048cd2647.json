The updated status shows:\n\n### Updated Furnace Status:\n1. **First Existing Furnace (Position: x=0.0, y=0.0)**:\n   - Holds **1 piece of iron ore** and has produced **1 piece of iron plate**.\n   - Status: **\"WORKING.\"**\n\n2. **Second Existing Furnace (Position: x=2.0, y=0.0)**:\n   - Now holds **4 pieces of iron ore** and has produced **2 pieces of iron plates**.\n   - Status: **\"WORKING.\"**\n\n3. **Newly Placed Furnace (Position: x=4.0, y=-1.0)**:\n   - Status: **\"NO_INGREDIENTS,\"** with no materials to process.\n\n### Current Overall Inventory:\n- **Stone Furnaces**: 3\n- **Coal**: 1 (remaining)\n- **Iron Ore**: 5 (in total)\n- **Copper Ore**: 20 \n- **Iron Plates**: 8 (total available)\n- **Copper Plates**: 7 \n- **Copper Cables**: 15\n- **Iron Gear Wheels**: 13\n- **Electronic Circuit**: 1.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Monitor Production**: Both the first and second existing furnaces are operational and producing iron plates. I should keep an eye on their outputs.\n2. **Address the Newly Placed Furnace**: It remains idle due to lack of ingredients. I should consider transferring iron ore or coal if needed.\n3. **Plan for Future Crafting**: With iron plates being produced, I can start planning for crafting more advanced items or expanding production lines.\n\n### Let's check the production output of both working furnaces after a brief wait to see how many iron plates they can produce.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Wait for a short period to allow both furnaces to process and produce iron plates\nsleep(5)  # Wait for 5 seconds\n\n# Verify the status of both existing furnaces and note any production outputs.\nfirst_existing_furnace_status = inspect_inventory(first_existing_furnace)\nsecond_existing_furnace_status = inspect_inventory(second_existing_furnace)\n\nprint(f\"Production output of the first existing furnace after waiting: {first_existing_furnace_status}\")  # Check the inventory after a brief wait\nprint(f\"Production output of the second existing furnace after waiting: {second_existing_furnace_status}\")  # Check the second furnace inventory after a brief wait\nprint(f\"Current overall inventory after waiting: {inspect_inventory()}\")  # Check overall inventory status after waiting\nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")  # Verify entity states again.", "summary_range": "[1-362]"}
