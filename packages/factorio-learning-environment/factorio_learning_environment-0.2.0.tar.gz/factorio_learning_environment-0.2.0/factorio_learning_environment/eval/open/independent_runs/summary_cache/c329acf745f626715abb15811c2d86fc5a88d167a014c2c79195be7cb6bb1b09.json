Verify that the targeted PipeGroup exists, is active, and that its fluid_system ID matches the current pipeline configuration (e.g. using one from the updated network such as fluid_system=16964).\n  \n\u2022 Inefficient Pipeline Stabilization:\n  - Replace fixed 10-second wait intervals with dynamic status checks to confirm pipeline readiness before attempting reconnections, thereby reducing idle time."}
