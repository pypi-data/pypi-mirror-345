{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Setup at (-15, -50)\nConsists of:\n- Two burner mining drills at positions (-19.0, -50.0) and (-15.0, -50.0)\n- Two wooden chests at positions (-18.5, -48.5) and (-14.5, -48.5) collecting ore from the drills\nBoth drills are operational and mining iron ore, powered by coal\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line at (0, 0)\nConsists of:\n- Two stone furnaces at positions (0.0, 0.0) and (2.0, 0.0)\n- Two input wooden chests at positions (-2.5, 0.5) and (4.5, 0.5) holding iron ore\n- Two burner inserters at positions (-1.5, 0.5) and (3.5, 0.5) transferring ore from chests to furnaces\nThe furnaces are operational and smelting iron plates, powered by coal\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Building Box Calculations\n- Fix the type error when calculating building dimensions by ensuring proper numeric values are used instead of model attributes\n\n### Errors with Resource Requirements\n- Check if required items are in inventory before attempting to craft or place (wooden chests, burner mining drills)\n- Gather raw resources like wood before attempting to craft items that require them\n\n### Placement Distance Errors\n- Move closer to target location before placing entities - maximum placement distance is 10 units\n- Current position was too far (65.51 units) when trying to place chest\n\n### Entity Placement Conflicts\n- Check if target position is clear before placing entities\n- When placing entities next to existing ones, ensure proper spacing to avoid overlaps\n- Verify the terrain is suitable for placement (not water or other unplaceable surfaces)\n\n### Resource Area Requirements\n- Ensure mining drills are placed over resource patches\n- Verify the entire mining area of the drill overlaps with resources\n\n### Inventory Management\n- Verify required materials are in inventory before inserting into entities\n- Monitor chest capacity to prevent mining stoppage due to full output chests"}
