{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining Operation at position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (position x=41.0, y=-82.0) mining coal\n- Wooden chest (position x=40.5, y=-83.5) collecting the output\n- The drill is operational with coal as fuel and is successfully outputting coal to the chest\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Operation at position (3.0, -73.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (position x=3.0, y=-73.0) mining iron ore\n- The drill is operational with coal as fuel but has a warning that output is blocked as there is no sink entity to accept the output\n\n### Iron Smelting Setup at position (6.0, -73.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace (position x=6.0, y=-73.0)\n- The furnace has fuel (coal) but no ingredients to smelt\n\n### Manual Smelting Station at position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace (position x=0.0, y=0.0)\n- The furnace has been used to smelt iron ore into iron plates\n- Currently has no ingredients to smelt\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when trying to place entities without having them in inventory\n- Make sure to craft required entities before attempting to place them\n- Check inventory contents before attempting to place entities\n\n### Errors when trying to craft items without required raw materials\n- Ensure you have gathered all necessary raw resources (like wood) before attempting to craft items that require them\n- Some materials (like wood) cannot be crafted and must be gathered from the environment\n\n### Errors when trying to craft items requiring smelting\n- Items like iron plates cannot be directly crafted and require smelting in a furnace\n- Set up proper smelting operations before attempting to craft items requiring processed materials\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied spaces\n- When placing entities next to other entities, ensure there is enough space\n- Pay attention to the size of entities (mining drills are 2x2 tiles) when planning placement\n- Consider increasing spacing, changing direction, or changing reference position when placing entities near each other\n\n### Errors with mining drill output\n- Mining drills need a proper output destination (chest, belt, or directly into a machine)\n- The iron mining drill has a warning about blocked output - ensure there's a valid destination for the mined resources"}
