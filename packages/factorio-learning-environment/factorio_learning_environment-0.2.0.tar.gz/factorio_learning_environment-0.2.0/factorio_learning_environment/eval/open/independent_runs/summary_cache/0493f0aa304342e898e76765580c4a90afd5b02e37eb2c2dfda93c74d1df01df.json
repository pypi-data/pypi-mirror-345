{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Stone brick production at position (-50.0, 0.0)\nConsists of following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at (-50.0, 0.0) facing RIGHT mining stone\n- Stone furnace at (-45.0, 0.0) smelting stone bricks\n- Burner inserter at (-47.5, 0.5) moving stone from belts to furnace\n- Transport belt at (-48.5, 0.5) carrying stone from drill to inserter\n\nCurrent status:\n- Drill output blocked (no valid output path)\n- Furnace has no ingredients\n- Inserter waiting for source items\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Belt placement errors\n- Repeated attempts to place belts at (-46.0, 1.0) and (-48.0, 0.0) failed due to:\n  - Existing entities blocking placement\n  - Potentially unplaceable terrain (water)\n- Solutions:\n  - Verify target position is clear before placing belts\n  - Use remove_entity() to clear obstructions first\n  - Check terrain suitability (avoid water tiles)\n\n#### Inserter placement issues\n- Failed to place output inserter at (-42.5, 0.0) due to existing object\n- Always:\n  - Check target position before placing inserters\n  - Maintain proper spacing between entities (1 tile minimum)\n\n#### Production chain failures\n- Current system not functional due to:\n  - Drill output blocked (no valid belt connection)\n  - Missing output inserter for furnace\n  - No stone reaching furnace\n- Fix by:\n  - Completing belt connections from drill to furnace\n  - Adding output inserter and chest for bricks\n  - Ensuring coal supply for all burner entities\n\n#### Inventory management\n- Attempted to insert stone into furnace with none in inventory\n- Always verify required items are in inventory before insertion attempts\n\n#### Entity status monitoring\n- Critical warnings present:\n  - Drill: \"output blocked by item on the ground\"\n  - Furnace: \"no ingredients to smelt\"\n  - Inserter: \"waiting for source items\"\n- Must address all status warnings for production to function\n\n#### Placement persistence\n- Repeated same placement errors multiple times\n- Implement error checking before placement attempts\n- Log and learn from failed placements to avoid repetition"}
