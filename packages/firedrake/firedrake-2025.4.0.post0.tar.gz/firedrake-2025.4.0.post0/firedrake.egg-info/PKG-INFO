Firedrake is an automated system for the portable solution of partial
differential equations using the finite element method (FEM). Firedrake
enables users to employ a wide range of discretisations to an infinite
variety of PDEs and obtain high performance code on CPUs.

For more information on Firedrake, please see https://www.firedrakeproject.org.
