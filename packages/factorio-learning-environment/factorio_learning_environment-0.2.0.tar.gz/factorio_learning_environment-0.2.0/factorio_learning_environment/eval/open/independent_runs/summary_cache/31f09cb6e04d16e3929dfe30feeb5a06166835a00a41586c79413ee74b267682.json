{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Mining Operations\n1. Coal Mining Setup at (41.0, -82.0)\n- Burner mining drill without fuel\n\n2. Iron/Copper Mining Complex at (-92.0 area)\n- Multiple burner mining drills at (43.0, -92.0), (46.0, -92.0)\n- Wooden chests at (40.5, -90.5), (43.5, -90.5), (46.5, -90.5) for collection\n\n3. Copper Mining Setup\n- Burner mining drill at (-18.0, -53.0)\n- Collection chest at (-17.5, -51.5)\n- Additional chest at (-20.5, -71.5) containing 2 copper ore\n\n### Power/Water Infrastructure\n1. Water Pumping Station at (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Offshore pump working with water output\n- Connected to fluid system 1555\n\n2. Pipe Network System\n- Multiple pipe groups:\n  - System 1539: 56 pipes around (-24.5, 11.5)\n  - System 1548: 9 pipes around (-13.5, 12.5)\n  - System 1555: 12 pipes around (-16.5, 19.5) carrying water\n  - System 1554: Single pipe at (-16.5, 19.5)\n  - System 1558: 6 pipes around (-9.5, 20.5)\n  - System 1563: 13 pipes around (-2.5, 26.5)\n\n3. Electrical Grid (ID: 753)\n- Multiple electric poles forming a network\n- Key positions: (0.5, 18.5), (-16.5, 15.5), (9.5, 3.5)\n- Currently at 0 voltage\n\n4. Research Facility\n- Lab with 15 automation science packs\n- Currently unpowered\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Issues\n- When placing steam engines, ensure the target location is clear of other entities\n- Check for existing pipe networks that might block placement of new structures\n\n### Connection Problems\n- When connecting entities (like boilers to steam engines), ensure connection points are not blocked\n- Plan the layout of fluid-carrying entities before placement to ensure proper connections\n\n### Resource Collection Issues\n- Verify resources are actually being collected after mining operations\n- Implement proper inventory checks before and after mining operations\n\n### Fuel Management\n- Ensure mining drills have fuel before attempting mining operations\n- Implement proper fuel insertion verification\n- Keep track of fuel levels in burner mining drills\n\n### Recipe and Crafting Issues\n- When crafting complex items (like boilers), ensure all prerequisites are available\n- For items requiring raw resources (like stone), gather these before attempting to craft dependent items\n\n### Entity Removal\n- Verify entity existence before attempting to remove or pick up\n- Double check coordinates when attempting to remove specific entities"}
