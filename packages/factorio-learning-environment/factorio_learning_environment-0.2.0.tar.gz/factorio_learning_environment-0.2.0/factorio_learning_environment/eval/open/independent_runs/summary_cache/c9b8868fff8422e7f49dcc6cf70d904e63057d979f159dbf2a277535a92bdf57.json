{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (-1.5, 24.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe Group connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine, with key positions including (-9.5, 23.5), (-7.5, 23.5), and (-3.5, 22.5)\n- Small electric poles at positions (0.5, 21.5), (-0.5, 26.5), (-1.5, 26.5), and (0.5, 26.5) for power distribution\n\n### Iron and Copper Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0) for smelting\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) to move items\n- Wooden Chest at Position (6.5, -59.5) for storage\n\n### Laboratory at Position (6.5, -60.5)\nConsists of:\n- Lab with input for automation science packs, currently not powered\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Lack of Power\n- Ensure all entities that require electricity are connected to a functioning power network. Check connections between the steam engine and the power poles to ensure they are complete and functional.\n\n### Errors with Fuel Supply\n- Maintain a consistent fuel supply to boilers to prevent them from running out of fuel. Regularly check and refuel as necessary.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Power\n- Ensure inserters are connected to a power source. Verify that the inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) is properly connected to the power network to avoid power-related issues.\n\n### Errors with Smelting Ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. The stone furnace at position (6.0, -62.0) is currently lacking ingredients, so ensure a steady supply of raw materials."}
