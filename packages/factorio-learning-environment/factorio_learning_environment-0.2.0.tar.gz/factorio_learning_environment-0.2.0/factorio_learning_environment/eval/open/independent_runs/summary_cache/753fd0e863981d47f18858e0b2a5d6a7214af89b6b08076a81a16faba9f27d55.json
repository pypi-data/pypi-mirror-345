{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining Operation at Position (x=53.0, y=-83.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=53.0, y=-83.0) extracting coal.\n- Wooden Chests at positions (x=52.5, y=-84.5) and (x=54.5, y=-84.5) for storing coal.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining Operation at Position (x=-23.0, y=-68.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-23.0, y=-68.0) extracting copper ore.\n- Transport Belts and a Wooden Chest at position (x=-23.5, y=-69.5) for ore transportation and storage.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Operation at Position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden Chests at positions (x=-14.5, y=-54.5) and (x=-12.5, y=-54.5) for storing iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-54.5) transferring iron ore between chests.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (x=-20.0, y=-70.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-20.0, y=-70.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-20.5, y=-63.5) storing iron plates.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=1.5, y=0.5) storing iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source chest or entity has items available for the inserter to pick up. Check inventory levels and refuel or restock as necessary.\n\n### Chest is Full\n- Regularly check and clear out chests to prevent them from becoming full, which can halt production lines. Consider using additional storage or logistics to manage overflow.\n\n### No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Ensure that furnaces have a continuous supply of raw materials to maintain production. Use inserters and belts to automate the supply chain effectively."}
