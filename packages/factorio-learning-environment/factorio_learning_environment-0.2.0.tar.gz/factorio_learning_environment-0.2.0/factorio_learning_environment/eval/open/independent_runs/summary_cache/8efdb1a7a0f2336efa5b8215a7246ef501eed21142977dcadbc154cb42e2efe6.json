{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Iron Ore Storage**: Iron chest at position (x=-5.5, y=-50.5) storing iron ore.\n- **Furnaces**: \n  - Furnace at position (x=-15.0, y=-48.0)\n  - Furnace at position (x=-13.0, y=-48.0)\n  - Furnace at position (x=-11.0, y=-48.0)\n- **Iron Plate Storage**: Multiple wooden chests at positions:\n  - (x=-11.5, y=-50.5), (x=-10.5, y=-50.5), (x=-9.5, y=-50.5), (x=-8.5, y=-50.5) with warnings of being full.\n  - (x=-7.5, y=-50.5) partially filled with iron plates.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill**: Positioned at (x=4.0, y=-60.0) with a drop position at (x=4.5, y=-58.5).\n- **Storage Chests**: \n  - Wooden chest at drop position (x=4.5, y=-58.5) storing iron ore.\n  - Additional wooden chests at positions (x=5.5, y=-60.5), (x=7.5, y=-60.5), (x=6.5, y=-60.5), (x=9.5, y=-60.5), (x=8.5, y=-60.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Full Storage Chests\n- Ensure that storage chests are emptied regularly to prevent mining drills from stopping due to full chests. The chest at (x=4.5, y=-58.5) is full, halting the mining process.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Operations\n- Regularly check and manage the inventory of furnaces to ensure they have sufficient resources and are not overloaded with input materials.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `iron_ore_inventory`: Dict[str, int] = {'iron-ore': 567, 'iron-plate': 1400}\n- `furnace_positions`: List[Tuple[float, float]] = [(-15.0, -48.0), (-13.0, -48.0), (-11.0, -48.0)]\n- `chest_positions`: List[Tuple[float, float]] = [(-11.5, -50.5), (-10.5, -50.5), (-9.5, -50.5), (-8.5, -50.5), (-7.5, -50.5)]\n- `burner_mining_drill_position`: Tuple[float, float] = (4.0, -60.0)"}
