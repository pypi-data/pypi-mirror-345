Verify the alignment and connection of pipes leading from the offshore pump to the boiler.\n\n### Steam Engine Connection Errors\n- Check that the steam engine is connected to the power network and has a supply of steam. Ensure that the boiler is functioning and connected to the steam engine.\n\n### Inserter Power Errors\n- Ensure that inserters are connected to a powered electric network. Verify the connection and placement of electric poles to provide power to inserters.\n\n### General Connection Tips\n- Regularly check connections between entities to ensure they are properly aligned and functional. Misalignment can lead to entities not working as intended."}
