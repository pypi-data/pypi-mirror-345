Instead, inspect the fluid systems or connection points to determine connectivity.\n\n### Errors due to undefined names\n- Ensure that all names are defined before using them.\n\n### Errors when accessing 'position' attribute of a 'Position' object\n- The 'position' attribute does not exist for 'Position' objects. Use the object directly instead.\n\n### Errors when connecting entities with invalid connection points\n- Ensure that the connection points are valid and not blocked before attempting to connect entities.\n\n## NAMESPACE\nNo utility functions have been defined by the agent."}
