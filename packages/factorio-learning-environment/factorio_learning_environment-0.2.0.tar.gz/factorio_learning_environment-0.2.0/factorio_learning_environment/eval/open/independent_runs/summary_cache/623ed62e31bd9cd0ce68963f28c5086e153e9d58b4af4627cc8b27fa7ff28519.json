{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Plate Production at (-28, -61)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-28, -61) mining copper ore\n- Stone furnace at (-28, -59) smelting copper plates\n- Burner inserter at (-25.5, -58.5) moving plates to chest\n- Wooden chest at (-27.5, -57.5) for output storage\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Complex at (-10, -59)\nConsists of three mining drills in a row:\n- Burner mining drill at (-10, -59) with chest at (-9.5, -57.5)\n- Burner mining drill at (-8, -59) with chest at (-7.5, -57.5)\n- Burner mining drill at (-6, -59) with chest at (-5.5, -57.5)\nAll drills are mining iron ore and outputting to their respective chests\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line at (0, 0)\nConsists of four parallel smelting setups:\n1. First setup:\n   - Stone furnace at (0, 0)\n   - Input inserter at (0.5, -1.5)\n   - Output inserter at (0.5, 1.5)\n   - Input chest at (0.5, -2.5)\n   - Output chest at (0.5, 2.5)\n\n2. Second setup:\n   - Stone furnace at (2, 0)\n   - Input inserter at (2.5, -1.5)\n   - Output inserter at (2.5, 1.5)\n   - Input chest at (2.5, -2.5)\n   - Output chest at (2.5, 2.5)\n\n3. Third setup:\n   - Stone furnace at (4, 0)\n   - Input inserter at (4.5, -1.5)\n   - Output inserter at (4.5, 1.5)\n   - Input chest at (4.5, -2.5)\n   - Output chest at (4.5, 2.5)\n\n4. Fourth setup:\n   - Stone furnace at (6, 0)\n   - Input inserter at (6.5, -1.5)\n   - Output inserter at (6.5, 1.5)\n   - Input chest at (6.5, -2.5)\n   - Output chest at (6.5, 2.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Conflicts\n- When placing inserters or other entities, check if the target position is already occupied by another entity\n- Ensure proper spacing between entities, especially when placing inserters next to larger entities like mining drills\n- Consider the tile dimensions of entities when planning placement (mining drills take 2x2 tiles, furnaces 2x2, inserters 1x1)\n\n### Output Blocking Issues\n- Ensure there is a proper output entity (like a chest or belt) to collect products from mining drills to prevent \"output blocked\" warnings\n- Plan the layout to include appropriate item collection methods for all production entities"}
