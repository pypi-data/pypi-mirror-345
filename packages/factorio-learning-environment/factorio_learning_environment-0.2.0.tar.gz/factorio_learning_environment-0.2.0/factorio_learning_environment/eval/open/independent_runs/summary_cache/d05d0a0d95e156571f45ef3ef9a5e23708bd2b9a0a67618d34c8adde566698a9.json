{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nNo structures have been successfully created on the map as of the latest execution steps. The agent attempted to place various entities, but none were successfully placed due to errors or restrictions.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities on non-buildable tiles\n- Ensure that the target position for placing entities such as Stone Furnaces, Wooden Chests, and Transport Belts is buildable. Check the terrain and any existing restrictions before attempting to place an entity.\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Verify that the tile is unoccupied before placing an entity. Attempting to place entities like Wooden Chests and Transport Belts on occupied tiles will result in placement failure.\n\n### Errors due to lack of resources for operation\n- Ensure that there is a sufficient supply of necessary resources, such as coal for Stone Furnaces, before attempting to operate or place entities that require them. Lack of resources will prevent the entity from functioning correctly.\n\n### Errors due to incorrect initial setup\n- Before placing any entities, confirm that the environment is correctly initialized and that there are no global build restrictions that could prevent placement. Conduct thorough checks of the environment settings and responsiveness to avoid unnecessary errors."}
