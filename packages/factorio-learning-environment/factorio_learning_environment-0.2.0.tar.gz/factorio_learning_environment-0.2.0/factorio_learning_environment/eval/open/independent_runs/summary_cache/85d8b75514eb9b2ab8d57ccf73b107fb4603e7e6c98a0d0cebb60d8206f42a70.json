Move closer to the entity and verify its status before attempting extraction.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Check that the source chest or entity contains items that the inserter can pick up. Ensure the inserter is correctly positioned and configured to pick up items from the intended source.\n\n### Errors with Mining Drills Out of Fuel\n- Regularly check and refuel mining drills to ensure continuous operation. Monitor fuel levels and replenish as necessary to avoid interruptions in resource extraction.\n\n### Errors with Furnaces Lacking Ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Regularly supply furnaces with raw materials to maintain production efficiency."}
