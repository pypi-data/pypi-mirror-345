{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line (Position x=1-3, y=1-3.5)\nConsists of:\n- Two stone furnaces at (x=1.0, y=1.0) and (x=3.0, y=1.0)\n- Two burner inserters at (x=1.5, y=2.5) and (x=3.5, y=2.5)\n- Two wooden chests at (x=1.5, y=3.5) and (x=3.5, y=3.5) storing iron plates\n- Additional wooden chest and burner inserter setup at (x=5.5, y=3.5) and (x=5.5, y=2.5)\n\n### Copper Plate Production Line (Position x=2-4, y=7-9.5)\nConsists of:\n- Two stone furnaces at (x=2.0, y=7.0) and (x=4.0, y=7.0)\n- Four burner inserters at (x=2.5, y=8.5), (x=4.5, y=8.5), (x=3.5, y=9.5), and (x=4.5, y=8.5)\n- Two wooden chests at (x=2.5, y=9.5) and (x=4.5, y=9.5)\n- Transport belt system connecting furnaces to chests\n\n### Assembly Line System (Position x=14-21, y=11-15)\nConsists of:\n- Two assembling machines at (x=14.5, y=14.5) and (x=21.5, y=15.5)\n- Multiple wooden chests at (x=14.5, y=11.5), (x=21.5, y=11.5), (x=11.5, y=13.5), (x=17.5, y=14.5)\n- Multiple burner inserters connecting chests to assembling machines\n- Complex belt system for material transport\n\n### Power Generation System (Position x=2-13, y=35)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at (x=2.5, y=35.5)\n- Boiler at (x=7.0, y=35.5)\n- Steam engine at (x=13.5, y=35.5)\n- Pipe network connecting components\n- Electricity distribution network with multiple poles\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Fuel Management Issues\n- Ensure sufficient coal is available in inventory before attempting to insert fuel into machines\n- Keep track of fuel levels in burner inserters and boilers to prevent operation interruptions\n\n### Resource Flow Issues\n- Multiple inserters are waiting for source items - ensure proper material flow through the production line\n- Some chests are reported as full - consider adding more storage or improving item extraction\n\n### Production Bottlenecks\n- Assembling machines lacking required ingredients (copper plate, iron plate, copper cable) - ensure proper supply chain\n- Some furnaces have no ingredients to smelt - maintain consistent ore supply\n\n### Fluid System Management\n- One offshore pump has no fluid connections - ensure proper pipe connections for all fluid-handling entities\n- Monitor steam and water flow in the power generation system to maintain consistent electricity production"}
