{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) fueled with coal, extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-15.5, y=-48.5) storing extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0) processing iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-46.5) collecting produced iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5) transferring iron plates from the furnace to the output chest.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when extracting items from non-existent or empty entities\n- Ensure the target entity exists and contains the required items before attempting to extract. For example, check that the wooden chest contains iron ore before extraction.\n\n### Errors when inserting into full inventories\n- Verify the target inventory has enough space before attempting to insert items. For instance, ensure the stone furnace is not full before inserting coal.\n\n### Errors when placing entities without required items\n- Confirm that you have the necessary items in your inventory before placing an entity. For example, ensure you have a wooden chest in your inventory before trying to place it.\n\n### Errors when crafting items with unavailable resources\n- Gather all required raw resources before crafting items. For instance, collect wood before attempting to craft a wooden chest."}
