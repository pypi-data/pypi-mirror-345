{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Transport System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (40.0, -84.0) with a transport belt network leading from position (41.5, -85.5) to (41.5, -80.5).\n- Transport belts connecting various positions to facilitate coal movement.\n- Burner Inserter at position (40.5, -82.5) transferring items from the mining drill to a transport belt.\n- Wooden chests at positions (40.5, -81.5) and (42.5, -80.5) for item collection.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -49.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- BeltGroup connecting the furnace to other parts of the production line.\n\n### Belt Network\nMultiple BeltGroups are present, facilitating item transport across different sections:\n- BeltGroup with inputs and outputs facilitating coal and item transport between positions (50.5, -86.5) and (47.5, -86.5).\n- Additional BeltGroups connecting various positions to ensure smooth transport of resources.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure there is no existing object in the way before attempting to place a new entity. If an error occurs stating \"Could not place wooden-chest,\" verify that the target location is clear of other objects.\n\n### Errors due to inventory shortages\n- Check inventory before attempting to place an entity. If an error indicates \"No wooden_chest in inventory,\" ensure you have the necessary items in your inventory before proceeding.\n\n### Misalignment of transport systems\n- Ensure that the drill drop position is aligned with the transport belt to avoid errors like \"Drill drop position is not aligned with the transport belt.\" Adjust the position of the drill or belt as necessary to maintain alignment.\n\n### Output Blockage Warnings\n- Clear any items blocking the output of drills or inserters to prevent warnings like \"output blocked by item on the ground.\" Regularly check and clear the output paths to maintain efficiency."}
