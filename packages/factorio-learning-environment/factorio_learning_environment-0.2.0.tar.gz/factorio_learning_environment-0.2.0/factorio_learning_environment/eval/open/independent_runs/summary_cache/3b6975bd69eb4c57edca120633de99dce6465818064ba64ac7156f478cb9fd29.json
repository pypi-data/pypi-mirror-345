{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 19.5)\nConsists of:\n- **Steam Engine** at position (-5.5, 19.5)\n- **Boiler** at position (-2.5, 24.0)\n- **Offshore Pump** at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- **Pipe Group** connecting the boiler to the steam engine, with pipes at positions:\n  - (x=-5.5, y=16.5)\n  - (x=-4.5, y=16.5)\n  - (x=-3.5, y=16.5)\n  - ... (continuing to connect the boiler and steam engine)\n\n### Iron Plate Production at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Undefined Variables and Incorrect References\n- Ensure all variables are defined before use. For instance, `steam_engine_buildable_area` was not defined, leading to a `NameError`.\n\n### Type Errors in Calculations\n- When performing arithmetic operations, ensure that all operands are of compatible types. The error with `steam_engine_width + 4` indicates a mismatch between operand types.\n\n### Crafting Errors Due to Missing Ingredients\n- Before crafting, verify that all required ingredients are available in the inventory. Missing ingredients like iron plates or iron gear wheels can lead to crafting failures.\n\n### Inventory Management for Crafting\n- Ensure that the inventory contains the necessary items before attempting to craft or insert items. For example, attempting to insert coal without having it in the inventory resulted in an error.\n\n### Connection Errors Between Entities\n- Verify that you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to connect entities. The failure to connect pipes between the boiler and steam engine was due to a lack of pipes in the inventory.\n\n### Placement Errors\n- Ensure that the entity you are trying to place is available in your inventory. Errors occurred when attempting to place a steam engine without having one in the inventory."}
