{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) fueled with coal, currently not smelting due to lack of ingredients.\n- Stone Furnace at position (2.0, 0.0) fueled with coal, currently not smelting due to lack of ingredients.\n- Burner Inserter at position (1.5, 1.5) with a pickup position at (0.5, 1.5) and drop position at (2.5, 1.5), waiting for source items.\n- Burner Inserter at position (3.5, 1.5) with a pickup position at (2.5, 1.5) and drop position at (4.5, 1.5), waiting for source items.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Chest Placement and Inspection\n- Ensure that the wooden chests are placed correctly on the map. The logs indicate repeated errors in inspecting chests at positions (2.5, 1.5), (4.5, 1.5), (2.5, 2.5), and (4.5, 2.5). Verify the placement of chests before attempting to inspect them.\n- Double-check that the positions you are inspecting actually contain the intended entities. If an entity is not found at a specified position, it may not have been placed correctly or may have been removed.\n- When inspecting chests, ensure that the variable names used in your code (e.g., `first_chest`, `second_chest`) are correctly defined and correspond to the entities you intend to inspect."}
