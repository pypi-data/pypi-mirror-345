{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line (around position x=0-6, y=-2.5 to 2.5)\nComplex production line consisting of:\n- 4 wooden chests at y=-2.5 (x positions: 0.5, 2.5, 4.5, 6.5) containing coal\n- 4 burner inserters at y=-1.5 feeding from chests to furnaces\n- 4 stone furnaces at y=0 (x positions: 0.0, 2.0, 4.0, 6.0)\n- 4 wooden chests at y=1.5-2.5 for output storage\n- Additional burner inserters moving products between furnaces and output chests\nThe structure is set up as a line of furnaces with automated coal feeding and product collection\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Setup (around position x=-10 to -5, y=-59)\nMining operation consisting of:\n- 3 burner mining drills at y=-59 (x positions: -10.5, -8.0, -6.0) mining iron ore\n- 2 stone furnaces at y=-57 (x positions: -9.0, -5.0) for smelting\nAll drills and furnaces are fueled with coal and actively mining/processing iron ore\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when trying to place entities in occupied positions\n- Check if a position is already occupied before attempting to place new entities\n- Remove existing entities if you need to place something in their position\n- Use entity detection to verify placement locations are free\n\n### Errors related to missing resources\n- Ensure you have the required items in inventory before attempting to insert them\n- Check coal availability before attempting to fuel entities\n- Gather necessary resources before starting construction operations\n\n### Entity output blocking issues\n- Mining drills show warnings about blocked outputs\n- Ensure proper connection between mining drills and their destination entities\n- Set up proper item transport systems between entities to prevent output blocking"}
