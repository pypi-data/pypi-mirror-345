{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (5.5, 21.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (5.5, 21.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-1.5, 24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-7.5, 25.5)\n- PipeGroup connections between the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine, with various positions such as (-8.5, 23.5), (-1.5, 22.5), (0.5, 22.5), (3.5, 22.5), and others.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nConsists of:\n- Multiple Stone Furnaces at Positions (0.0, 0.0), (10.0, 0.0), (13.0, 0.0), and (16.0, 0.0)\n- Burner Inserters at Positions (8.5, 0.5), (17.5, 0.5), (19.5, 0.5), and (20.5, 0.5) for transferring materials between chests and furnaces.\n- Wooden Chests at Positions (8.5, -0.5), (17.5, -0.5), (19.5, -0.5), (20.5, -0.5), and (8.5, 1.5) for storing materials.\n\n### Research Lab\n- Lab at Position (not specified) with input for automation science packs.\n\n### Electricity Network\n- Small Electric Poles at Positions (3.5, 20.5), (1.5, 6.5), (1.5, 10.5), (1.5, 2.5), and (1.5, 14.5) to distribute electricity.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Pipes\n- Ensure the target position for placing pipes is not already occupied by another entity. Remove any existing entities before attempting to place a pipe.\n\n### Steam Engine Not Working\n- Investigate the connections and ensure that the steam engine is properly connected to both the boiler and the offshore pump. Check for any missing or incorrectly placed pipes.\n\n### AttributeError in Code\n- When using the API, ensure that the correct attributes are being referenced. For example, use `PipeGroup` instead of `PipeToGround` if that is the intended attribute.\n\n### Errors when Using Extracting but Being Too Far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items."}
