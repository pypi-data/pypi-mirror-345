For example, crafting iron-gear-wheels requires iron-plates, which must be produced in a furnace.\n- If the furnace shows 'no ingredients to smelt', check that you have the necessary raw materials (like iron-ore) available to produce the required items.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
