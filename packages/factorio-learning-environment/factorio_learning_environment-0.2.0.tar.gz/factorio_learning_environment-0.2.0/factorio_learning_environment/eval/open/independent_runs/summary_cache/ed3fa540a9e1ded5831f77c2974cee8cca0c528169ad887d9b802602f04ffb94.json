{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Mining and Smelting Setup at (-21, -74)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (position -21.0, -73.0) mining copper ore\n- Iron chest (position -21.5, -74.5) storing copper ore\n- Burner inserter (position -20.5, -74.5) moving ore to furnace\n- Stone furnace (position -19.0, -74.0) smelting copper plates\n\n### Iron Mining and Smelting Setup at (-2, -76)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (position -2.0, -76.0) mining iron ore\n- Stone furnace (position -1.0, -74.0)\n- Burner inserter (position 0.5, -74.5)\n- Iron chest (position 1.5, -74.5) storing iron plates\n\n### Iron Processing Line at (3, -73)\nConsists of:\n- Two stone furnaces (positions 3.0, -73.0 and 5.0, -73.0)\n- Multiple burner inserters:\n  - At position 3.5, -74.5\n  - At position 5.5, -74.5\n  - At position 1.5, -72.5\n  - At position 6.5, -72.5\n- Storage chests:\n  - Iron chest (position 3.5, -75.5)\n  - Iron chest (position 0.5, -72.5)\n  - Iron chest (position 7.5, -72.5)\n  - Iron chest (position 3.5, -71.5)\n- Transport belt system connecting various parts:\n  - Belt group from (1.5, -74.5) to (1.5, -72.5)\n  - Belt group from (0.5, -70.5) to (7.5, -69.5)\n  - Belt group around (-0.5, -71.5) to (1.5, -71.5)\n  - Belt group from (0.5, -71.5) to (8.5, -74.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied spaces\n- Check if the target position is clear before placing new entities\n- The iron chest placement at (-1.5, -74.5) failed because another entity was already there\n\n### Resource management errors\n- Ensure required resources are available in inventory before attempting to insert them\n- The attempt to insert coal failed because there was no coal in inventory\n\n### Entity placement optimization\n- When placing multiple connected entities, plan the layout to ensure proper spacing and connections\n- Consider the working area of entities (miners, inserters) when planning placement to avoid blockages\n\n### Output handling\n- Ensure there are appropriate output collectors (chests, belts) for machines to prevent blocking\n- The burner mining drill at (-2.0, -76.0) is blocked because there's no proper output collection"}
