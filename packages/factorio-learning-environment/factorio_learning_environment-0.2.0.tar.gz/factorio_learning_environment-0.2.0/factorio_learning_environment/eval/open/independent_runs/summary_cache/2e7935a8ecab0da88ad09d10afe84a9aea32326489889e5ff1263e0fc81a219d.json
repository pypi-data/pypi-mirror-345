{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=27.5, y=-7.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (x=27.5, y=-7.5)\n- Boiler at Position (x=20.5, y=-4.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (x=4.5, y=-10.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting these entities for steam and water transport\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0) for smelting iron ore\n- Wooden Chest at Position (x=4.5, y=-0.5) for iron ore storage\n- Inserters for transferring materials between chests and furnaces\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=2.0, y=0.0) for smelting copper ore\n- Wooden Chest at Position (x=19.5, y=18.5) for copper ore storage\n- Inserters for transferring materials between chests and furnaces\n\n### Copper Cable Factory\nConsists of:\n- Assembling Machine at Position (x=10.5, y=0.5) for producing copper cables\n- Inserter at Position (x=3.5, y=0.5) for feeding copper plates into the assembling machine\n- BeltGroup connecting the furnace at Position (x=2.0, y=0.0) to the assembling machine at Position (x=10.5, y=0.5)\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Site\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (x=-11.0, y=20.0) extracting iron ore\n- Wooden Chest at Position (x=-11.5, y=18.5) for storing extracted iron ore\n\n### Copper Ore Mining Site\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (x=20.0, y=20.0) extracting copper ore\n- Wooden Chest at Position (x=19.5, y=18.5) for storing extracted copper ore\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Operations\n- Ensure there is a valid destination for inserters to place items. Avoid situations where inserters are blocked due to lack of space or missing destination entities.\n\n### Errors with Chest Management\n- Regularly check and empty chests to prevent them from becoming full, which can halt production processes.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Operations\n- Ensure furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Regularly supply furnaces with required ores to maintain continuous production."}
