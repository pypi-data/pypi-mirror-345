{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) \n  - Status: NO_FUEL\n  - Neighbours: Wooden Chest, Burner Inserter\n  - Resources: Iron Ore (10,000 units)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Inventory: Iron Ore (691 units)\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Status: WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS\n  - Neighbours: Wooden Chest, Burner Mining Drill\n  - Pickup Position: (x=-12.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Drop Position: (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\n  - Status: NO_INGREDIENTS\n  - Furnace Result: Iron Plate (2 units)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Alignment Errors\n- Ensure the inserter's pickup position aligns with the chest's position to facilitate the transfer of iron ore. Misalignment results in the inserter not functioning correctly. \n\n### Fuel Management Errors\n- Regularly check and refuel mining drills and inserters to prevent them from running out of fuel, which halts operations. Consider mining more coal or redistributing existing coal efficiently.\n\n### Inventory Management Errors\n- Avoid attempting to insert items into entities when the required items are not present in the inventory. Ensure you have the necessary resources before executing such actions."}
