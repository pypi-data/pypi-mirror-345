{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-14.0, -49.0) and (-16.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-14.0, -49.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal\n  - Source: Iron Ore\n  - Result: Iron Plate\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-16.0, -49.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal\n  - Source: Iron Ore\n  - Result: Iron Plate\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -47.5)\n  - Fuel: Coal\n  - Transfers iron plates from the furnace at (-14.0, -49.0) to the wooden chest\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-13.5, -46.5)\n  - Stores iron plates transferred by the burner inserter\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure the target tile is unoccupied and suitable for the entity type before attempting placement. This will prevent placement errors such as those encountered with stone furnaces and iron chests.\n\n### Errors related to crafting without appropriate setup\n- Iron plates cannot be crafted directly in the inventory; they require a crafting machine or smelting in a furnace. Ensure you have the correct setup before attempting to craft items that require specific machinery.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient inventory items\n- Before attempting to insert items into entities, verify that you have the necessary items in your inventory to avoid insertion errors, such as the one encountered when trying to insert iron ore into a furnace without having any in the inventory.\n\n### Validation errors during entity operations\n- Ensure that all parameters, such as dimensions or positions, are valid integers and correctly specified to avoid validation errors during operations like building or modifying entities."}
