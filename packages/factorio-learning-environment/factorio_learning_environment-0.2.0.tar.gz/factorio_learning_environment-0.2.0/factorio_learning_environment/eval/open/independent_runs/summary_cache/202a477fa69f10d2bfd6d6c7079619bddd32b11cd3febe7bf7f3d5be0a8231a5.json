{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0)\n- Wooden Chests at positions (52.5, -84.5) and (54.5, -84.5) storing coal\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-23.0, -68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0)\n- Wooden Chests at positions (-23.5, -69.5) and (-24.5, -67.5) storing copper ore\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -70.0) with no ingredients\n- Stone Furnace at position (-21.0, -62.0) with no ingredients\n- Burner Inserters at positions (-16.5, -69.5), (-15.5, -64.5), and (-19.5, -61.5) waiting for source items\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0)\n- Wooden Chests at positions (-14.5, -54.5) and (-12.5, -54.5) storing iron ore\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5) with output blocked\n\n### Copper Ore Storage\nConsists of multiple wooden chests storing copper ore at various positions:\n- Positions include (0.5, -4.5), (5.5, -4.5), (0.5, -2.5), (0.5, -3.5), (5.5, -2.5), (5.5, -3.5), (0.5, 2.5), (0.5, 3.5), (5.5, 2.5), (5.5, 3.5), (0.5, 4.5), (5.5, 4.5), (6.5, 0.5), (7.5, 0.5), (9.5, 0.5), (8.5, 0.5), (-4.5, 0.5), (-2.5, 0.5), (-3.5, 0.5)\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnaces at positions (0.0, 0.0) and (5.0, 0.0) with no ingredients\n- Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5) storing copper ore and iron plate\n- Burner Inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) waiting for source items\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the inserters are correctly connected to a source entity that can supply the required items. Check the connections and ensure that the source entities have the necessary items available for transfer.\n\n### Errors with Furnaces Having No Ingredients\n- Verify that the input connections to the furnaces are correctly established and that the necessary ingredients are being supplied to the furnaces for processing.\n\n### Errors with Destination Chests Being Full\n- Regularly check the inventory levels of destination chests and extract items as needed to prevent overflow and ensure continuous operation of inserters and other entities.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Output Blocked\n- Ensure that there is a clear path for inserters to place items into the destination entity. Remove any items blocking the output path or provide additional storage capacity."}
