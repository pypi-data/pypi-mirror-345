{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-46.5, -122.0)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (-59.5, -111.5)\n- Boiler at position (-46.5, -122.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-68.5, -95.5)\n- Pipe connections from offshore pump to boiler and steam engine, including positions such as (-68.5, -94.5) and (-59.5, -114.5)\n- Small electric poles at positions like (-61.5, -110.5) and (-57.5, -111.5) for power distribution\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -76.0) connected to an Iron Chest at position (-15.5, -77.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -73.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (9.0, -64.0) for smelting copper ore into copper plates\n- Stone Furnace at position (6.0, -62.0) for additional smelting capacity\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) for moving items between entities\n- Wooden Chest at position (7.5, -61.5) for storage\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- Multiple pipe groups for fluid transport, including water and steam, with key positions such as (-42.5, -124.5) and (-50.5, -122.5)\n\n### Electricity Distribution Network\n- Small electric poles forming a network, with key positions such as (-6.5, -87.5) and (0.5, -60.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors When Placing Entities Too Far\n- Ensure you are within the maximum placement distance (10 units) from the target position before attempting to place an entity. Move closer to the target position to avoid placement errors.\n\n### Errors with Fuel Management\n- Regularly check and refuel entities like boilers and burner mining drills to prevent them from running out of fuel and halting production.\n\n### Errors with Full Inventory\n- Ensure that chests connected to mining drills are regularly emptied to prevent them from becoming full and stopping the mining process.\n\n### Errors with Ingredient Supply\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt, as lack of ingredients will halt production."}
