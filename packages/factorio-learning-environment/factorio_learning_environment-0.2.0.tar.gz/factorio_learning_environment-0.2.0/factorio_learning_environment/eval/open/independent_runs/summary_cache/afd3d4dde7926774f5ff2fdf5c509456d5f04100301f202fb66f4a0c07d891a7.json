Double-check the inserter's pickup and drop positions.\n\n### Errors with Fuel Management\n- Maintain an adequate supply of coal in your inventory to refuel mining drills and inserters. Regularly check your inventory to ensure you have enough coal for refueling tasks.\n\n### Errors in Resource Availability\n- Verify that the furnace has the necessary ingredients (iron ore) to smelt. Ensure that the inserter is functioning correctly to transfer iron ore from the chest to the furnace."}
