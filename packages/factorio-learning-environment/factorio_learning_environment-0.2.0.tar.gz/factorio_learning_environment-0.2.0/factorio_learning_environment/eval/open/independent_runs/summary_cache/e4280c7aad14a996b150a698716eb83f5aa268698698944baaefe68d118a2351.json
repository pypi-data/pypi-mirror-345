{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Extraction and Processing at Position (40.5, -83.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest at position (40.5, -83.5) for coal storage.\n- Burner mining drill at position (41.0, -82.0) for extracting coal, connected to the wooden chest.\n- Transport belt group connecting the burner mining drill to the wooden chest.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner inserter at position (1.5, 0.5) for inserting iron ore into the furnace.\n- Wooden chest at position (2.5, 0.5) for storing iron plates.\n- Transport belt group and burner inserters facilitating movement of materials between entities.\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility at Position (10.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace at position (10.0, 0.0) for smelting copper ore into copper plates.\n- Burner inserter at position (11.5, 0.5) for inserting copper ore into the furnace.\n- Wooden chest at position (12.5, 0.5) for storing copper plates.\n- Transport belt group and burner inserters facilitating movement of materials between entities.\n\n### Intermediate Storage and Transport System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chests at positions (7.5, 0.5) and (2.5, 0.5) for intermediate storage.\n- Burner inserters and transport belts connecting various chests and furnaces for efficient material flow.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserters and Missing Entities\n- Ensure that the target entity exists at the specified position before attempting to use an inserter. Verify the presence of entities at positions like (0.5, 0.5), (5.5, 0.5), and (10.5, 0.5) before executing inserter actions.\n\n### Errors When Placing into a Tile Occupied by Another Entity\n- Before placing a new entity, check if the tile is already occupied by another object. This will prevent placement errors such as those encountered at positions (0.5, 0.5), (5.5, 0.5), and (10.5, 0.5).\n\n### Handling Full Chests and Blockages\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are full to prevent blockages and ensure continuous operation of mining drills and inserters. This will avoid warnings like \"chest at drop position is full.\"\n\n### Refueling and Maintenance of Entities\n- Ensure that all burner entities, such as mining drills and inserters, are adequately refueled to maintain their operation and prevent stoppages due to lack of fuel."}
