{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-16.0, -51.0) with coal as fuel, currently working but output is blocked due to no sink entity.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) with coal as fuel, currently not producing due to lack of ingredients.\n\n### Storage Facility\n- Wooden Chest at position (-22.5, -51.5), currently empty.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied locations\n- Ensure the target tile is free before attempting to place an entity. This will prevent errors such as \"Cannot place Wooden Chest at the desired location\" and \"Cannot place Burner Inserter at the desired location.\"\n\n### Errors due to lack of inventory items\n- Verify that the required items are available in the inventory before attempting to place entities. This will avoid errors like \"Could not place burner-mining-drill at (-21.0, -52.0), No burner_mining_drill in inventory.\"\n\n### Errors when using transport belts\n- Confirm the placement area is clear and suitable for transport belts to avoid errors such as \"Cannot place Transport Belt at the desired location.\"\n\n### Errors in production setup\n- Regularly check the setup of production facilities to ensure all necessary ingredients and outputs are correctly configured. This will help avoid issues like \"The furnace is not producing iron plates. Check the setup.\"\n\n### Output Blockage Warnings\n- Address warnings such as \"output blocked by item on the ground\" by ensuring there is a connected sink entity to accept the output from production facilities."}
