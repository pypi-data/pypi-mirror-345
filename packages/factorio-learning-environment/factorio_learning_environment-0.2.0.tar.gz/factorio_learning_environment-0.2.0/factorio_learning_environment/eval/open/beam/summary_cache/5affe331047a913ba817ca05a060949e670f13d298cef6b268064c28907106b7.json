Continue monitoring the production of iron plates.\n2. Consider crafting additional entities or expanding our factory layout based on the output.\n3. Gather more iron ore if needed to keep both furnaces running efficiently.\n\nLet's wait a bit longer to allow the furnaces to process the iron ore and check our inventory again.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Wait for a few seconds to allow the furnaces to process the iron ore\nsleep(10)  # Adjust the time as necessary to ensure production\n\n# Check the inventory and entity status after waiting\nprint(f\"Inventory after waiting for production: {inspect_inventory()}\")\nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")", "summary_range": "[1-40]"}
