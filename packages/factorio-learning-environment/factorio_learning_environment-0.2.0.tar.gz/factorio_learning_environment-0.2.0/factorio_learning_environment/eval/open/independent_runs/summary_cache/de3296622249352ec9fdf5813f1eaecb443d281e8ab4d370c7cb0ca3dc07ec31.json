{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-18.5, 17.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position not specified), boiler (position -18.5, 17.5), and offshore pump (position not specified).\n\n### Lab at position(-17.5, 23.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab (position -17.5, 23.5)\n\n### Assembling machine at position(-21.5, 25.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine (position -21.5, 25.5)\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(x)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position x1) and a furnace at position(y1)\n- Burner mining drill (position x2) and a furnace at position(y2)\n- Burner mining drill (position x3) and a furnace at position(y3)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when removing entities\n- Ensure the second argument for the remove function is a valid Position object. Review the coordinates being passed to the function.\n\n### Errors when adding fuel to boiler\n- Make sure there is a nearby entity that can accept coal before attempting to add fuel to the boiler.\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities\n- Verify that the entity exists at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it. Check the coordinates and ensure the entity type matches.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it. Check for existing entities in the target position."}
