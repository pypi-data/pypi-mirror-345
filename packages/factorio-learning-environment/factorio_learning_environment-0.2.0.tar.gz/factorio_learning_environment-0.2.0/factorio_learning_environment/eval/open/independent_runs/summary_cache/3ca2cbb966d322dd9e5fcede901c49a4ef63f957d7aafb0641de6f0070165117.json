{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Fuel: 1 unit of coal\n  - Neighbours: \n    - Wooden Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n    - Burner Inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Warnings: Chest at drop position is full. Empty the chest at (-14.5, -48.5) to continue mining.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Contains: 5 units of iron ore\n  - Status: Normal\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Warnings: Out of fuel\n  - Neighbours:\n    - Wooden Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n    - Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n    - Stone Furnace at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0)\n  - Fuel: 6 units of coal\n  - Status: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Inserter Setup\n- Ensure the inserter is properly aligned and positioned to transfer items from the chest to the furnace. Reposition and align the inserter if necessary.\n\n### Errors with Fuel Management\n- Regularly check and refuel entities like the mining drill and inserter to prevent them from running out of fuel and halting operations.\n\n### Errors with Chest Management\n- Monitor the chest inventory to prevent it from becoming full, which can halt mining operations. Regularly extract items from the chest to free up space.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Operations\n- Ensure the furnace is receiving the necessary ingredients to operate. Check the inserter setup and ensure it is correctly transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace."}
