{"content": "Ah, I see the core issue now - we don't have any iron ore in our inventory! Let's analyze what we have and what we need:\n\n```python\n# First check our inventory\nprint(f\"Current inventory: {inspect_inventory()}\")\n\n# Find all entities in our area\nentities = get_entities()\nprint(f\"Nearby entities: {entities}\")\n\n# Look specifically for mining drills\ndrills = get_entities({Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill})\nprint(f\"Mining drills found: {drills}\")\n\n# Check what the drill is mining (if anything)\nfor drill in drills:\n    print(f\"Drill at {drill.position}:\")\n    print(f\"- Status: {drill.status}\")\n    print(f\"- Mining target: {drill.mining_target if hasattr(drill, 'mining_target') else 'None'}\")\n    print(f\"- Drop position: {drill.drop_position}\")\n```\n\nThis will help us understand:\n1. What resources we currently have\n2. What entities are available\n3. If the drill is actually mining iron ore\n4. Where the ore is being dropped\n\nThen we can determine our next steps based on this information.", "summary_range": "[1-3408]"}
