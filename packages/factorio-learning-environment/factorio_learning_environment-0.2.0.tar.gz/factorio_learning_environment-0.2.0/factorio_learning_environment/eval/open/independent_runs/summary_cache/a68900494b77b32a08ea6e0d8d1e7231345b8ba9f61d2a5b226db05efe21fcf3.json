{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position(-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position -15.0, -50.0) with coal as fuel, currently working and extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden chest (position -14.5, -48.5) storing iron ore (currently holding 214 iron ore).\n- Stone furnace (position 0.0, 0.0) which currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n- **Errors inserting iron ore**: \n  - Ensure that you have iron ore in your inventory before attempting to insert it into the furnace or chest. The current inventory shows only wood.\n  \n- **Furnace status after insertion**: \n  - The furnace reports \"NO_INGREDIENTS\" because it is not receiving any iron ore. Make sure to transfer iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n\n- **Warnings from Burner Mining Drill**: \n  - The warning indicates that the chest at the drop position is full. Empty the chest at (-14.5, -48.5) to continue mining.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- **Utility Functions**: \n  - None defined yet.\n\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `current_inventory`: dict (e.g., {'wood': 6})\n  - `chest_inventory`: dict (e.g., {'iron-ore': 214})\n  - `furnace_status`: EntityStatus (e.g., EntityStatus.NO_INGREDIENTS)\n  - `nearest_coal_position`: tuple (e.g., (40.5, -82.5))"}
