{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### First furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position 0.0, 0.0) with a fuel inventory containing coal and a source inventory containing iron ore. It produces iron plates.\n\n### Second furnace at position (2.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position 2.0, 0.0) with a fuel inventory containing coal. It is currently not smelting due to no ingredients.\n\n### Third furnace at position (4.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position 4.0, 0.0) with a fuel inventory containing coal. It is currently not smelting due to no ingredients and the fuel source being full.\n\n### Fourth furnace at position (6.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position 6.0, 0.0) with a fuel inventory containing coal. It is currently not smelting due to no ingredients.\n\n### Wooden chest at position (8.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest (position 8.5, 0.5) with an empty inventory.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position (x)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position x1) and a furnace at position (y1)\n- Burner mining drill (position x2) and a furnace at position (y2)\n- Burner mining drill (position x3) and a furnace at position (y3)\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position x1) and a furnace at position (y1)\n- Assembling machine at position (z1) and inserter at position (a) that puts into the assembling machine\n- Beltgroup (position) that connects the furnace at position y1 to the assembling machine at position (z1)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to inventory management\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into a furnace. Common errors include trying to insert iron ore or coal when the inventory is empty or full.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors related to furnace ingredient management\n- Monitor the ingredient levels in your furnaces and ensure they have enough materials to operate. If a furnace is reporting \"no ingredients to smelt,\" check the inventories and refill as necessary."}
