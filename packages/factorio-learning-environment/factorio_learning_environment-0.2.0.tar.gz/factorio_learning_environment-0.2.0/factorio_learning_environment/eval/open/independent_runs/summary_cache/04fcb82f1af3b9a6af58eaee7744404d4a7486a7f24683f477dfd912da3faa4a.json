{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) connected to a **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) and another **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-15.5, y=-48.5).\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) transferring items from the **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) to a **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0).\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-8.5, y=-47.5) transferring items from the **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-10.0, y=-48.0) to a **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-7.5, y=-47.5).\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-6.5, y=-48.5) storing iron plates.\n\n### Iron Ore Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-11.5, y=-45.5) waiting for source items, intended to transfer iron ore to a furnace.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors due to undefined entities\n- Ensure that all entities are correctly defined and available at the specified positions before attempting operations on them. For example, the error \"name 'Chest' is not defined\" suggests that the entity was not correctly initialized or is missing.\n\n### Errors due to full inventory\n- Regularly check the inventory status of entities like furnaces and chests to ensure they have space available for new items. For instance, attempting to insert items into a full furnace will result in an error.\n\n### Errors due to inserters waiting for source items\n- Ensure that the source entities for inserters have the necessary items available for transfer to avoid idle inserters."}
