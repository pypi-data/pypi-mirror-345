{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Production at Position (-20.0, -70.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -70.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-18.0, -70.0)\n- Burner Inserter at position (-20.5, -66.5) connected to a Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -65.0) and a Transport Belt network.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Transport at Position (-23.0, -68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) connected to a Transport Belt network and a Wooden Chest at position (-23.5, -69.5).\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -54.5) and a Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Production and Storage at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Burner Inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) connected to Wooden Chests at positions (1.5, 0.5) and (3.5, 0.5).\n\n### Transport Belt Network\nConsists of multiple Belt Groups connecting various entities across the map:\n- BeltGroup connecting positions from (-25.5, -70.5) to (-23.5, -70.5) and from (-21.5, -67.5) to (-21.5, -69.5).\n- BeltGroup connecting positions from (-18.5, -71.5) to (-16.5, -71.5).\n- BeltGroup connecting positions from (-26.5, -68.5) to (-24.5, -68.5).\n- Additional BeltGroups connecting various positions for resource transport.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Connecting Transport Belts\n- Ensure that the path for connecting transport belts is valid and continuous. Avoid gaps in belt placement to ensure smooth resource flow.\n\n### Errors with Belt Placement\n- Verify that the destination position for belt placement is not obstructed or invalid. Check the path length and ensure it is within permissible limits."}
