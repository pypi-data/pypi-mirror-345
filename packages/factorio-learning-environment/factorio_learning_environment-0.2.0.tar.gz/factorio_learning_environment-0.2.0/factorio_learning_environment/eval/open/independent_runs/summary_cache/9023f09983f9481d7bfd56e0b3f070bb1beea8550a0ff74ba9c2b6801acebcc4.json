{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-7.0, 23.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (-3.5, 23.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-7.0, 23.5)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe Group connecting the offshore pump to the boiler\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Furnace 1 at Position (-14.0, -49.0)\n- Furnace 2 at Position (-12.0, -48.0)\n- Multiple Burner Inserters supplying coal and iron ore to the furnaces\n- Wooden Chest at Position (-13.5, -46.5) storing iron plates\n- Iron Chest at Position (-11.5, -44.5) storing iron plates\n- Belt Group transporting materials between furnaces and chests\n\n### Transport Belt Network\nConsists of:\n- Belts connecting various positions for material transport, including:\n  - Belt from (x=-11.5, y=-46.5) to (x=-9.5, y=-46.5)\n  - Belt from (x=-8.5, y=-45.5) to (x=-8.5, y=-43.5)\n  - Belt from (x=-16.5, y=-49.5) to (x=-16.5, y=-47.5)\n  - Belt from (x=-14.5, y=-45.5) to (x=-14.5, y=-47.5)\n  - Belt from (x=-13.5, y=-46.5) to (x=-11.5, y=-46.5)\n  - Belt from (x=-14.5, y=-45.5) to (x=-14.5, y=-43.5)\n  - Belt from (x=-13.5, y=-45.5) to (x=-11.5, y=-45.5)\n\n### Research Lab\n- Lab with no research in progress\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors When Using Inserters\n- Ensure that inserters have a clear path to both source and destination entities. Avoid placing items on the ground where they can block inserter operations.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Source Items\n- Make sure that the inserters have access to the necessary source items to function properly. Regularly check and replenish the source items for inserters.\n\n### Errors When Inserting Items Without Inventory\n- Verify that the required items are available in your inventory before attempting to insert them into a furnace or any other entity."}
