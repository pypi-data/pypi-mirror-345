{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Plant at position (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, -0.5)\n- Boiler at (-6.5, 0.0) connected to offshore pump via pipes\n- Steam engine at (-2.5, 0.5) connected to boiler via pipes\n- Power network (id=818) connecting to all mining drills\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility at position (15.5, 70.5)\nConsists of:\n- 5 Electric mining drills at:\n  - (15.5, 70.5) connected to wooden chest at (15.5, 72.5)\n  - (18.5, 70.5)\n  - (21.5, 70.5)\n  - (24.5, 70.5)\n  - (27.5, 70.5)\n- 5 Iron smelting furnaces at:\n  - (16.0, 68.0)\n  - (19.0, 68.0)\n  - (22.0, 68.0)\n  - (25.0, 68.0)\n  - (28.0, 68.0)\n- 5 Steel smelting furnaces at:\n  - (16.0, 65.0)\n  - (19.0, 65.0)\n  - (22.0, 65.0)\n  - (25.0, 65.0)\n  - (28.0, 65.0)\n- 5 Burner inserters between iron and steel furnaces at:\n  - (16.5, 66.5)\n  - (19.5, 66.5)\n  - (22.5, 66.5)\n  - (25.5, 66.5)\n  - (28.5, 66.5)\n\n### New Offshore Pump at (-9.5, -2.5)\n- Currently not connected to any boilers\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Belt connection errors\n- Transport belts cannot be connected directly to chests - use inserters as intermediaries\n- When connecting belts between entities, ensure the target entity can accept direct belt input (most buildings require inserters)\n\n### Placement errors\n- Check for existing entities before placing new ones, especially when:\n  - Placing inserters between existing structures (multiple failed attempts at (15.5, 71.5))\n  - Placing power poles near other entities (had to remove interfering poles at x=16.0-28.0 y=66.5)\n  - Placing pipes between existing structures (failed at (-7.5, -0.5))\n- When using place_entity_next_to(), adjust spacing or direction if placement fails due to existing objects\n\n### Fluid connection issues\n- Ensure proper alignment when connecting fluid entities:\n  - Offshore pump outputs must face the boiler input\n  - Check connection points aren't blocked by other entities\n  - Verify fluid types match between connected entities\n\n### Fuel management errors\n- Ensure you have sufficient coal in inventory before attempting to fuel furnaces\n- Don't overfill furnace fuel slots (50 coal is maximum)\n- Monitor furnace status for \"no ingredients\" and \"no fuel\" warnings\n\n### Mining drill output issues\n- Most mining drills are waiting for space (output blocked) - need to:\n  - Connect output to furnaces via belts/inserters\n  - Or provide chests to collect output\n- First drill at (15.5,70.5) has chest connection but no inserter\n\n### Power issues\n- Electric mining drills show \"not receiving electricity\" warnings\n- Verify power pole connections and power production capacity"}
