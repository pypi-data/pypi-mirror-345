{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (x=53.0, y=-83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=53.0, y=-83.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=52.5, y=-84.5) for coal extraction and storage.\n\n### Copper Plate Production Line at Position (x=-25.0, y=-64.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-25.0, y=-64.0) extracting copper ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-23.0, y=-66.0) for smelting copper ore.\n- BeltGroup connecting the Burner Mining Drill to the Stone Furnace, with belts at positions (x=-26.5, y=-65.5) to (x=-24.5, y=-65.5) and (x=-25.5, y=-65.5) to (x=-23.5, y=-65.5).\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage Facility at Position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-54.5) for iron ore extraction and storage.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using connect_entities function\n- Ensure that all entities involved in the connection have valid positions and are not None. Check that the entities exist and are correctly referenced before attempting to connect them.\n\n### Errors due to non-functional Belt Groups\n- Verify that all belts in a Belt Group are correctly aligned and connected to ensure proper item flow. Reconnect or adjust belts if necessary to restore functionality.\n\n### Errors when entities are out of fuel\n- Regularly check the fuel levels of Burner Mining Drills and Furnaces. Ensure they are refueled promptly to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Errors due to missing ingredients in Furnaces\n- Ensure that the required ingredients for smelting are available in the Furnace inventory to avoid production halts."}
