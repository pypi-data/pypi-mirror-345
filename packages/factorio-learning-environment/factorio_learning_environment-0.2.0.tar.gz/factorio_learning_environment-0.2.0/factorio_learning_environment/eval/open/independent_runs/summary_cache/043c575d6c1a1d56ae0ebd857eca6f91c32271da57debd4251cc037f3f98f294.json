For example, the `PipeGroup` object does not have a `fluid_system` attribute. Verify the object structure in the documentation before accessing attributes.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors related to power connections\n- Check that all power-consuming entities are properly connected to a power network to avoid issues like \"no power\"."}
