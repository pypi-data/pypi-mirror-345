{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-15.0, -49.0)\n  - Status: Working, but output is full.\n  - Fuel: 9 units of coal.\n  - Source Inventory: 41 units of iron ore.\n  - Result Inventory: 100 iron plates.\n\n### Coal Mining and Transport System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (42.0, -83.0)\n  - Fuel: 1 unit of coal.\n  - Status: Working, but output is blocked.\n  - Neighbours: Transport belt at position (43.5, -82.5) and burner inserter at position (42.5, -81.5).\n  - Resources: 40,000 units of coal available.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (42.5, -81.5)\n  - Fuel: 50 units of coal.\n  - Status: Waiting for source items.\n  - Neighbours: Burner mining drill at position (42.0, -83.0) and transport belts at positions (43.5, -82.5) and (43.5, -80.5).\n  - Pickup Position: (41.5, -81.5)\n  - Drop Position: (43.5, -81.5)\n- **BeltGroup** connecting positions (42.5, -82.5) to (42.5, -79.5)\n  - Inputs: Belts from (42.5, -82.5) to (44.5, -82.5) and (43.5, -81.5) to (43.5, -79.5).\n  - Outputs: Belt from (43.5, -80.5) to (42.5, -79.5).\n  - Status: Empty, consisting of 7 belts.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Transport Belts\n- Ensure the intended position for placing transport belts is not obstructed by other entities or terrain. Clear any obstructions before attempting to place belts.\n\n### Errors when Placing Wooden Chests\n- Verify that the intended position for placing wooden chests is clear of other entities or terrain obstructions. Clear any obstructions before attempting to place chests.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Placement\n- Ensure that the intended position for placing inserters is not occupied by another entity. Check for obstructions and clear them before placing inserters.\n\n### Errors with Transport Belt Connections\n- Verify that transport belts are correctly aligned and connected. Ensure that the starting and ending positions of the belts are clear and that there are no gaps in the belt network.\n\n### Handling Full Output Warnings\n- Regularly check and clear the output of entities like furnaces and drills to prevent them from becoming full and halting production. Ensure there are appropriate sink entities to accept outputs.\n\n### Alternative Collection Methods\n- If standard methods of collection are not feasible due to obstructions or full inventories, explore alternative methods to manage resources effectively."}
