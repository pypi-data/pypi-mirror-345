{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll create a comprehensive report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Complex at (-15.0, -50.0)\n- Burner mining drill mining iron ore\n- Output wooden chest at (-13.5, -50.5) storing mined ore\n- Burner inserter at (-14.5, -51.5) moving ore from drill to chest\n- Burner inserter at (-12.5, -50.5) moving ore from chest to belt system\n- Complex belt network for ore transportation\n- Mining drill is operational with coal fuel level of 32\n\n### Coal Mining Station at (38.0, -83.0)\n- Burner mining drill (currently out of fuel)\n- Storage chest at (39.5, -83.5) containing 496 coal\n- Connected to main resource distribution system\n\n### Smelting Complex around (46.0, -80.0) and (51.0, -80.0)\n- Two stone furnaces at (46.0, -80.0) and (51.0, -80.0)\n- Multiple burner inserters in coordinated arrangement for material handling\n- Both furnaces have 50 coal as fuel but currently idle due to no ingredients\n- Storage chest at (49.5, -79.5) containing 1470 iron plates and 50 coal\n\n### Storage System at (41.5, -86.5)\n- Multiple wooden chests for storage\n- Main storage chest contains 773 iron ore\n- Burner inserter at (40.5, -86.5) for automated item movement\n- Additional empty storage chest at (43.5, -86.5)\n\n### Belt Transportation Network\nMultiple belt groups connecting various structures:\n- Main line with 56 belts connecting (30.5, -65.5) to (51.5, -83.5)\n- Secondary lines with 21, 15, and 6 belts for ore distribution\n- Several smaller belt groups (2-8 belts) for local transport\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n1. Inventory Management Issues\n- Clear inventory before attempting to pick up or remove structures\n- Implement better inventory management when storage chests are full\n- Consider creating more storage space when chest capacity is reached (773/800)\n\n2. Entity Placement Conflicts\n- Always check and clear existing entities before placing new ones\n- Verify target positions are empty before attempting to place belts or other structures\n\n3. Belt System Issues\n- Clear blocked belts before attempting repairs or modifications\n- Ensure proper connection and flow between belt segments\n- Monitor belt capacity and throughput to prevent blockages\n\n4. Resource Management\n- Monitor fuel levels in mining drills to prevent operation interruption\n- Maintain adequate coal distribution to all burner entities\n- Balance storage capacity with production rate\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nImportant Variables:\n- EntityStatus: Enum type for entity states (WORKING, WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION, NO_FUEL, etc.)\n- Direction: Enum type for entity orientation (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT)\n- Position: Class for coordinate handling (x, y)\n- Inventory: Class for item storage management\n\nUtility Functions:\n- None explicitly defined in the provided logs"}
