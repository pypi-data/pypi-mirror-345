{"content": "I understand the error now. The furnace doesn't exist at the specified position because we haven't placed it yet. Let me modify the code to first place the furnace and then set it up:\n\n```python\n# Check our inventory first\ninventory = inspect_inventory()\nprint(f\"Current inventory: {inventory}\")\n\n# Move to the mining drill and fuel it\nmove_to(Position(x=-15.0, y=23.0))\ndrill = get_entity(Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill, Position(x=-15.0, y=23.0))\nif drill:\n    insert_item(Prototype.Coal, drill, quantity=5)\n    print(f\"Added fuel to mining drill at {drill.position}\")\n\n# Move to where we want to place the furnace\nmove_to(Position(x=-10.0, y=29.0))\n\n# Place the furnace first\nfurnace = place_entity(\n    Prototype.StoneFurnace,\n    position=Position(x=-10.0, y=29.0),\n    direction=Direction.NORTH\n)\n\nif furnace:\n    print(f\"Placed furnace at {furnace.position}\")\n    # Add fuel to the furnace\n    insert_item(Prototype.Coal, furnace, quantity=5)\n    print(\"Added fuel to furnace\")\n\n    # Add input transport belt\n    belt = place_entity(\n        Prototype.TransportBelt,\n        position=Position(x=-10.0, y=28.0),\n        direction=Direction.EAST\n    )\n    if belt:\n        print(f\"Added transport belt at {belt.position}\")\n\n    # Add input inserter\n    input_inserter = place_entity(\n        Prototype.BurnerInserter,\n        position=Position(x=-11.0, y=29.0),\n        direction=Direction.RIGHT\n    )\n    if input_inserter:\n        print(f\"Added input inserter at {input_inserter.position}\")\n        insert_item(Prototype.Coal, input_inserter, quantity=5)\n        print(\"Added fuel to input inserter\")\n\n# Verify our setup\nprint(f\"Final inventory: {inspect_inventory()}\")\nentities = get_entities()\nprint(f\"Current entities: {entities}\")\n\n# Verify the furnace was created and is working\nfurnace = get_entity(Prototype.StoneFurnace, Position(x=-10.0, y=29.0))\nif furnace:\n    print(f\"Furnace status: {furnace.status}\")\n```\n\nKey changes made:\n1. Added inventory check at the start\n2. Place the furnace first before trying to interact with it\n3. Added proper error handling with if statements\n4. Simplified the setup to focus on getting the basic furnace working first\n5. Added verification steps to confirm the setup\n\nTips for future interactions:\n1. Always check inventory before placing items\n2. Use proper error handling with if statements\n3. Place entities before trying to interact with them\n4. Verify entity placement after each step\n5. Use proper directions (NORTH, EAST, etc.) for entity placement\n6. Keep track of entity positions for future reference\n\nLet me know if you need any clarification or if you'd like to proceed with adding more components to the setup!", "summary_range": "[1-802]"}
