{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) for extracting iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-15.5, -51.5) to transfer resources from the mining drill to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-10.0, -50.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -52.5) to transfer resources from the transport belt to the wooden chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -52.5) for storing finished products.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Ensure there is no existing object in the target location before placing a new entity. Check the area for any obstructions and clear them if necessary.\n\n### Misalignment between mining drill and inserter\n- Regularly check the alignment of mining drills and inserters to ensure efficient resource transfer. Adjust positions as needed to maintain proper operation.\n\n### Output blocked by items on the ground\n- Clear any items blocking the output of mining drills or inserters to ensure continuous operation. Ensure there is a sink entity in place to accept the output.\n\n### No ingredients to smelt in the furnace\n- Ensure that the furnace has the necessary ingredients to smelt by monitoring inventory levels and refilling as needed."}
