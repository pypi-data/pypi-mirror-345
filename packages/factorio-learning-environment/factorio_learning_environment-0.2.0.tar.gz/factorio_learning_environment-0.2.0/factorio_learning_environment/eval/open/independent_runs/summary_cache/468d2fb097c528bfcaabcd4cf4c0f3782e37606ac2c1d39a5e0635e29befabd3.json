{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnace at position (61.0, -54.0)**\n  - Status: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Inventory: Iron plates\n- **Furnace at position (64.0, -53.0)**\n  - Status: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Inventory: Iron plates\n- **Burner Inserter at position (62.5, -53.5)**\n  - Status: Waiting for source items\n  - Connects to the furnace at (61.0, -54.0)\n- **Burner Inserter at position (65.5, -52.5)**\n  - Status: Waiting for source items\n  - Connects to the furnace at (64.0, -53.0)\n- **Wooden Chest at position (61.5, -52.5)**\n  - Inventory: Stone brick, wood, coal, stone\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0)**\n  - Status: Out of fuel\n  - Neighbors: Wooden chests and burner inserter\n- **Burner Inserter at position (41.5, -83.5)**\n  - Status: Working\n  - Connects to the wooden chest at (40.5, -83.5)\n- **Wooden Chests at positions (40.5, -83.5), (42.5, -83.5), (43.5, -83.5), (44.5, -83.5)**\n  - Inventory: Coal\n\n### Belt Systems\n- **Belt Group 1**\n  - Inputs: Belt at (43.5, -82.5)\n  - Outputs: Belt at (67.5, -52.5)\n  - Status: Empty\n  - Consists of 55 belts\n- **Belt Group 2**\n  - Inputs: Belts at (43.5, -80.5) and (44.5, -81.5)\n  - Outputs: Belts at (63.5, -50.5) and (64.5, -50.5)\n  - Status: Empty\n  - Consists of 107 belts\n- **Belt Group 3**\n  - Inputs: Belt at (42.5, -81.5)\n  - Outputs: Belt at (65.5, -48.5)\n  - Status: Empty\n  - Consists of 69 belts\n- **Belt Group 4**\n  - Inputs: Belt at (67.5, -49.5)\n  - Outputs: Belt at (66.5, -49.5)\n  - Status: Empty\n  - Consists of 2 belts\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting belts\n- Ensure that the path between the starting and ending points of a belt connection is valid and unobstructed.\n- Verify that the belts are aligned correctly and that there are no obstacles blocking the path.\n\n### Errors due to misplaced belts\n- Before placing belts, clear any existing belts that may obstruct the new path.\n- Check the alignment and direction of belts to ensure they connect properly.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- **connect_entities**: Attempts to connect two entities using a specified prototype (e.g., TransportBelt). \n  - Failure Mode: Returns an error when the path is not valid or cannot be normalized.\n  - Success Mode: Successfully connects entities when the path is clear and valid.\n\n### Important Variables\n- **belt_start_position**: Position of the starting point for belt connections. Type: Position\n- **belt_path_to_inserter_1.center**: Target position for connecting belts to inserter 1. Type: Position\n- **belt_path_to_inserter_2.center**: Target position for connecting belts to inserter 2. Type: Position"}
