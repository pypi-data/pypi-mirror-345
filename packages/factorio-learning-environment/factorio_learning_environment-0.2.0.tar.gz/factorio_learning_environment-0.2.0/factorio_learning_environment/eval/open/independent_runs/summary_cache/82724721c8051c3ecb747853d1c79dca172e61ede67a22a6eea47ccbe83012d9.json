{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Setup at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and deposits into the wooden chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the stone furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities Too Far\n- Ensure you are within the maximum placement distance (10 units) from the target position when placing entities. Move closer to the target position before attempting to place an entity.\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities in Occupied Tiles\n- Before placing an entity, ensure the target tile is unoccupied and suitable for placement. Consider adjusting the spacing, changing the direction, or selecting a different reference position to avoid collisions with existing entities.\n\n### Inserter Alignment and Refueling Issues\n- Regularly check the alignment of inserters to ensure they are correctly positioned to transfer items between entities.\n- Ensure inserters are refueled with coal or another suitable fuel to maintain their operation.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Iron Ore\n- Verify the setup of inserters to ensure they are correctly configured to transfer iron ore from the chest to the furnace. Adjust the inserter's position or direction if necessary.\n\n### Chest Full Warning\n- Regularly monitor and manage the inventory of chests to prevent them from becoming full, which can halt mining operations. Remove excess items or expand storage capacity as needed."}
