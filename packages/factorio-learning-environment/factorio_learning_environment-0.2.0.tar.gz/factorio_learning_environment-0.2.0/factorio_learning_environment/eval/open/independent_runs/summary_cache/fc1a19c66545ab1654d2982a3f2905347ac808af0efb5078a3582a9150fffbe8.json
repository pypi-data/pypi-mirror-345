{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and places it into the adjacent chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the stone furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates, but currently has no ingredients to process.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Empty Furnace Output\n- Ensure that the furnace has the necessary ingredients (iron ore) for smelting. Regularly check and refill the furnace with iron ore to maintain production.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Alignment and Refueling\n- Verify the alignment and positioning of inserters to ensure they can effectively transfer items between entities. Ensure inserters are consistently refueled to maintain their operation.\n\n### Errors with Chest Placement\n- Avoid placing entities in occupied tiles. Before placing a new chest or any entity, ensure the target tile is unoccupied. Consider adjusting the spacing or direction if necessary.\n\n### Errors with Inventory Management\n- Regularly monitor and manage the inventory to prevent chests from becoming full, which can halt production. Extract items from chests to free up space for continuous operation.\n\n### Errors with Extracting from Non-existent Entities\n- Ensure that the targeted entity exists and contains the required items before attempting extraction. Double-check the entity's position and contents to avoid extraction errors."}
