{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) extracting iron ore, with fuel inventory of coal.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-14.5, -48.5) and (-15.5, -48.5) for storage.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5) transferring items between entities.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (-12.0, -48.0) and (-10.0, -48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates. The furnace at (-12.0, -48.0) is currently working, while the one at (-10.0, -48.0) has no ingredients to smelt.\n- **Additional Wooden Chests** positioned at various locations for storing iron plates:\n  - (-7.5, -48.5) with 60 iron plates\n  - (-6.5, -48.5) and (-6.5, -49.5) each with 1500 iron plates\n  - (-5.5, -48.5) with 1500 iron plates\n  - (-4.5, -48.5) with 62 iron plates\n  - (-3.5, -48.5) empty\n  - (-14.5, -46.5) with 676 iron ore and 37 iron plates\n\n### Inserter and Transport System\n- **Burner Inserters** at various positions for moving items between entities:\n  - (-14.5, -47.5) working, transferring items from chests to other entities.\n  - (-11.5, -46.5) and (-11.5, -45.5) waiting for source items.\n  - (-8.5, -47.5) waiting for source items, with a warning of inserter waiting for source items.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Blockage at Inserter Drop Position\n- Ensure that the destination of the inserter's drop position is not blocked. Regularly check and clear any blockages to maintain smooth operation.\n\n### Extraction Errors\n- Ensure that the entity from which you are trying to extract items has the required items available. Check the inventory of the entity before attempting extraction.\n\n### Fuel Management\n- Keep track of fuel levels in burner entities to prevent them from stopping due to lack of fuel. Regularly refuel to ensure continuous operation.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Verify that the source entity has items available for the inserter to pick up. If not, adjust the supply chain to ensure availability.\n\n### Furnace Warnings\n- Address warnings such as \"no ingredients to smelt\" by ensuring that furnaces have a steady supply of raw materials for processing."}
