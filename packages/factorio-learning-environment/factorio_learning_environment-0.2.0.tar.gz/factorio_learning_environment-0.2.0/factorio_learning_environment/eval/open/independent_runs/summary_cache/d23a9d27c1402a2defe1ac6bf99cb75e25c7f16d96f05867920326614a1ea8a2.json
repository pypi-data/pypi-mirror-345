{"content": "Based on the execution logs, here is the updated report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing Setup (around x=41-45, y=-80 to -82)\nComplex automation setup consisting of:\n- Burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0) mining coal, working status\n- Wooden chest at (41.5, -80.5) storing coal, currently contains ~570 coal\n- Two burner inserters:\n  - First inserter at (42.5, -80.5) facing LEFT, picks from (43.5, -80.5) and drops to chest (41.5, -80.5)\n  - Second inserter at (43.5, -80.5) facing RIGHT, picks from (42.5, -80.5) and drops to (44.5, -80.5)\n- Transport belt group starting at (42.5, -81.5) extending to (43.5, -81.5), currently empty\n- Stone furnace at (45.0, -81.0), currently idle with no ingredients\n\nERROR TIPS\n1. Entity Placement Conflicts\n- Ensure target location is clear before placing entities\n- Check for existing objects or terrain restrictions before placement\n- Multiple failed attempts to place second inserter due to placement conflicts at:\n  - (44.5, -81.5)\n  - (44.0, -80.5)\n  - (43.5, -81.5)\n\n2. Inserter Configuration\n- Pay attention to inserter rotation and pickup/drop positions\n- Multiple rotation adjustments were needed to get the correct orientation\n- Ensure inserters can reach their intended pickup and drop locations\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nImportant Variables:\n- second_inserter: BurnerInserter\n- first_inserter: BurnerInserter\n- drill: BurnerMiningDrill\n- chest: Chest\n- belt: BeltGroup\n\nFunctions:\n- place_entity(): Places entities on the map, can fail if location is occupied\n- rotate_entity(): Changes entity orientation\n\nEntity States:\n- EntityStatus.WORKING: Entity is functioning normally\n- EntityStatus.WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS: Entity is waiting for items to process\n- EntityStatus.NO_INGREDIENTS: Entity lacks required materials\n- EntityStatus.NORMAL: Entity is in normal state\n- EntityStatus.EMPTY: Entity contains no items"}
