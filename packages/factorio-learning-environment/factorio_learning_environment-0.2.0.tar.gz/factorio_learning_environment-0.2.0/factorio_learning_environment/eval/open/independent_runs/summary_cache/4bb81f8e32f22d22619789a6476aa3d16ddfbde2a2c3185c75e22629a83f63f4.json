{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) which extracts iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-15.5, -48.5) and (-14.5, -48.5) for storing extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5) which transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0) which smelts iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-14.5, -47.5) which is responsible for moving items between entities.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -46.5) for storing smelted iron plates.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage Facility at Position (-6.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-10.0, -48.0) which smelts iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-8.5, -47.5) which transfers iron plates from the furnace to the storage chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-6.5, -48.5) for storing iron plates.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-7.5, -47.5) for additional storage.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Undefined Entities\n- Ensure that all entities referenced in your code are correctly defined and exist on the map. For example, the error \"Could not find entity at x=-11.5 y=-44.5: name 'Chest' is not defined\" suggests that the entity 'Chest' was referenced but not defined or placed.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Check that the source items are available for the inserters to pick up. The message \"Inserter at x=-11.5 y=-45.5 is waiting for source items\" indicates that the inserter is operational but lacks items to transfer.\n\n### Errors with Inventory Management\n- Ensure that inventories are not full when attempting to insert items. The error \"Could not insert: Failed to insert iron-plate into stone-furnace at position {x = -10, y = -48. Attempted to insert 50 items. Inventory is full\" indicates that the target inventory cannot accept more items.\n\n### Errors with Unbound Local Variables\n- Verify that all local variables are properly initialized before use. The error \"UnboundLocalError: cannot access local variable 'x' where it is not associated with a value\" suggests that a variable was used before being assigned a value.\n\n### Errors with No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to perform smelting operations. The warning \"no ingredients to smelt\" indicates that the furnace is operational but lacks the required input materials.\n\n### Errors with No Fuel\n- Regularly refuel entities that require fuel to operate, such as burner mining drills and inserters, to prevent interruptions in production. The warning \"out of fuel\" indicates that the entity has stopped functioning due to lack of fuel."}
