{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Coal Mining Setup at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner mining drill** at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0)  \n- **Wooden chest** at position (x=41.5, y=-80.5)  \nThe burner mining drill is configured to drop coal into the wooden chest.\n\n---\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when placing entities on non-buildable tiles\n- Ensure the target tile is clear and buildable before attempting to place entities like stone furnaces or burner mining drills.  \n- Example: Attempting to place a stone furnace at (x=44.0, y=-79.0) or a burner mining drill at (x=44.0, y=-84.0) failed due to non-buildable tiles.\n\n#### Errors when referencing undefined variables\n- Always define variables before referencing them.  \n- Example: The variable `coal_drill_2` was referenced without being defined, causing a `NameError`.\n\n#### Errors when attempting to interact with non-existent entities\n- Verify the existence of an entity at a specific position before interacting with it.  \n- Example: Attempting to get a stone furnace at (x=-13.5, y=-44.5) failed because no such entity exists at that position.\n\n#### Errors when inserting items into non-existent or incompatible entities\n- Ensure the target entity exists and can accept the item being inserted.  \n- Example: Attempting to insert coal into a furnace failed because no furnace was found nearby.\n\n#### Errors when extracting items from entities\n- Ensure the entity being extracted from is within reach and contains the desired items.  \n- Example: Extracting coal from a chest at (x=41.5, y=-80.5) succeeded, but ensure the chest is accessible and contains the required items."}
