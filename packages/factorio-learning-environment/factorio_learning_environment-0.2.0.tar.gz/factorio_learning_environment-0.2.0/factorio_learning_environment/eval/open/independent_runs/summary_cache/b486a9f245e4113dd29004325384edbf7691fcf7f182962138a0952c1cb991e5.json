{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-16.0, -51.0) with a drop position at (-16.5, -52.5). The drill is currently working and fueled with coal. It has a warning indicating that the output is blocked by an item on the ground, suggesting no sink entity is in place to accept the output.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0). The furnace is fueled with coal and is currently working, processing iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities from a position\n- Verify that the entity type you are trying to retrieve exists at the specified position before attempting to get it.\n\n### Errors with unexpected keyword arguments in function calls\n- Double-check the function signature to ensure that all arguments passed are expected and correctly named.\n\n### Errors when inserting items with incorrect data types\n- Ensure that the data types of the variables used in operations like insertion match the expected types. For instance, ensure numerical values are used where numbers are expected.\n\n### Errors when moving entities to a new location\n- Confirm that the destination location is valid and unoccupied before attempting to move an entity there."}
