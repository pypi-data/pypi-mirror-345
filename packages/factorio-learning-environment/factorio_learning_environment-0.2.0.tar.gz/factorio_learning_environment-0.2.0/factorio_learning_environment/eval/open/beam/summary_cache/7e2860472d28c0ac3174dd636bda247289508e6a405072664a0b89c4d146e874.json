I can craft 2 copper cables from the 2 copper plates I have.\n2. **Craft Electronic Circuits**: Each electronic circuit requires 3 copper cables and 1 iron plate. I need to ensure I have enough iron plates for this.\n3. **Gather Iron Plates**: I currently have 4 iron ore, which I can smelt into iron plates.\n\nLet's start by crafting the copper cables from the copper plates.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Craft 2 copper cables from the 2 copper plates\ncraft_item(Prototype.CopperCable, quantity=2)\nprint(f\"Current Inventory after crafting Copper Cables: {inspect_inventory()}\")  # Check inventory after crafting\n\n# Now, I need to smelt the iron ore into iron plates\n# First, I will check if I have a furnace available for smelting iron ore\nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")  # Check for available furnaces to smelt iron ore", "summary_range": "[1-50]"}
