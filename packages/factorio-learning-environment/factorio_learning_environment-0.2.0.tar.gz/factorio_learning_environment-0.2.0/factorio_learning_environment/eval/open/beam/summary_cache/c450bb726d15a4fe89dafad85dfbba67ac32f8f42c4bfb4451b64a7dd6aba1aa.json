{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Wooden Chest at position(-4.5, 18.5)\nThis structure is used to store resources. It contains the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest (position -4.5, 18.5)\n\n### Stone Furnace at position(-3.0, 19.0)\nThis structure is used to smelt ores into plates and bricks. It consists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace (position -3.0, 19.0)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it. For instance, the Stone Furnace could not be placed at (-4.5, 18.5) due to an existing object in the way.\n\n### Errors when crafting items\n- Research the required technology before attempting to craft items that are locked by technology, such as the Stone Wall.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into entities\n- Ensure that the entity you are inserting into does not already contain items that conflict with the insertion. For example, the Stone Furnace could not accept iron ore because it already contained stone.\n\n### Errors related to undefined variables\n- Make sure all variables used in your code are defined before use. For example, 'remaining_iron_plates' was not defined, which caused an error when trying to insert iron ore.\n\n### Errors when inventory is empty\n- Always check your inventory before attempting to insert items into entities. For instance, the error occurred because there was no iron ore available to insert into the Stone Furnace."}
