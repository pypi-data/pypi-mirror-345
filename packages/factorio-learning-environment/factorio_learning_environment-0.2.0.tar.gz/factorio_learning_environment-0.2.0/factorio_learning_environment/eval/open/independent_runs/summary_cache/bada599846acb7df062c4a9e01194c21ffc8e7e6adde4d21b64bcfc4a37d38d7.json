{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility\nThis structure is responsible for mining iron ore and smelting it into iron plates. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0): This drill extracts iron ore from the resource patch. It is fueled with coal and is currently working, but has a warning indicating the chest at the drop position is full.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5): This chest stores the mined iron ore. It currently contains 21 units of iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5): This inserter is responsible for transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace. It is currently out of fuel but is aligned correctly.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0): This furnace is used to smelt iron ore into iron plates. It is fueled with coal but currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Inserter Alignment and Fueling\n- Ensure that inserters are correctly aligned and fueled to transfer materials between entities. Misalignment or lack of fuel can prevent the transfer of resources, leading to production halts.\n\n### Chest Overflow\n- Regularly monitor and empty chests to prevent overflow, especially when they are used as drop-off points for mining drills. Full chests can halt mining operations.\n\n### Furnace Input Issues\n- Check that furnaces are receiving the necessary ingredients to function. Ensure that inserters are correctly transferring materials into the furnace to avoid production stoppages.\n\n### Fuel Management\n- Keep track of fuel levels in all entities that require it, such as mining drills and inserters, to maintain continuous operation. Refuel these entities promptly to avoid interruptions."}
