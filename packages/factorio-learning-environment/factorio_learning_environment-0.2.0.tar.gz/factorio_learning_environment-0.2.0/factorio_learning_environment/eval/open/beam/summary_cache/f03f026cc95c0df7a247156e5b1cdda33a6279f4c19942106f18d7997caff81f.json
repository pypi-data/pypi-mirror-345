This will allow for a proper analysis of what was attempted, any errors that occurred, and the outcomes of those actions.\n\n2. **Common Patterns**: If you have specific code snippets or commands you would like to discuss, please share them. I can then provide tips, successful patterns, and examples based on that information.\n\n3. **Error Handling**: If there were any errors during execution, sharing those error messages would be helpful for troubleshooting and providing guidance.\n\n### Example of a Helpful Response:\n- **Attempted Action**: Describe what you were trying to achieve (e.g., \"I tried to create a new factory setup\").\n- **Code Snippet**: Include the relevant code or commands.\n- **Error Messages**: If any errors occurred, please specify them.\n- **Expected Outcome**: What did you expect to happen?\n- **Actual Outcome**: What happened instead?\n\nOnce you provide more context or specific details, I will be able to give you a comprehensive report and useful feedback!", "summary_range": "[1-278]"}
