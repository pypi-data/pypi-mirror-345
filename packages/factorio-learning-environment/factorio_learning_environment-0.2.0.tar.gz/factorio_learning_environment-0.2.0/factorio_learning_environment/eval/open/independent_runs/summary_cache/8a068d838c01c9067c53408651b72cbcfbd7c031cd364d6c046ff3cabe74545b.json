Move closer to the target position before attempting to connect.\n\n### Errors when placing entities too far away\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to place the new entity before attempting to place it. The maximum distance for placement is 10 tiles.\n\n### Errors when the lab is without power\n- Check the connections to the power network and ensure that the lab is connected to a power source. If it is not connected, adjust the layout to include power lines or poles.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it. Check for existing entities in the target position."}
