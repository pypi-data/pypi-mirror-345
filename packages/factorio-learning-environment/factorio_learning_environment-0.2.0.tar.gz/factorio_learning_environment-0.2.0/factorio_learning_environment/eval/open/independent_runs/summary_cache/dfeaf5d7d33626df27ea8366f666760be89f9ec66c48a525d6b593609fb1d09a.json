{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (9.0, -64.0) with coal as fuel, currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n- Stone Furnace at position (6.0, -62.0) with coal as fuel, currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Storage Area\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (7.5, -61.5) with no inventory.\n- Wooden Chest at position (6.5, -59.5) containing 227 iron plates.\n\n### Insertion and Power System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) not receiving electricity, connected to a stone furnace and a wooden chest.\n- Small Electric Poles at various positions (5.5, -60.5), (7.5, -60.5), (5.5, -59.5), (7.5, -59.5) for power distribution.\n\n### Research Lab\nConsists of the following entity:\n- Lab with automation science packs at position (not specified), currently not powered.\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Boiler at position (-5.5, 24.0) with coal as fuel, not connected to any fluid source.\n- Steam Engine at position (-1.5, 24.5), not connected to power network and lacking input liquid.\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5) working and supplying water.\n- PipeGroup connecting the offshore pump to the boiler.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Crafting Due to Insufficient Resources\n- Ensure that you have enough resources in your inventory before attempting to craft items. Specifically, verify the quantity of copper cables needed for crafting small electric poles.\n\n### Errors in Power Connectivity\n- Check that all electrical entities, such as inserters and labs, are properly connected to a power source. Ensure that small electric poles are correctly placed to provide power to these entities.\n\n### Errors in Fluid Connectivity\n- Verify that all fluid-based entities, such as boilers and steam engines, are properly connected to their respective fluid sources. Ensure that there are no missing connections in the pipe network."}
