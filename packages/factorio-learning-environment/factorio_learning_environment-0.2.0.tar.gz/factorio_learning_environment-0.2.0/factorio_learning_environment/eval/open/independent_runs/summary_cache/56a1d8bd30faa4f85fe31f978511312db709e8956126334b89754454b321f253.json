Check for gaps or misalignments in the pipe network.\n\n### Errors in Crafting\n- Ensure that all required sub-ingredients are available and that crafting machines or furnaces are used when necessary. For example, iron plates require smelting in a furnace.\n\n### General Connection Errors\n- Verify that all components in the electricity generator are properly connected. Ensure that the steam engine and boiler are connected to the offshore pump and pipes to function correctly."}
