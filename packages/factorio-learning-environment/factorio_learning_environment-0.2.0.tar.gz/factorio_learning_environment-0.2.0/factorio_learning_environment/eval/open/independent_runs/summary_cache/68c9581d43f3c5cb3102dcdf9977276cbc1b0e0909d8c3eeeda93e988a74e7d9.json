Several attempts were made to establish a Lab at (0.5, 2.5) for supplying Automation Science Packs, but all placement and crafting attempts failed. The agent also referenced existing smelting furnaces (one at (5.0, 5.0) and another copper furnace at (\u201327.0, \u201360.0)) for resource processing; however, these were pre\u2010existing entities used for operations rather than structures the agent built.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 API Usage Errors:\n  \u2013 Avoid passing unsupported keyword arguments (e.g. \u201cradius\u201d) when calling get_entities; ensure the invocation matches the function\u2019s signature.\n  \u2013 Do not supply extraneous positional arguments if the function expects none.\n\n\u2022 NoneType Iteration:\n  \u2013 When filtering entity lists (such as existing labs), first verify that the returned value is valid (use an empty list as a fallback instead of None) to prevent iteration errors.\n\n\u2022 Lab Placement and Crafting Failures:\n  \u2013 Confirm the required lab item is present in inventory before attempting to place it at (0.5, 2.5).\n  \u2013 Ensure all prerequisite resources and sub-ingredients (for example, iron-plate, iron-gear-wheel, copper-plate, copper-cable, and electronic-circuit) are available and producible via proper crafting or smelting processes before initiating lab crafting.\n  \u2013 Verify that the necessary production facilities (crafting machines or furnaces) are operational to produce intermediary components, reducing repeated failures during lab creation attempts."}
