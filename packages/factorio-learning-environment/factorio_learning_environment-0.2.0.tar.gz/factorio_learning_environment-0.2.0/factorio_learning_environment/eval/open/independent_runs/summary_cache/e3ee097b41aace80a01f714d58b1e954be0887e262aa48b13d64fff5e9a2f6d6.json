Check for nearby entities that might be blocking the placement.\n* Errors when attempting to place an entity at a position occupied by another entity\n  - Ensure the target position is clear of other entities before attempting to place a new entity.\n* Errors when connecting transport belts directly to non-belt entities\n  - Use an inserter to transfer items from non-belt entities (like chests) to transport belts.\n* Errors due to accessing non-existent attributes of an object\n  - Verify the attributes of an object before attempting to access them to avoid attribute errors.\n* Errors due to undefined variables\n  - Ensure all variables are defined before using them in your code.\n* Errors when output is blocked by items on the ground\n  - Ensure there is a sink entity in place to accept the output, or clear the items on the ground.\n* Errors when inspecting inventory of an entity that does not have an inventory\n  - Check if an entity has an inventory before attempting to inspect it.\n* Errors when attempting to insert items without having the required items in inventory\n  - Check your inventory before attempting to insert items into other entities.\n* Errors due to output being blocked by items on the ground\n  - The burner inserter at position(-46.5, 1.5) is experiencing output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n* Errors when extracting items from an entity with quantity 0\n  - Check if the quantity of items to be extracted is greater than 0 before attempting to extract.\n* Errors due to undefined names\n  - Ensure all names are defined before using them\n* Errors when chest is full\n  - Ensure the chest is not full before attempting to insert items into it.\n* Errors when inserter is waiting for source items and chest is full\n  - The inserter at position(-42.5, 1.5) is waiting for source items and the input chest is full. Ensure the input chest is not full before attempting to insert items.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n* Important variables:\n"}
