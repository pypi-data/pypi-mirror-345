{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Wooden Chest at position(41.5, -80.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest (position(41.5, -80.5)) with an inventory containing coal.\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position(41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position(41.0, -82.0)) currently mining coal with a fuel inventory containing coal.\n\n### Stone Furnace at position(-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace (position(-15.0, -50.0)) with a fuel inventory containing coal and an output inventory containing iron plates. The furnace currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n- **Errors when the Wooden Chest is full**: \n  - Ensure to empty the Wooden Chest at (41.5, -80.5) before attempting to continue mining with the Burner Mining Drill, as it cannot drop off resources when the chest is full.\n  \n- **Errors when the Burner Mining Drill is not collecting coal**: \n  - Check the status of the Burner Mining Drill to ensure it has enough fuel and that the drop position is not blocked or full.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- **Utility Functions**: \n  - No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the current execution steps.\n\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `coal`: int (current amount of coal in inventory)\n  - `wood`: int (current amount of wood in inventory)\n  - `iron-plate`: int (current amount of iron plates in inventory)\n  - `burner-mining-drill`: object (represents the mining drill entity)\n  - `wooden-chest`: object (represents the wooden chest entity)\n  - `stone-furnace`: object (represents the stone furnace entity)"}
