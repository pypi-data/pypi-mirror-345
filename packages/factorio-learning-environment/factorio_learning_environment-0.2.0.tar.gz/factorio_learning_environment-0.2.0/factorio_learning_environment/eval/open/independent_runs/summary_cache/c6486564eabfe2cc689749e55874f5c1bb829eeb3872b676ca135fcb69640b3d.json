{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (0.0, 0.0) and (2.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with iron ore input and iron plate output.\n- Stone Furnace at position (2.0, 0.0) with iron ore input and iron plate output.\n\n### Coal Mining and Distribution System at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) extracting coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (40.5, -83.5) for storing coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (41.5, -83.5) transferring coal from the mining drill to the wooden chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (42.5, -83.5) for additional coal storage.\n- Burner Inserter at position (41.5, -80.5) waiting for source items.\n- Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -79.5) storing coal with a significant inventory.\n- BeltGroup with inputs and outputs between positions (42.5, -83.5) to (45.5, -83.5) for coal transportation.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Inserters are Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entity (e.g., mining drill or chest) has items available for the inserter to pick up. Regularly check and maintain the supply chain to prevent inserters from idling.\n\n### Errors with Burner Mining Drill Running Out of Fuel\n- Regularly refuel burner mining drills to prevent them from stopping operations. Monitor fuel levels and automate refueling if possible to maintain continuous operation."}
