Each furnace is paired with burner\u2011inserters and a wooden chest to automatically feed raw ore into smelting operations.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Automation Setup\nConsists of:\n\u2022 A burner\u2011mining drill at (\u201315.0, \u201350.0) that extracts iron\u2011ore.\n\u2022 A wooden chest at (\u201313.5, \u201351.5) to collect the extracted resource.\n\u2022 Transport belts linking the drill to the chest.\n\n### Steam Power Generation System\nConsists of:\n\u2022 A boiler at (8.0, 20.5) which provides the necessary steam.\n\u2022 A network of steam engines deployed at (0.5, 9.5), (18.5, 11.5), (1.5, 13.5), (13.5, 14.5), (19.5, 14.5), (22.5, 18.5), (17.5, 20.5), (12.5, 21.5) and (4.5, 23.5).\n\u2022 An extra steam engine intended to join the network remains unplaceable due to severe congestion around the boiler area.\n\n### Automation Research Lab\nConsists of:\n\u2022 A laboratory configured for processing automation science packs.\n\u2022 The lab remains unpowered (status NO_POWER), awaiting proper electrical connection.\n\n### Electrical and Transport Infrastructure\nConsists of:\n\u2022 Multiple interlinked Electricity Groups (composed of power poles and connection nodes) that distribute power across the base.\n\u2022 Various Belt Groups and Pipe Groups ensuring connectivity for materials and fluids throughout the facility.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n### Persistent Extra Steam Engine Placement Error\n\u2022 The extra steam engine consistently fails to be placed because the area around the boiler at (8.0, 20.5) remains severely congested with overlapping burner\u2011inserters, transport belts, and other interfering entities.\n\u2022 Recommendation: Manually inspect and clear the boiler and adjacent connection interfaces. Remove, reposition, or adjust interfering entities to create sufficient clearance. Alternatively, relocate the extra steam engine to a dedicated area away from the congested zone.\n\n### Fuel and Source Item Shortages on Burner\u2011Inserters\n\u2022 Multiple burner\u2011inserters are reporting \u201cout of fuel\u201d or are \u201cwaiting for source items,\u201d disrupting their operation.\n\u2022 Recommendation: Optimize fuel delivery routes and verify that inserter placement allows easy access to fuel (e.g. coal) and source items. Adjust layout where necessary to ensure a stable resource flow.\n\n### Connectivity Gaps in the Steam Engine Network\n\u2022 Several steam engines display errors such as \u201cnot connected to power network,\u201d \u201cno input liquid,\u201d and \u201cno fluid present in connections,\u201d undermining power generation.\n\u2022 Recommendation: Confirm that all connection points between the boiler, steam engines, and the fluid systems are correctly aligned and unobstructed. Reposition or clear nearby entities to restore proper connectivity.\n"}
