{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-20, -70)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -70.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-18.0, -70.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (-23.5, -69.5) storing iron ore and copper ore\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) connected to transport belts and a wooden chest\n- Transport Belts connecting the mining drill to the furnaces\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-14, -53)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) connected to transport belts\n- Stone Furnace at position (-21.0, -62.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (-12.5, -54.5) storing iron ore\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5) transferring items from the transport belt to the chest\n- Transport Belts connecting the mining drill to the inserter and chest\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (53, -83)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5) storing coal\n\n### Iron Plate Storage Facility at Position (0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5) storing coal, iron ore, and iron plates\n- Burner Inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) transferring items between chests\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Ensure that the target tile is free of other entities before attempting to place a new entity. If an entity already exists at the target position, remove it before proceeding.\n\n### Errors due to full inventory or storage\n- Regularly check and manage the inventory of chests and other storage entities to prevent them from becoming full, which can halt production processes.\n\n### Errors due to lack of fuel\n- Ensure that all fuel-dependent entities, such as burner mining drills and burner inserters, have a sufficient supply of fuel to maintain continuous operation. Regularly refuel these entities to prevent downtime."}
