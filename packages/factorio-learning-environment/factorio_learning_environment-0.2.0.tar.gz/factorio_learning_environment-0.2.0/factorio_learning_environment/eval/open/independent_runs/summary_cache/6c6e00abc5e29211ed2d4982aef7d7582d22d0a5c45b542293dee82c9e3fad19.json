{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining Operation at Position (x=41.0, y=-82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0) extracting coal.\n- Transport Belt at position (x=39.5, y=-83.5) transporting coal.\n- Wooden Chests at positions (x=40.5, y=-83.5), (x=41.5, y=-83.5), and (x=42.5, y=-83.5) for coal storage.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) and (x=10.0, y=0.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserters at positions (x=1.5, y=0.5), (x=3.5, y=0.5), (x=6.5, y=0.5), (x=8.5, y=0.5), and (x=11.5, y=0.5) for moving items between chests and furnaces.\n- Wooden Chests at positions (x=2.5, y=0.5), (x=7.5, y=0.5), (x=10.5, y=1.5), and (x=12.5, y=0.5) for storing iron plates.\n\n### Belt System\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (x=3.5, y=0.5) to (x=5.5, y=0.5) and (x=4.5, y=0.5) to (x=6.5, y=0.5), facilitating the movement of items between different parts of the production line.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using object methods incorrectly\n- Ensure that objects are used correctly according to their type. For example, a 'Chest' object should not be called as a function. Verify the object's methods and properties before use.\n\n### Errors due to undefined names\n- Make sure all entities and prototypes are correctly defined and imported. For instance, use 'burner_inserter' instead of 'BurnerInserter' to avoid NameError.\n\n### Errors when accessing non-existent entities\n- Verify the existence of entities at specified positions before attempting to access them. This can prevent errors such as \"No entity of type wooden-chest found at the specified position.\"\n\n### Errors when inspecting inventory of entities\n- Ensure the entity's inventory is accessible and correctly referenced. Avoid attempting to access attributes that do not exist, such as 'is_full' on an 'Inventory' object.\n\n### Errors when clearing blockages\n- Ensure that the logic for clearing blockages on belts is correctly implemented and that the entities involved are properly referenced and accessible."}
