{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0)\n  - Fuel: 4 units of coal\n  - Status: Working\n  - Warnings: Output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Neighbours: Stone Furnace\n  - Drop Position: (x=-16.5, y=-52.5)\n  - Resources: 40,000 units of iron ore\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)\n  - Fuel: 14 units of coal\n  - Status: No Ingredients\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Furnace Result: 60 units of iron plate\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied locations\n- Ensure that the target location is free of other entities before attempting to place a new entity such as a Wooden Chest, Burner Inserter, or Transport Belt.\n\n### Errors when moving entities to new locations\n- Verify that the destination location is suitable and unoccupied before moving entities like the Stone Furnace.\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities from specific positions\n- Confirm the existence of the entity at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it. This will prevent errors such as \"No entity of type stone-furnace found at the specified position.\"\n\n### Errors due to blocked output\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity in place to accept the output from entities like the Burner Mining Drill to prevent output blockage."}
