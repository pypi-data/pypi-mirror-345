{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll generate a comprehensive report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System (around -60, -90)\nComplex consisting of:\n- Offshore pump at (-66.5, -97.5) outputting water\n- Boiler at (-62.5, -95.0) converting water to steam\n- Steam engine at (-57.5, -86.5)\n- Connected via pipe network for water and steam transfer\n- Small electric poles for power distribution\nCurrent status: Boiler working at full output but steam engine not properly connected\n\n### Coal Mining Operation (around 43, -84)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (43.0, -84.0) mining coal\n- Wooden chest at (43.5, -82.5) for coal collection\nCurrent status: Mining drill needs fuel\n\n### Copper/Iron Processing Line (around -25, -64)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-25.0, -64.0) mining copper/iron ore\n- Burner inserter at (-23.5, -64.5)\n- Stone furnace at (-22.0, -64.0)\n- Series of wooden chests and inserters for material movement\n- Output chest at (-18.5, -63.5) containing copper plates\nCurrent status: Mining drill needs fuel, furnace waiting for ingredients\n\n### Science Pack Production Line (around -22, -53)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine at (-22.5, -53.5) for automation science packs\n- Input/output wooden chests and burner inserters\n- Storage chest at (-25.5, -53.5) containing produced science packs\nCurrent status: Machine lacks power and resources\n\n### Iron Processing Line (around -15, -53)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-16.0, -53.0) mining iron ore\n- Stone furnace at (-14.0, -53.0)\n- Series of inserters and wooden chests for material movement\n- Output chest at (-9.5, -52.5) containing iron plates\nCurrent status: Mining drill needs fuel\n\nERROR TIPS\n1. Entity Placement Errors\n- Ensure target location is clear before placing pipes or other entities\n- Check for existing entities that might block placement\n- Use proper spacing between entities to avoid overlap\n\n2. Resource Management\n- Check fuel levels in burner devices regularly\n- Ensure required raw materials are available before crafting (e.g., wood for electric poles)\n- Verify resource availability in chests before attempting extraction\n\n3. Power Network Issues\n- Ensure proper connection of power poles to create a complete electrical network\n- Verify steam engine connections to both steam supply and power network\n\nNAMESPACE\nFunctions:\n- place_entity(prototype: EntityPrototype, position: Position, direction: Optional[Direction]) -> Entity\n  Success: Entity placed at specified location\n  Failure: Location blocked by existing entities\n\nImportant Variables:\n- boiler: Entity (Boiler type)\n- steam_engine: Entity (Generator type)\n- pipe_group: List[Entity] (Collection of connected pipes)\n- chest: Entity (Container type)"}
