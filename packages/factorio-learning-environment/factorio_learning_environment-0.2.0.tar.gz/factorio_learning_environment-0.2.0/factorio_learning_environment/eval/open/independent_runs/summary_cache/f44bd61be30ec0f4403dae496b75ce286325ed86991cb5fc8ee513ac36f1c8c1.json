{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Transfer Station at Position (40.5, -83.5) and (42.5, -83.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (40.5, -83.5) with coal inventory of 800 units.\n- Wooden Chest at position (42.5, -83.5) with coal inventory of 202 units.\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0), currently waiting for space in the destination chest.\n- Burner Inserter at position (41.5, -83.5), also waiting for space in the destination chest.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (61.0, -54.0) with a current inventory of 11 iron plates and no ingredients to smelt.\n- Stone Furnace at position (64.0, -53.0) actively working with 3 iron ore and producing iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (61.5, -52.5) with coal inventory.\n- Wooden Chest at position (62.5, -53.5) with coal inventory.\n- Wooden Chest at position (62.5, -52.5) with coal inventory.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Extracting Items\n- Ensure that the target entity (e.g., furnace) has the required items available for extraction before attempting to extract. The error in step 759 indicates an attempt to extract iron plates from a furnace that did not have the specified quantity.\n\n### Errors due to Full Inventory in Chests\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are full to prevent mining drills and inserters from halting operations. Both the burner mining drill and burner inserter at the coal transfer station are waiting due to a full chest at position (40.5, -83.5).\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - `extract_item(item: Prototype, entity: Entity, quantity: int)`: Attempts to extract a specified quantity of an item from a given entity. Failure occurs if the entity does not have enough of the item.\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `extracted_plates: int`: Represents the number of iron plates extracted from a furnace."}
