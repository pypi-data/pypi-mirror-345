{"content": "# Factorio Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electric Network\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Small Electric Pole at position (2.5, 2.5) - Status: NOT_PLUGGED_IN_ELECTRIC_NETWORK\n- Small Electric Pole at position (1.5, 1.5) - Status: NOT_PLUGGED_IN_ELECTRIC_NETWORK\n- Small Electric Pole at position (9.5, 6.5) - Status: NOT_PLUGGED_IN_ELECTRIC_NETWORK\n- Small Electric Pole at position (9.5, 8.5) - Connected to lab at (6.5, 6.5)\n- Small Electric Pole at position (9.5, 7.5) - Connected to lab at (6.5, 6.5)\n- Small Electric Pole at position (8.5, 9.5) - Connected to lab at (6.5, 6.5)\n- Small Electric Pole at position (7.5, 9.5) - Connected to lab at (6.5, 6.5)\n\n### Lab\nLocated at position (6.5, 6.5) - Requires power to function.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to Electric Poles\n- **Entity NOT_PLUGGED_IN_ELECTRIC_NETWORK**: Ensure that electric poles are properly connected to the electric network. Check the positioning of poles and their connections to power sources.\n  \n### Errors when placing entities\n- **Could not place small-electric-pole**: This error indicates that there are no small electric poles in inventory. Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to place them.\n  \n### Errors related to Lab Power\n- **The lab is still not powered**: Verify that all electric poles connected to the lab are plugged into the electric network. If they are not, reposition or add additional poles as necessary.\n\n### Errors related to obstructing entities\n- **Obstructing entity**: If an entity is obstructing the placement of another, ensure to remove or relocate the obstructing entity before placing new structures.\n\n### Errors when trying to access non-existent entities\n- **Could not get Prototype.SmallElectricPole at position**: Ensure that the entity you are trying to access exists at the specified position. If it has been removed or relocated, update your references accordingly."}
