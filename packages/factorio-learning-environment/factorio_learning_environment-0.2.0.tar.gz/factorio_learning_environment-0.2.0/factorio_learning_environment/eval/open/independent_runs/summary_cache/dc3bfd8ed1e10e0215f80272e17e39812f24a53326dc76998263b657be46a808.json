{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll generate a comprehensive report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Smelting System (around x=41-48, y=-80)\nComplex automated system consisting of:\n- Burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0) mining coal, working status\n- Transport belt system from x=41.5 to x=45.5 at y=-80.5, all facing right, carrying coal\n- Burner inserter at (46.5, -80.5) picking up from belt at (45.5, -80.5) and dropping at (47.5, -80.5)\n- Stone furnace at (48.0, -80.0)\n\nSystem status:\n- Mining drill is operational with 31 coal as fuel\n- Belt system is working and carrying coal\n- Inserter has 49 coal as fuel but waiting for items to move\n- Furnace has 50 coal as fuel but no ingredients to process\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Conflicts\n- When placing entities, ensure the target location is clear of other entities and valid terrain (water tiles are invalid)\n- Pay attention to entity dimensions - furnaces are 2x2 while inserters and belts are 1x1\n\n### Alignment Issues\n- Keep consistent y-coordinates when building connected systems (the agent had to rebuild multiple times to fix y-coordinate misalignment)\n- Ensure proper spacing between components for inserters to function correctly\n- When connecting components, verify that inserter pickup and drop positions align with belt and furnace positions\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nFunctions:\n- place_entity(): Places entities in the world. Can fail if location is occupied or invalid\n\nImportant Variables:\n- EntityStatus: Enum tracking entity states (WORKING, NO_INGREDIENTS, WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION, etc)\n- Direction: Enum for entity orientations (RIGHT, LEFT, UP, DOWN)\n- Position: Type for coordinates (x, y)\n- Inventory: Type for storing items and quantities"}
