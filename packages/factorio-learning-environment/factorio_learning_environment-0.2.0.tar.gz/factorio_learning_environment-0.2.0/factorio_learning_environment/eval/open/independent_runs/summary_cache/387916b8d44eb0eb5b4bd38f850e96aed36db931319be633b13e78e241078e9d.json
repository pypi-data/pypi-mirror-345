{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll create a report summarizing the existing structures and error tips:\n\n# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Manufacturing Area at (0,0)\nConsists of multiple furnaces and automation structures:\n- 4 Stone furnaces at positions (0,0), (2,0), (5,0), and (8,0)\n- Burner inserter at (3.5,0.5) connecting furnaces\n- Wooden chests at (4.5,1.5) and (8.5,1.5)\n- Regular inserter at (9.5,1.5)\n- Assembling machine at (11.5,1.5) for automation science pack production\n- Output inserter at (13.5,1.5)\n- Collection chest at (14.5,1.5)\n\n### Secondary Production Area at (4,4)\n- Stone furnaces at (4,4) and (6,4)\n- Inserter at (4.5,2.5) connecting to chest system\n\n### Laboratory Complex\nMultiple labs connected to electricity group 41805, currently without power\n\n### Power Generation System (Incomplete)\n- Boiler at (-5.0,24.5) facing right\n- Offshore pump at (-7.5,25.5)\n- Both components currently not connected/operational\n\n### Transport System\nMultiple belt groups forming a logistics network:\n- Belt group from (4.5,2.5) to (2.5,2.5)\n- Belt group from (6.5,2.5) to (4.5,2.5)\n- Long belt group from (7.5,3.5) to (-4.5,19.5)\n- Belt group from (1.5,5.5) to (1.5,11.5)\n\n### Electrical Network\nElectricity group (ID: 41805) with multiple poles, currently not providing power\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Issues\n- Cannot place entities on water tiles - ensure placement location is on solid ground\n- Respect maximum placement distance (10 tiles) from player position - move closer to target location before placing\n- Verify entity footprint doesn't overlap with water or other entities before placement\n\n### Power System Setup Issues\n- Ensure boiler and offshore pump are properly connected before attempting to add fuel\n- Connect power components in correct order: offshore pump \u2192 boiler \u2192 steam engine\n- Place boiler with correct orientation to allow proper fluid flow\n\n### Resource Management\n- Verify fuel (coal/stone) is in inventory before attempting to insert into machines\n- Ensure you are close enough to target entity when attempting to extract resources\n- Check if target entity can accept the type of fuel being inserted\n\n### Connection Issues\n- Ensure fluid-carrying entities (pumps, boilers) are properly connected before operation\n- Verify power network connections are complete before expecting electrical components to work\n\n### System Status Verification\n- Define all required position variables before checking system status\n- Ensure all components exist before attempting to check their status\n- Verify entity types match expected types at given positions"}
