# Example SoloGM Playthrough Script: Starfall Legacy
#
# This script executes the commands outlined in example_game.md.
# It echoes each command, waits briefly, and then runs it.
#
# Note: Some steps require manual interaction (like editor prompts or AI feedback loops)
#       or dynamic IDs (like specific event IDs). These are noted in comments.
#       For simple confirmations (like adding an oracle interpretation as an event),
#       this script uses `yes |` to automatically confirm 'y'.

# Function to echo, sleep, and run a command
