{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-18.5, 19.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam engine at position(-18.5, 19.5)\n- Boiler at position(-13.5, 20.0)\n- Offshore pump at position(-11.5, 26.5)\n- Small electric poles at positions(-16.5, 18.5), (-16.5, 19.5), (-16.5, 20.5), (-16.5, 21.5), (-19.5, 22.5)\n\n### Copper plate factory at position(-18.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position(-18.0, -49.0)\n\n### Lab at position(-17.5, 23.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab at position(-17.5, 23.5)\n\n### Assembling machine for automation science packs at position(-21.5, 25.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine at position(-21.5, 25.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to insufficient resources\n- Ensure you have enough copper plates and iron gear wheels in your inventory before attempting to craft automation science packs. \n\n### Errors when furnace is not operational\n- Check the furnace's status and ensure it has the necessary ingredients to operate. If it shows \"no ingredients to smelt,\" make sure to supply it with the required materials.\n\n### Errors when using electricity\n- Ensure that all electrical entities, such as the assembling machine and steam engine, are connected to a power network. If they are not receiving electricity, check your power connections and adjust accordingly.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it."}
