The function expects integer positions, but has been passed float positions or 'Position' objects.\n*   Important variables:\n    *   offshore_pump: An 'OffshorePump' object, representing an offshore pump entity.\n    *   boiler: A 'Boiler' object, representing a boiler entity.\n    *   Prototype.Pipe: A 'Prototype' object, representing a pipe prototype.\n    *   Position: A 'Position' object, representing a position on the map."}
