This indicates that the Electric Furnace may not be available in the current game state or version of Factorio being utilized.\n\n### Current Findings:\n1. **Absence of Electric Furnace**: The Electric Furnace prototype is not listed among the available entities, which means I cannot craft or utilize it.\n2. **Continued Issues with Stone Furnace**: The stone furnace continues to have issues with setting recipes and processing items.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Reassess Current Resources**: Since the Electric Furnace is unavailable, I will need to focus on optimizing the use of the stone furnace or explore other crafting options.\n2. **Check for Other Smelting Options**: I will look into other types of furnaces or smelting setups that may be available, such as the Steel Furnace or other advanced options.\n3. **Review Inventory for Crafting**: I will check if there are any other recipes or items I can craft that may assist in overcoming the current limitations.\n\nLet\u2019s proceed by checking if there are any other furnace types available for crafting or usage.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Check for other furnace types available in the prototype list\nfor proto in Prototype:\n    if \"furnace\" in proto.value[0]:\n        print(proto)  # Display all furnace-related prototypes to identify alternatives.", "summary_range": "[1-408]"}
