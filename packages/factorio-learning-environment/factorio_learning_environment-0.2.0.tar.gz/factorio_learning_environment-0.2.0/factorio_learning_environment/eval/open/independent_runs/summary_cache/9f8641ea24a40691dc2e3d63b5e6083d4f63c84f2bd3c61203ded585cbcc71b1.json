{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Line at x=-2.0, y=-76.0\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (x=-2.0, y=-76.0) connected to\n- Stone furnace (x=-1.0, y=-74.0) connected to\n- Burner inserter (x=0.5, y=-74.5) that moves items to\n- Iron chest (x=1.5, y=-74.5)\n- Additional iron chest (x=0.5, y=-72.5) connected to the furnace\nCurrent status: Mining drill is out of fuel, furnace has no ingredients\n\n### Copper Ore Processing Line at x=-21.0, y=-73.0\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (x=-21.0, y=-73.0) that drops to\n- Iron chest (x=-21.5, y=-74.5) containing copper ore\n- Burner inserter (x=-20.5, y=-74.5) moves items to\n- Stone furnace (x=-19.0, y=-74.0)\nCurrent status: Mining drill is working, furnace is full of copper plates\n\n### Iron Plate Processing Line at x=3.0, y=-73.0\nConsists of:\n- Iron chest (x=1.5, y=-74.5) containing iron plates\n- Burner inserter (x=2.5, y=-74.5) oriented to move items to\n- Stone furnace (x=3.0, y=-73.0) connected to\n- Stone furnace (x=5.0, y=-73.0)\n- Burner inserter (x=6.5, y=-72.5) moves items to\n- Iron chest (x=7.5, y=-72.5)\n- Additional iron chest (x=3.5, y=-71.5) connected to both furnaces\nCurrent status: All furnaces have fuel but no ingredients\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Incorrect Inserter Configuration\n- The inserter at x=2.5, y=-74.5 has incorrect pickup/drop positions (pickup: x=2.5, y=-73.5, drop: x=2.5, y=-75.5) that don't align with the intended source and destination\n- Ensure inserter orientation and position allows it to properly reach both the source and destination entities\n\n### Resource Management\n- Mining drill at x=-2.0, y=-76.0 is out of fuel\n- Always ensure mining equipment has sufficient fuel before starting operations\n\n### Inventory Management\n- Attempting to insert coal when none is available in inventory\n- Check inventory contents before attempting to insert items into entities\n\n### Production Line Efficiency\n- Multiple furnaces have no ingredients despite having fuel\n- Ensure proper item flow through the production line by checking connections and inserter configurations"}
