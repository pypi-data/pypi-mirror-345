{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nNo structures have been successfully created on the map yet. The agent attempted to place offshore pumps and boilers, but these attempts failed due to various errors and unsuitable positions.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Offshore Pump Placement\n- **Validation Errors**: Ensure that the dimensions (height and width) provided for the offshore pump are valid integers.\n- **Type Errors**: When using functions or methods, ensure that the arguments passed are of the correct type. For instance, avoid passing objects like 'ModelPrivateAttr' where a string or number is expected.\n- **Callable Errors**: Ensure that objects used as functions are indeed callable. For example, avoid using 'Position' objects as if they were functions.\n- **Position Unsuitability**: Before placing an offshore pump, verify that the target position is suitable for placement. Consider checking the terrain and ensuring it meets the requirements for an offshore pump.\n\n### Errors with Boiler Placement\n- **Validation Errors**: Similar to offshore pumps, ensure that the dimensions (height and width) for the boiler are valid integers.\n- **Type Errors**: Ensure that the arguments passed to functions are of the correct type, avoiding non-string or non-number types where inappropriate.\n- **Callable Errors**: Avoid using non-callable objects as functions, such as 'Position' objects.\n- **Position Unsuitability**: Verify that the target position for the boiler is suitable. Ensure that the terrain and space requirements are met before attempting placement.\n\n### General Errors\n- **Undefined Functions**: Ensure that all functions used, such as 'inspect_terrain', are properly defined and available in the context where they are called."}
