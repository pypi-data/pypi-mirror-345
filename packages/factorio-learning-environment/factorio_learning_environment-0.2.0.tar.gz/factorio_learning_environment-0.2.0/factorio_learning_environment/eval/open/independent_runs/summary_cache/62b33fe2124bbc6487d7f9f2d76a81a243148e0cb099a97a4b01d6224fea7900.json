{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) extracting coal, with a drop position at (52.5, -84.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5) storing extracted coal.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Transport System at Position (-23.0, -68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) extracting copper ore, with a drop position at (-23.5, -69.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (-23.5, -69.5) storing copper ore.\n- Transport Belt network connecting the mining drill to the chest.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) extracting iron ore, with a drop position at (-14.5, -54.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -54.5) storing iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5) transferring iron ore from the chest to another chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-12.5, -54.5) storing transferred iron ore.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-20.0, -70.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -70.0) producing iron plates, currently with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-18.0, -70.0) producing iron plates, currently with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -65.0) producing iron plates, currently with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-20.5, -66.5) waiting for source items to transfer.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-16.5, -64.5) storing iron plates.\n\n### Miscellaneous Storage\n- Wooden Chests at positions (-23.5, -69.5), (-24.5, -67.5), (-20.5, -63.5), (-13.5, -61.5), (1.5, 0.5), and (3.5, 0.5) for storing various resources.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the inserters have access to source items. Check if the source items are available and reachable by the inserters. Adjust the position or supply of source items if necessary.\n\n### Errors when Using Extracting but Being Too Far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when Placing into a Tile Which is Occupied by Another Entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing. Check for existing entities in the target tile and clear them if necessary."}
