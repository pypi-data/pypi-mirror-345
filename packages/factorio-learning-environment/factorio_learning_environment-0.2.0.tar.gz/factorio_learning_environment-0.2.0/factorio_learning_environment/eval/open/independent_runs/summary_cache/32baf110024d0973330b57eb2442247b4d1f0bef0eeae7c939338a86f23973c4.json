{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at position (-15.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -49.0) which is working and producing iron plates.\n\n### Mining and Storage Setup at position (40.0, -84.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (40.0, -84.0) with output directed to a Wooden Chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -83.5) for storing mined resources.\n\n### Transport Belt Network\nConsists of the following belt groups:\n- BeltGroup with inputs at (50.5, -86.5) and outputs at (49.5, -86.5).\n- BeltGroup with inputs at (54.5, -86.5) and outputs at (52.5, -82.5).\n- BeltGroup with inputs at (44.5, -82.5) and outputs at (43.5, -82.5).\n- BeltGroup with inputs at (44.5, -83.5) and outputs at (44.5, -82.5).\n- BeltGroup with inputs at (47.5, -82.5) and outputs at (49.5, -83.5).\n- Individual belts connecting various points in the network.\n\n### Inserter and Chest Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Inserter at position (54.5, -83.5) connected to a transport belt and a Wooden Chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (56.5, -83.5) for storing items from the inserter.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing wooden chests\n- Ensure there is a suitable and unoccupied position before attempting to place a wooden chest.\n\n### TypeError with Position object\n- Verify that you are not trying to call a 'Position' object as a function. Use the correct method or attribute to access position data.\n\n### AttributeError with Prototype\n- Double-check the attribute names in the Prototype class. Use the correct entity names like IronChest, SteelChest, or WoodenChest instead of generic names.\n\n### Exception when inserting items\n- Ensure there is a nearby entity capable of accepting the item you are trying to insert. Check the connectivity and compatibility of entities involved in item transfer.\n\n### Exception when retrieving entities\n- Confirm that the specified entity type exists at the given position before attempting to retrieve it."}
