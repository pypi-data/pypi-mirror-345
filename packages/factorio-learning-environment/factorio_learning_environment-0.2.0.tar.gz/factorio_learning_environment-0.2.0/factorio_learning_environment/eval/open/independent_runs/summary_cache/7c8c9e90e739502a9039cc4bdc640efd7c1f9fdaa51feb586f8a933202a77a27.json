{"content": "I'll create a new report based on the execution logs provided:\n\n# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Smelting Setup (around x=41-45, y=-80 to -82)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0) - actively working, mining coal\n- Storage chest at (41.5, -80.5) - containing 741-760 coal\n- First inserter at (42.5, -80.5) - configured to move items from chest to belt\n- Second inserter at (43.5, -80.5) - configured to move items from belt to furnace\n- Stone furnace at (45.0, -81.0) - currently idle with full fuel (50 coal)\n- Transport belt system at y=-81.5 connecting components\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inventory Management Issues\n- When inventory is full (2850 coal taking up space), cannot:\n  - Pick up entities\n  - Craft new items\n  - Make necessary adjustments to setup\n- Solution: Maintain free inventory slots by storing excess materials in chests or limiting collection amounts\n\n### Entity Placement Issues\n- Attempting to place entities without having them in inventory\n- Solution: Verify item availability before attempting placement\n\n### Inserter Configuration Challenges\n- Multiple attempts needed to correctly align inserters with belts and target positions\n- Solution: Double-check inserter pickup/drop positions when placing, ensure proper direction setting\n\n### Storage Management\n- Chests becoming full (741+ coal) blocking production chain\n- Solution: Implement overflow protection or multiple storage solutions\n\n# NAMESPACE\n\n### Variables\n- None explicitly defined in provided logs\n\n### Functions\n- None explicitly defined in provided logs\n\n### Entity States\n- EntityStatus.WORKING: Used for active mining drills\n- EntityStatus.NORMAL: Used for storage containers\n- EntityStatus.WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS: Used for idle inserters\n- EntityStatus.NO_INGREDIENTS: Used for idle furnaces"}
