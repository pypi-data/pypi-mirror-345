{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) with fuel inventory containing coal. It is currently working but has a warning: \"chest at drop position is full. Empty the chest at (-15.5, -51.5) to continue mining.\"\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-15.5, y=-51.5) containing iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-51.5) with fuel inventory containing coal. It is waiting for source items and is connected to a transport belt.\n- **Transport Belt** connecting the burner inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-51.5) to another belt at position (x=-12.5, y=-51.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with an inventory of iron ore and producing iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=0.5, y=-1.5) with fuel inventory containing coal. It is waiting for source items and connected to a transport belt.\n- **Transport Belt** connecting the burner inserter at position (x=0.5, y=-1.5) to another belt at position (x=0.5, y=-2.5).\n\n### Belt System\n- **BeltGroup** with inputs from position (x=-13.5, y=-51.5) to (x=-11.5, y=-51.5) in the RIGHT direction and outputs from position (x=0.5, y=-3.5) to (x=0.5, y=-1.5) in the DOWN direction. The belt system consists of 75 belts.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items without having them in inventory\n- Ensure that the items you wish to insert are available in your inventory. For example, attempting to insert coal into a mining drill failed due to a lack of coal in the inventory.\n\n### Errors due to full storage\n- Regularly check and empty storage entities like chests to prevent blockages in production. The burner mining drill cannot continue mining as the chest at drop position (-15.5, -51.5) is full.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- **insert_item**: This function is used to insert items into an entity. It failed when attempting to insert coal into the mining drill due to a lack of coal in the inventory.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `mining_drill`: Represents the mining drill entity, used in the context of inserting items.\n- `inventory`: A dictionary representing the current inventory of the agent, including items like wood, coal, stone, iron ore, and iron plates."}
