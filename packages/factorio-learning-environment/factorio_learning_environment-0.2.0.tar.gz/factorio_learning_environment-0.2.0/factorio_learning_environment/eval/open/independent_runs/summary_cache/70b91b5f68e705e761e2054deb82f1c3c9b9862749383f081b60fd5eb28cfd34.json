{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Smelting Station at position(0,0)\nConsists of two stone furnaces for smelting iron plates:\n- Stone furnace at position(0,0)\n- Stone furnace at position(2,0)\nBoth furnaces have coal fuel and are currently idle due to lack of iron ore input.\n\n### Automated Coal Mining Station at position(41,-82)\nAn automated coal mining setup consisting of:\n- Burner mining drill at position(41,-82) mining coal\n- Wooden chest at position(41.5,-80.5) collecting mined coal\n- Burner inserter at position(41.5,-79.5) oriented upward\nThe system is operational with the drill actively mining coal and storing it in the chest.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Collisions\n- Check for existing entities before placing new ones at a location\n- When placing entities next to each other, ensure proper spacing and consider entity dimensions\n- Use appropriate spacing parameters when using place_entity_next_to function\n\n### Inventory Management\n- Ensure required items are in inventory before attempting to craft or place entities\n- Keep track of used materials and maintain sufficient resources for planned constructions\n\n### Transport Belt Issues\n- Verify you have transport belts in inventory before attempting to connect entities\n- When connecting entities with belts, ensure the path is clear and entities are properly spaced\n\n### Entity Insertion Errors\n- Verify you have the required items in inventory before attempting to insert them into entities\n- Check fuel requirements for burner entities before placement\n\n### Crafting Prerequisites\n- Ensure all required ingredients are available before attempting to craft items\n- For items requiring machine crafting or smelting, set up appropriate production facilities first\n\n### Entity Configuration\n- When setting up automated systems, verify correct orientation of inserters and other directional entities\n- Consider the input/output positions of entities when designing automated systems"}
