This will prevent assertion errors when attempting to insert items.\n\n### Inserter Output Blocked\n- Make sure there is a sink entity available to accept items from inserters to avoid blockage warnings. Check that the destination is not occupied or full.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entity has items available for the inserter to pick up. Verify the supply chain to prevent the inserter from waiting indefinitely."}
