{"content": "I see the issue now. Let's analyze what happened:\n\n1. Current State:\n- We have iron plates (4)\n- We have transport belts (39)\n- We have a stone furnace (1)\n- We have coal (25)\n- We have stone (40)\n- We don't have any burner inserters\n\n2. The Error:\n- The assertion failed because we tried to verify we had 2 burner inserters\n- The craft_item() command didn't actually create the burner inserter\n- We're missing iron gear wheels which are needed for the recipe\n\n3. Corrected Approach:\nLet's modify the code to:\n1. First craft iron gear wheels\n2. Then craft the burner inserters\n\n```python\n# Check current inventory\ninventory = inspect_inventory()\nprint(f\"Current inventory: {inventory}\")\n\n# First craft iron gear wheels\nprint(\"Crafting iron gear wheels...\")\ncraft_item(Prototype.IronGearWheel)\n\n# Verify we have the gear wheels\ninventory = inspect_inventory()\nprint(f\"Inventory after crafting gear: {inventory}\")\n\n# Now craft burner inserters\nprint(\"Crafting burner inserters...\")\ncraft_item(Prototype.BurnerInserter)\ncraft_item(Prototype.BurnerInserter)\n\n# Verify final inventory\ninventory = inspect_inventory()\nprint(f\"Final inventory: {inventory}\")\n\n# Verify we have what we need\nif inventory.get(Prototype.BurnerInserter, 0) >= 2:\n    print(\"Successfully crafted burner inserters\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Failed to craft required inserters\")\n```\n\nLessons Learned:\n1. Always check recipe requirements before crafting\n2. Verify intermediate materials are available\n3. Use print statements to track inventory changes\n4. Handle crafting dependencies in the correct order\n5. Use conditional checks instead of assertions for better error handling\n\nTips for Future:\n1. Create a helper function to check recipe requirements\n2. Create a function to craft items with dependencies\n3. Implement inventory checking before attempting builds\n4. Use try/except blocks instead of assertions\n5. Keep track of resource requirements\n\nHere's a helper function we could use in the future:\n\n```python\ndef ensure_craftable(item_prototype, quantity=1):\n    \"\"\"\n    Checks if an item can be crafted and crafts required dependencies\n    Returns True if successful, False if not possible\n    \"\"\"\n    recipe = get_prototype_recipe(item_prototype)\n    inventory = inspect_inventory()\n    \n    # Check each ingredient\n    for ingredient in recipe.ingredients:\n        current_amount = inventory.get(ingredient.name, 0)\n        if current_amount < ingredient.count * quantity:\n            # Try to craft the missing ingredient\n            needed = ingredient.count * quantity - current_amount\n            if not craft_item(ingredient.name, needed):\n                print(f\"Cannot craft {ingredient.name}, missing materials\")\n                return False\n    \n    # Now craft the actual item\n    return craft_item(item_prototype, quantity)\n```\n\nWould you like me to proceed with a revised version of the original automation setup using these improved approaches?", "summary_range": "[1-1378]"}
