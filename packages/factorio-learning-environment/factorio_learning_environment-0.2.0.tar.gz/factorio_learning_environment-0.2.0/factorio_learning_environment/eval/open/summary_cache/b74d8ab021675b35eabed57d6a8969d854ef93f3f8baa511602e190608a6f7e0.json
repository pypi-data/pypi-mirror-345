{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron gear wheel production line at position around (16.0, 71.0) to (21.5, 73.5)\nConsists of the following connected entities forming a production chain for iron gear wheels:\n- Burner mining drill at position (16.0, 71.0) extracting iron ore\n- Stone furnace at position (17.0, 73.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates\n- Burner inserter at position (17.5, 71.5) moving iron ore from the mining drill to the furnace\n- Burner inserter at position (23.5, 73.5) feeding iron plates into the assembling machine\n- Burner inserter at position (19.5, 73.5) taking iron gear wheels from the assembling machine\n- Wooden chest at position (18.5, 73.5) collecting iron gear wheels\n- Assembling machine 2 at position (21.5, 73.5) set to craft iron gear wheels from iron plates\n- Small electric pole at position (21.5, 75.5) providing electricity connections to the assembling machine and inserters\n\nThis structure integrates mining, smelting, assembling, and storage within a compact area, connected by inserters and powered by an electric pole.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to placing assembling machines not in inventory\n- Ensure the correct assembling machine type is available in inventory before attempting placement. For example, trying to place assembling-machine-1 without having it causes failure.\n- Use assembling-machine-2 if assembling-machine-1 is unavailable or adjust inventory accordingly.\n\n### Errors when connecting transport belts directly from furnaces\n- Transport belts cannot be connected directly from stone furnaces as source entities.\n- Always use an inserter to extract items from furnaces before feeding them onto belts.\n\n### Errors placing entities due to collisions or occupied tiles\n- When placing inserters or other entities next to existing structures, check for occupied tiles such as wooden chests or other inserters.\n- Increase spacing, change placement direction, or adjust reference positions to avoid collisions.\n- Be aware of nearby entities like assembling machines blocking placement areas.\n\n### Errors due to assembler not receiving power\n- Even if electric poles are placed and connected, assembling machines may still report no power if connections are incomplete or incorrect.\n- Verify that the electric poles are properly connected to the assembling machine and inserters.\n- Check power availability and pole coverage to ensure the assembler receives electricity.\n\n### General tips to mitigate placement and power errors\n- Before placing entities, confirm the target tile is free and not occupied by any other entity.\n- Confirm inventory contains the required entity type before placement attempts.\n- When connecting belts or inserters, follow the correct entity connection hierarchy (e.g., inserter between furnace and belt).\n- Regularly verify power network connectivity and energy levels of electric entities to avoid production halts.\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nNo user-defined functions have been defined in the current steps."}
