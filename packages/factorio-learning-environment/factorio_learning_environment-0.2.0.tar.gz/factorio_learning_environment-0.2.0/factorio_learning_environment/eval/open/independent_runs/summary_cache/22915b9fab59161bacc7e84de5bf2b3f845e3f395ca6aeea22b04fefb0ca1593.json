{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\n  - Fuel: 1 unit of coal\n  - Status: Working\n  - Warnings: Output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Drop Position: (-16.5, -52.5)\n  - Resources: 40,000 units of iron ore\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-14.0, -49.0)\n  - Fuel: 14 units of coal\n  - Status: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Furnace Result: 60 units of iron plate\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Placing Entities\n- Ensure there is enough space and no obstructions at the desired location before placing entities such as Wooden Chests, Transport Belts, and Burner Inserters.\n- Verify that the target location is not already occupied by another entity to avoid placement errors.\n\n### Errors with Moving Entities\n- Confirm the destination is valid and unoccupied before attempting to move entities like Stone Furnaces to a new location.\n\n### Errors with Entity Retrieval\n- Ensure the entity exists at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it. Double-check the coordinates and ensure the entity type matches the expected type to avoid retrieval errors.\n\n### Output Blockage Warnings\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity or storage available to accept the output from production entities like the Burner Mining Drill to prevent output blockage.\n\n### Ingredient Shortage Warnings\n- Regularly supply necessary ingredients to production entities like Stone Furnaces to avoid warnings about missing ingredients and ensure continuous production."}
