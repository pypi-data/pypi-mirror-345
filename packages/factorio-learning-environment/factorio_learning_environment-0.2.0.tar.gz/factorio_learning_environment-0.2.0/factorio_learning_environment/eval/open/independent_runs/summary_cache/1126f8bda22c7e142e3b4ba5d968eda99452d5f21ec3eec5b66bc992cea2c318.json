{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) with coal as fuel, currently working and connected to:\n- Stone Furnace at position (41.0, -80.0), which is fueled by coal but has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility at Position (-21.0, -73.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-21.0, -73.0) with coal as fuel, currently working but output is blocked due to no sink entity to accept the output, connected to:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -71.0), which is fueled by coal but has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items without having them in inventory\n- Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. For example, attempting to insert coal into a stone furnace without having coal in the inventory resulted in an error.\n\n### Errors due to output blockage\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity or a belt system in place to accept the output from mining drills to prevent blockage. This will ensure continuous operation without interruptions.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `insert_item(item: Prototype, target: Entity, quantity: int)`: Attempts to insert a specified quantity of an item into a target entity.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `stone_furnace`: Represents a stone furnace entity, used in the context of inserting items.\n- `iron_mining_drill`: Represents a burner mining drill entity for iron ore extraction.\n- `copper_mining_drill`: Represents a burner mining drill entity for copper ore extraction."}
