{"content": "To resolve the issue of not having enough Small Electric Poles to complete the connection, let's ensure we have the correct number of poles and place them efficiently. Here's a step-by-step approach:\n\n### Step 1: Calculate and Craft Required Small Electric Poles\n\n1. **Determine Total Poles Needed:**\n   - We need 4 poles in total for the connection.\n   - Check how many poles are already in the inventory and calculate how many more are needed.\n\n2. **Craft Additional Poles:**\n   - Ensure you have enough resources (wood and copper cables) to craft the additional poles.\n\n```python\n# Define the number of poles needed\ntotal_poles_required = 4\n\n# Check current inventory for existing poles\ninventory = inspect_inventory()\nexisting_poles = inventory.get(Prototype.SmallElectricPole, 0)\npoles_needed = total_poles_required - existing_poles\n\n# Ensure sufficient resources for crafting\nwood_required_per_pole = 2\ncopper_cable_required_per_pole = 1\n\navailable_wood = inventory.get(Prototype.Wood, 0)\navailable_copper_cable = inventory.get(Prototype.CopperCable, 0)\n\n# Gather resources if needed\nif available_wood < poles_needed * wood_required_per_pole:\n    additional_wood_needed = poles_needed * wood_required_per_pole - available_wood\n    wood_position = nearest(Resource.Wood)\n    move_to(wood_position)\n    gather_wood = harvest_resource(wood_position, quantity=additional_wood_needed)\n    assert gather_wood >= additional_wood_needed, f\"Insufficient wood gathered. Needed: {additional_wood_needed}, Gathered: {gather_wood}\"\n\nif available_copper_cable < poles_needed * copper_cable_required_per_pole:\n    additional_copper_cable_needed = poles_needed * copper_cable_required_per_pole - available_copper_cable\n    craft_item(Prototype.CopperCable, quantity=additional_copper_cable_needed)\n\n# Craft the additional poles\ncrafted_poles = craft_item(Prototype.SmallElectricPole, quantity=poles_needed)\nassert crafted_poles == poles_needed, f\"Failed to craft required Small Electric Poles. Needed: {poles_needed}, Crafted: {crafted_poles}\"\n```\n\n### Step 2: Place and Connect the Small Electric Poles\n\n1. **Move Closer to Placement Area:**\n   - Ensure the player is within range to place the poles.\n\n2. **Place Poles Efficiently:**\n   - Place the poles in a line or configuration that ensures connectivity to the assembling machine.\n\n3. **Connect the Poles:**\n   - Use the poles to create a power line to the assembling machine.\n\n```python\n# Move to the starting position for placing poles\ntarget_position = Position(x=2.5, y=1.5)\nmove_to(target_position)\n\n# Place the Small Electric Poles\ncurrent_position = target_position\nfor i in range(total_poles_required):\n    placed_pole = place_entity(Prototype.SmallElectricPole, Direction.UP, current_position)\n    assert placed_pole, f\"Failed to place Small Electric Pole {i+1} at position {current_position}.\"\n    # Increment position for the next pole\n    current_position = Position(x=current_position.x + 1.0, y=current_position.y)\n\n# Connect the poles to the assembling machine\nplaced_poles = get_entities({Prototype.SmallElectricPole})\nfor pole in placed_poles:\n    connect_entities(pole, assembling_machine_entity, connection_type=Prototype.SmallElectricPole)\n```\n\n### Step 3: Finalize and Verify\n\n- Insert required materials into the assembling machine.\n- Allow time for operations and verify the setup.\n\n```python\n# Insert materials into the assembling machine\ncopper_plates_quantity = inventory.get(Prototype.CopperPlate, 0)\ninsert_item(Prototype.CopperPlate, assembling_machine_entity, quantity=copper_plates_quantity)\ninsert_item(Prototype.IronPlate, assembling_machine_entity, quantity=5)\n\n# Allow time for operations\nsleep(10)\n\n# Verify and report the final state\nfinal_inventory = inspect_inventory()\nassembling_machine_inventory = inspect_inventory(assembling_machine_entity)\n\nprint(f\"Final Inventory: {final_inventory}\")\nprint(f\"Assembling Machine Inventory: {assembling_machine_inventory}\")\nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")\n```\n\nThis approach ensures that you have enough Small Electric Poles to establish a connection and that they are placed efficiently to power the assembling machine.", "summary_range": "[1-108]"}
