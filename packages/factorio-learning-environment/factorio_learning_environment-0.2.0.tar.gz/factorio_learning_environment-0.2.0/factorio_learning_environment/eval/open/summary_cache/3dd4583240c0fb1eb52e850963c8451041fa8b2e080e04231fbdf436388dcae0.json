{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron ore mining and smelting structure at position around (17.5, 72.5)\nConsists of the following connected entities:\n- Electric mining drill at position (17.5, 72.5) facing down, powered but output blocked due to furnace belt blockage.\n- Stone furnace at position (18.0, 75.0) fueled with coal, working but with full output inventory.\n- Three wooden chests at positions (19.5, 75.5), (21.5, 75.5), and (21.5, 77.5), serving as staged storage for iron plates.\n- Burner inserters at positions (20.5, 75.5) and (20.5, 77.5), both fueled and moving iron plates between furnace and chests.\n- Small electric pole at (15.5, 75.5) connected to power network.\n\nThis structure enables extraction, smelting, and staged storage of iron plates with improved inserter fueling and power connectivity, though output belt blockage persists.\n\n### Steam power generation structure at position around (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, -0.5) extracting water.\n- Boiler at position (-5.0, 2.5) fueled with coal and working.\n- Steam engine at position (0.5, 6.5) connected by pipes to boiler, working and generating power.\n- Small electric poles near boiler (-4.5, -0.5) and steam engine (0.5, 3.5).\n\nThis structure reliably generates electricity from steam power, supplying the factory\u2019s electric network. Pipe connections between boiler and steam engine exist but have encountered connection issues.\n\n### Iron gear wheel assembly structure at position around (25.5, 80.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine 2 at (25.5, 80.5), powered and set to craft iron gear wheels but currently lacking iron plates input.\n- Small electric pole at (25.5, 77.5) connected to power network.\n- Input burner inserter at (20.5, 77.5) feeding into assembly area.\n- Output burner inserter at (25.5, 83.5) fueled and working.\n- Output wooden chest at (25.5, 82.5) receiving assembling machine output.\n- Previous output chest at (25.5, 82.5) was removed and replaced to free space for inserter placement.\n\nThis structure is intended for iron gear wheel production, now powered and with inserters fueled, but still lacks sufficient iron plate input to operate.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity placement conflicts due to occupied tiles\n- Attempt to place pipe at (-6.5, 2.5) failed because tile was occupied by an existing pipe.\n- Previous attempts to place burner inserters and poles near assembling machine and furnace also failed due to occupied tiles.\n- To avoid these errors, always verify tile occupancy before placement.\n- Remove or relocate existing entities blocking placement or adjust placement coordinates and orientation.\n\n### Pipe connection failures between boiler and steam engine\n- Multiple attempts to connect boiler at (-5.0, 2.5) to steam engine at (0.5, 6.5) failed due to no valid fluid connection points.\n- Possible causes include blocked connection points or incorrect pipe placement.\n- Ensure pipe connections are placed on valid connection points of both entities.\n- Verify no entities block pipe connection points and that pipes form a continuous fluid path.\n\n### Inserter fueling and inventory management\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 77.5) and (25.5, 83.5) successfully fueled recently.\n- Previous issues with inserters being out of fuel or having full inventories have been mitigated.\n- Continue monitoring inserter fuel levels and inventories to maintain operation.\n\n### Insufficient input materials for assembling machine\n- Assembling machine at (25.5, 80.5) reports missing iron plates preventing crafting.\n- Input and output inventories of assembling machine remain empty.\n- Ensure sufficient iron plates are delivered to assembling machine input chest to enable production.\n\n### Output blockage and furnace inventory full warnings persist\n- Mining drill at (17.5, 72.5) still reports furnace belt at drop position blocked.\n- Furnace output inventory remains full, preventing further smelting output.\n- Clear output belts and chests to allow continuous item flow from furnace to storage.\n\nNAMESPACE\nNo user-defined functions have been defined by the agent."}
