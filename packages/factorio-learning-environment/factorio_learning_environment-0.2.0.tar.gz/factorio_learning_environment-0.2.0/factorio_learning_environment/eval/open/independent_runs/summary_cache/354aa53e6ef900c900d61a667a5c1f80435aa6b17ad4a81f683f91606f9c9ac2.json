{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nThis facility is responsible for mining copper ore and processing it into copper plates. It consists of:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-23.0, y=-68.0) extracting copper ore, with a **drop position** at (x=-23.5, y=-69.5).\n- **Transport Belt Network** connecting the mining drill to a **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-23.5, y=-69.5) for temporary storage.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-21.0, y=-62.0) for smelting copper ore into copper plates, although currently it has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nThis facility is responsible for mining iron ore and processing it into iron plates. It consists of:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0) extracting iron ore, with a **drop position** at (x=-14.5, y=-54.5).\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-54.5) transferring iron ore from the mining drill to a **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-12.5, y=-54.5).\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates, although currently it has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Coal Mining Facility\nThis facility is responsible for mining coal, which is used as fuel for various entities. It consists of:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=53.0, y=-83.0) extracting coal, with a **drop position** at (x=52.5, y=-84.5).\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=52.5, y=-84.5) for storing mined coal.\n\n### Transport Belt Network\nSeveral **BeltGroups** are present on the map, facilitating the movement of resources between different entities. These include:\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (x=-25.5, y=-70.5) to (x=-23.5, y=-70.5) and (x=-21.5, y=-67.5) to (x=-21.5, y=-69.5).\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (x=-18.5, y=-71.5) to (x=-16.5, y=-71.5).\n- Additional BeltGroups connecting various positions to facilitate resource transport.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Picking Up Non-existent Items\n- Ensure that the item you are trying to pick up exists at the specified position before attempting to pick it up. In this case, there was an attempt to pick up iron ore at position (x=-14.5, y=-54.5) where none was present.\n\n### Attribute Errors in Code\n- When accessing attributes of objects, ensure that the attribute exists. The error occurred when trying to access the 'direction' attribute of a 'BeltGroup' object, which does not have such an attribute.\n\n### Output Blocked by Item on the Ground\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity (such as a chest or belt) to accept the output from mining drills to prevent blockage. The mining drill at position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0) reported an output blockage due to an item on the ground.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that there are source items available for inserters to pick up. The burner inserter at position (x=2.5, y=0.5) is waiting for source items, indicating a potential supply chain issue."}
