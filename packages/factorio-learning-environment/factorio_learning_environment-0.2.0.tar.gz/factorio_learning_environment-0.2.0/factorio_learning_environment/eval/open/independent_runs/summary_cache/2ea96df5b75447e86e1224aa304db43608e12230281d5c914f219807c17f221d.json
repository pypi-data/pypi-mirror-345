{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-12.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Fuel: Coal (6 units)\n  - Warnings: Chest at drop position is full. Empty the chest at (-14.5, -48.5) to continue mining.\n  - Neighbours: Wooden Chest at (-14.5, -48.5), Burner Inserter at (-13.5, -48.5)\n  - Resources: Iron Ore (9997 units)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5)\n  - Inventory: Iron Ore (8 units), Iron Plate (3 units)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Fuel: Coal (15 units)\n  - Furnace Source: Iron Ore (6 units)\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Fuel: Coal (4 units)\n  - Neighbours: Wooden Chest at (-14.5, -48.5), Burner Mining Drill at (-15.0, -50.0), Stone Furnace at (-12.0, -48.0)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Insufficient Fuel\n- Ensure you maintain a sufficient supply of coal in your inventory to refuel all necessary entities such as mining drills, inserters, and furnaces. Regularly check and replenish coal supplies to avoid interruptions in production.\n\n### Errors with Full Inventory\n- Regularly monitor and manage the inventory of chests and other storage entities to prevent them from becoming full. This will ensure continuous operation of mining drills and other production facilities.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Alignment\n- When repositioning and aligning inserters, ensure they are correctly set to transfer resources between the intended entities. Double-check the alignment and functionality to avoid resource transfer issues.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Production\n- Verify that the furnace has both the necessary input materials and fuel to produce iron plates. If production stalls, check for adequate iron ore supply and ensure the furnace is properly fueled."}
