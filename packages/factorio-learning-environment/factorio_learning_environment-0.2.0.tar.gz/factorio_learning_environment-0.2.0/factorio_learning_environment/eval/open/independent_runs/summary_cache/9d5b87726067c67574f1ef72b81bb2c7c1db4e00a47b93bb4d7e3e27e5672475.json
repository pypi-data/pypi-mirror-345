Consider increasing spacing, changing direction, or changing the reference position to avoid collisions with existing entities such as wooden chests or burner mining drills.\n\n### Errors due to distance limitations when placing entities\n- Move closer to the target position before attempting to place an entity. The maximum distance allowed is 10 units, ensure you are within this range to successfully place entities like wooden chests or stone furnaces."}
