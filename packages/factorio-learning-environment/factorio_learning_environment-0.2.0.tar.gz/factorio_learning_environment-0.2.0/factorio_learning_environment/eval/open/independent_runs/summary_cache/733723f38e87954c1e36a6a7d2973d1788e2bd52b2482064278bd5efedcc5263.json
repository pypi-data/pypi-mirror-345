Check the entity's inventory before attempting extraction.\n\n### Errors when Inserting with Insufficient Inventory\n- Before inserting items into a structure, verify that you have the necessary items in your inventory to complete the action.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entities for inserters are producing or have items available for the inserters to move. Check the production chain to ensure continuous flow of materials.\n\n### Errors when Placing into a Tile which is Occupied by Another Entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity onto a tile before attempting placement. Check for existing entities or obstructions in the target tile."}
