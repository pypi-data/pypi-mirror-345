Adjust the position if placement fails.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient inventory items\n- Verify that you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to place or insert items into structures. For example, ensure you have Stone Furnaces in your inventory before attempting to place them, and sufficient iron ore before inserting into furnaces.\n\n### Validation errors for BuildingBox\n- Ensure that the dimensions (height and width) provided for entities like Stone Furnaces are valid integers. Double-check the input values for correctness before proceeding with placement.\n\n### Errors during item insertion\n- Confirm that the inventory has the required items before attempting to insert them into structures. For instance, ensure there is enough iron ore in your inventory before inserting it into furnaces."}
