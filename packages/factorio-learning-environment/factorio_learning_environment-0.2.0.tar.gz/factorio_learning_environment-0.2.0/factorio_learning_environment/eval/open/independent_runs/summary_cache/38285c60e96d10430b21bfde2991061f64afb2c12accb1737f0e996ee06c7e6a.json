{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Setup at (-19.0, -50.0) and (-15.0, -50.0)\nTwo mining stations for iron ore consisting of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-19.0, -50.0) with wooden chest at (-18.5, -48.5)\n- Burner mining drill at (-15.0, -50.0) with wooden chest at (-14.5, -48.5)\nBoth drills are operational and mining iron ore into their respective chests\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line (0.0, 0.0)\nAutomated smelting setup consisting of:\n- Stone furnace at (0.0, 0.0) with burner inserter at (-1.5, 0.5)\n- Input wooden chest at (-2.5, 0.5) feeding iron ore via inserter\n- Stone furnace at (2.0, 0.0) with burner inserter at (3.5, 0.5)\n- Input wooden chest at (4.5, 0.5) feeding iron ore via inserter\nBoth furnaces are operational and smelting iron plates\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with BuildingBox calculations\n- Fix the type error when calculating building box dimensions - ensure proper numeric values are used instead of model attributes\n\n### Resource placement errors\n- Verify resource patches exist in the target area before placing mining drills\n- Check if the target location is clear and suitable for entity placement\n\n### Inventory management errors\n- Ensure required items are in inventory before attempting to place or insert them\n- Craft required items (like wooden chests) before trying to place them\n\n### Distance related errors\n- Move closer to target location when placing entities - maximum placement distance is 10 units\n- Current position vs target position distance must be within placement range\n\n### Entity placement conflicts\n- Check for existing entities before placing new ones\n- Use proper spacing when placing entities next to each other\n- Verify the target position is not occupied by another entity\n\n### API usage errors\n- Use correct argument types when calling API functions (e.g., Entity objects instead of Position objects for insert_item)\n- Follow the API specification for function parameters"}
