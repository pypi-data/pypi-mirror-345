{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining Operation at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5).\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Transport System at Position (-23.0, -68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-23.5, -69.5).\n- A series of transport belts forming a BeltGroup that connects the mining drill to the chest.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing System at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -54.5).\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5) transferring items from the chest to another Wooden Chest at position (-12.5, -54.5).\n- A transport belt connecting the mining drill to the inserter.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-20.0, -70.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -70.0) with a Wooden Chest at position (-20.5, -63.5) for storing iron plates.\n\n### Miscellaneous Storage\n- Multiple Wooden Chests at various positions for storing resources and products.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Undefined or Incorrect Object Attributes\n- Ensure that the correct object types and their attributes are used in the code. For example, a `BeltGroup` object does not have a `prototype` attribute. Verify object types before accessing attributes.\n\n### Errors with Undefined Names\n- Ensure that all variable names and classes are defined before use. For instance, the `Entity` class must be properly imported or defined in the script to avoid `NameError`.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Check that the source items are available for inserters to pick up. Ensure that the source chest is not empty or blocked.\n\n### Furnace Warnings\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt and that their fuel source is not full to prevent warnings like 'no ingredients to smelt' and 'furnace fuel source is full'."}
