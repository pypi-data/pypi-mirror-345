{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nThis structure is responsible for mining iron ore and smelting it into iron plates. It consists of:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) which extracts iron ore and drops it at position (-14.5, -48.5).\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-14.0, -48.0) which receives iron ore from the mining drill and smelts it into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-14.5, -46.5) which transfers iron ore from the mining drill to the furnace.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied tiles\n- Ensure that the tile where you are trying to place a new entity is not already occupied by another entity. Consider increasing the spacing, changing the direction, or adjusting the reference position to avoid collisions.\n\n### Errors due to misalignment of inserters\n- Verify that the inserter's pickup and drop positions are correctly aligned with the mining drill's drop position and the furnace's input position. Misalignment can cause the inserter to malfunction.\n\n### Errors when inserting items without inventory\n- Before attempting to insert items into an entity, ensure that the required items are available in your inventory."}
