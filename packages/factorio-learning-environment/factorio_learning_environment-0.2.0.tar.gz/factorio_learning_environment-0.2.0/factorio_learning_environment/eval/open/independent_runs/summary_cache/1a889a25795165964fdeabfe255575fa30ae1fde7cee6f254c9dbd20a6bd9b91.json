{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position(41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position 41.0, -82.0) with a status of WORKING and currently using coal as fuel.\n- Wooden Chest (position 41.5, -80.5) containing coal, which is used for storing resources extracted by the Burner Mining Drill.\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at position(-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace (position -15.0, -50.0) which is currently in a NO_INGREDIENTS state, indicating it does not have any materials to smelt.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n- **Errors when extracting from a full chest**: The agent received warnings indicating that the chest at (41.5, -80.5) is full. To mitigate this, ensure to regularly empty the chest to allow for continued extraction from the Burner Mining Drill.\n- **Errors when the Burner Mining Drill runs out of fuel**: The Burner Mining Drill reported a status of NO_FUEL. Ensure that there is a sufficient supply of fuel (coal) available for the mining drill to operate continuously.\n- **Errors when using extracting but being too far**: Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- **Utility Functions**: None defined yet.\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `wood`: int\n  - `coal`: int\n  - `iron-ore`: int\n  - `iron-plate`: int\n  - `burner-mining-drill`: Entity\n  - `wooden-chest`: Entity\n  - `furnace`: Entity"}
