Overlapping burner\u2011inserters, misaligned transport belts and nearby obstructed buildable zones (notably near (8.5, 22.5)) are the primary causes.\n  - Recommendation: Manually inspect and clear interfering entities adjacent to the boiler. Reposition or remove excess burner\u2011inserters and belts to open up space or consider relocating the extra steam engine to a less congested area.\n\n\u2022 Burner\u2011Inserter Fuel and Source Item Issues\n  - Multiple burner\u2011inserters report \u201cout of fuel\u201d or \u201cwaiting for source items\u201d, which disrupts the intended resource flow.\n  - Recommendation: Review and optimize fuel delivery routes and ensure proper positioning of inserters relative to their fuel and resource chests to maintain an uninterrupted supply.\n\n\u2022 Connectivity and Fluid System Gaps in the Steam Engine Network\n  - Several steam engines display status warnings such as \u201cnot connected to power network\u201d, \u201cno input liquid\u201d and \u201cno fluid present in connections.\u201d\n  - Recommendation: Verify that the connection points between the boiler, associated pipes and steam engines align correctly. Adjust positions or clear adjacent obstacles to reestablish proper connectivity for both power and fluid systems.\n\n"}
