{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Coal Mining Setup at position (-28.0, -61.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner mining drill** at position (-28.0, -61.0)\n- **Chest** at position (-27.5, -59.5) for storing mined resources\n- **Coal chest** at position (-28.5, -62.5) for storing coal used as fuel\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when inserting coal into the mining drill\n- The agent repeatedly failed to insert coal into the mining drill because there was no coal in the inventory. Ensure the agent has coal in its inventory before attempting to insert it into the mining drill.\n\n#### Errors due to a full chest\n- The mining drill stopped because the chest at (-27.5, -59.5) was full. Empty the chest to allow the mining drill to continue operation.\n\n#### Errors when extracting coal\n- The agent failed to extract coal from the coal chest at (-28.5, -62.5). Ensure the agent is correctly positioned and has the necessary permissions to extract items from the chest.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n#### Utility Functions\n- **extract_coal()**: Attempts to extract coal from the coal chest. Failed due to incorrect positioning or permissions.\n- **insert_coal()**: Attempts to insert coal into the mining drill. Failed due to lack of coal in the agent's inventory.\n- **transfer_coal()**: Attempts to transfer coal between chests. Failed due to inability to extract coal.\n\n#### Important Variables\n- **coal_chest**: Position (-28.5, -62.5), contains 20 coal.\n- **mining_drill**: Position (-28.0, -61.0), status: EntityStatus.NO_FUEL.\n- **chest**: Position (-27.5, -59.5), initially empty but later full."}
