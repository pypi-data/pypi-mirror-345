{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining Complex at position(x=37.0, y=-85.0)\nComplex of mining drills and inserters for coal extraction:\n- Three burner mining drills at positions (41.0,-86.0), (39.0,-85.0), and (37.0,-85.0)\n- Wooden chests at (40.5,-87.5), (39.5,-83.5), and (36.5,-86.5) collecting coal\n- Burner inserters at (35.5,-86.5) and (35.5,-85.5) moving coal between chests\n\n### Iron/Copper Ore Mining at position(x=-28.0, y=-61.0)\nMining setup for iron and copper ore:\n- Burner mining drill at (-28.0,-61.0)\n- Wooden chest at (-27.5,-59.5) collecting ore\n- Burner inserter at (-26.5,-59.5) moving ore\n- Connected to transport belt system\n\n### Iron Mining Complex at position(x=-10.0, y=-59.0)\nSeries of mining drills for iron ore:\n- Three burner mining drills at (-10.0,-59.0), (-8.0,-59.0), and (-6.0,-59.0)\n- Wooden chests at (-9.5,-57.5), (-7.5,-57.5), (-5.5,-57.5)\n- Multiple burner inserters moving ore between components\n- Connected to transport belt system\n\n### Smelting Line at position(x=0.0, y=0.0)\nLarge smelting setup:\n- Four stone furnaces at (0.0,0.0), (2.0,0.0), (4.0,0.0), and (6.0,0.0)\n- Input wooden chests at (0.5,-2.5), (2.5,-2.5), (4.5,-2.5), (6.5,-2.5)\n- Output wooden chests at (0.5,2.5), (2.5,2.5), (4.5,2.5), (6.5,2.5)\n- Multiple burner inserters moving items between chests and furnaces\n- Connected to transport belt system\n\n### Power Generation System at position(x=4.5, y=20.5)\nPower generation setup:\n- Steam engine at (4.5,20.5)\n- Boiler at (-1.5,22.0)\n- Offshore pump at (-3.5,27.5)\n- Connected via pipe system\n- Small electric pole network connecting power to other structures\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Fluid Connection Errors\n- When connecting pipes between steam engines and boilers, ensure proper alignment and valid connection points\n- Check that fluid boxes are properly connected in sequence from offshore pump -> boiler -> steam engine\n\n### Entity Status Issues\n- Ensure fuel (coal) is supplied to burner entities before expecting them to work\n- Monitor chest capacities - full output chests will block production\n\n### Transport Belt Layout\n- Verify belt connections are continuous and properly oriented\n- Ensure inserters have valid pickup and drop-off positions relative to belts\n\n### Power System Setup\n- Steam engines require proper fluid connections to work\n- Verify all components (pump -> boiler -> steam engine) are properly connected in sequence"}
