Regularly transfer excess items to storage to avoid a full inventory.\n\n### Errors in Supplying Furnaces\n- Before attempting to supply iron ore to furnaces, verify that you have the necessary iron ore in your inventory.\n\n### Errors in Extracting from Furnaces\n- Ensure that the furnaces contain the expected items before attempting extraction. Check for any warnings or errors indicating missing ingredients or full output slots.\n\n### Errors in Placing Entities\n- Verify that the target location for placing entities is unoccupied. Consider adjusting the position or spacing if an existing object is in the way."}
