Common issues include attempting to place a Burner Inserter or Wooden Chest at a location that is already occupied or unsuitable.\n\n### Errors when connecting entities\n- When connecting belts, ensure you are not attempting to connect directly from a Prototype.WoodenChest object. Use an inserter to extract items from the chest before connecting belts.\n\n### Errors when extracting items\n- Make sure the target entity contains the items you want to extract. Verify the entity's inventory before attempting extraction to avoid errors such as \"Could not find a valid entity containing iron-ore.\"\n\n### Errors due to lack of resources\n- Ensure you have the necessary resources in your inventory before attempting to insert items into entities, such as coal for a mining drill.\n\n### General Placement Errors\n- Double-check the placement of entities like Burner Inserters and Wooden Chests to ensure they are placed next to the appropriate entities and not in blocked or invalid positions."}
