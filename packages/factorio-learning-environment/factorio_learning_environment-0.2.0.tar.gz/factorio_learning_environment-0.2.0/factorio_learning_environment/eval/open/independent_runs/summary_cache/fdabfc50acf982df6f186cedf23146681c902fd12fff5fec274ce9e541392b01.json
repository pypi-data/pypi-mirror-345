{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nCurrently, there are no structures on the map. All attempts to place entities have failed, and the map remains empty.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- **Cannot place Wooden Chest, Stone Furnace, Inserters, and Output Chest**: Ensure that the target tile for placing an entity is not already occupied by another entity or is otherwise unsuitable for placement. Verify that the placement coordinates are valid and that there is sufficient space for the entity.\n\n### Errors related to movement\n- **Error moving to areas**: Ensure that the position objects are correctly defined and callable. Avoid using incorrect data types or misconfigured objects when specifying positions for movement.\n\n### Errors with API usage\n- **String indices must be integers**: When manipulating strings or data structures, ensure that indices are correctly specified as integers rather than strings. This error suggests a potential misuse of data types in the code.\n\n### Errors with building box size\n- **No viable place to put Prototype.WoodenChest**: Consider decreasing the size of the BuildingBox or using multiple smaller BuildingBoxes to find a suitable placement area. This error indicates that the current building area is too large or improperly configured for the available space on the map."}
