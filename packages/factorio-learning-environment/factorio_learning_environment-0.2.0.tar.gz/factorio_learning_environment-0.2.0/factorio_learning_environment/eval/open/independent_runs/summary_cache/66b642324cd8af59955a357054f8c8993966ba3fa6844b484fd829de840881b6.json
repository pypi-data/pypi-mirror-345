{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report (Steps 56-63)\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at position (14.5, 8.0)\nConsists of:\n- Boiler at (14.5, 8.0) (status: FULL_OUTPUT)\n- Steam engine at (17.5, 8.5) (status: NOT_CONNECTED)\n- Small electric poles at (19.5, 9.5) and (17.5, 11.5)\n- Partial water pipe connection from offshore pumps\n\n### Secondary Boiler at position (14.5, 11.0)\nConsists of:\n- Boiler at (14.5, 11.0) (status: NOT_CONNECTED)\n- No steam engine or proper connections\n\n### New Boiler at position (0.5, -2.0)\nConsists of:\n- Boiler at (0.5, -2.0) (status: NOT_CONNECTED)\n- No steam engine or proper connections\n\n### Oil Processing Complex\nConsists of:\n- Oil refinery at (15.5, 15.5) (status: NO_POWER, recipe: BasicOilProcessing)\n- Pumpjack at (17.5, 40.5) (status: NO_POWER)\n- Partial pipe network for crude oil (status: EMPTY)\n- Missing power connections throughout\n\n### Chemical Plant Complex at position (6.5, 12.5)\nConsists of:\n- Chemical plant (status: NO_POWER, recipe: sulfur)\n- Storage tank at (3.5, 12.5)\n- Small electric poles at (8.5, 10.5), (8.5, 13.5), and (7.5, 14.5)\n- Missing petroleum gas input and power\n\n### Water Pipe Network\nConsists of:\n- Two offshore pumps at (-9.5, -0.5) and (-9.5, -2.5)\n- Extensive pipe network with multiple pipe groups:\n  - Working water pipes (status: FULL_OUTPUT) centered at (-8.5, -2.5)\n  - Empty pipe sections (status: EMPTY) throughout the map\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Persistent Fluid Connection Issues\n- Failed to connect offshore pumps to distant targets (positions: -9.5/-2.5 to 10.5/20.0)\n- Attempted invalid pump-to-pump connections\n- Verify maximum pipe distances and proper alignment\n- Check for obstructions in pipe paths\n\n### Placement Distance Problems\n- Repeated pumpjack placement failures due to distance (17.5,40.5 vs player at 0,0)\n- Move within 10 tiles before placing distant entities\n- Implement distance checks before placement attempts\n\n### Entity Existence Assumptions\n- Attempted to access non-existent chemical plant at (6.5,12.5)\n- Implement existence checks before entity retrieval\n- Maintain updated inventory of placed entities\n\n### Inventory Management Issues\n- Attempted to place offshore pump when none were in inventory\n- Verify item availability before placement attempts\n- Track inventory levels for critical components\n\n### Persistent Issues from Previous Report\n- Placement on occupied tiles (still occurring)\n- Boiler fuel insertion failures (still occurring)\n- Power grid connectivity (still occurring)\n\n### New Issues\n- Offshore pump inventory depletion\n- Implement inventory monitoring system\n- Add production planning for critical components"}
