{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 19.5)\nThis setup is responsible for generating electricity and consists of the following entities:\n- **Steam Engine** at position (-5.5, 19.5)\n- **Boiler** at position (-2.5, 24.0)\n- **Offshore Pump** at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- **PipeGroup** connecting the boiler to the steam engine, with pipes running from positions (-5.5, 16.5) to (-2.5, 22.5)\n- **PipeGroup** connecting the offshore pump to the boiler, with pipes running from positions (-8.5, 23.5) to (-4.5, 24.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Undefined Variables and Incorrect References\n- Ensure all variables are defined before use. For example, `steam_engine_buildable_area` was not defined before being used.\n- Double-check variable names and ensure they match the intended references to avoid `NameError`.\n\n### Type Errors in Calculations\n- When performing operations, ensure that the operands are of compatible types. For instance, attempting to add an integer to a `ModelPrivateAttr` resulted in a `TypeError`.\n\n### Crafting and Inventory Management\n- Verify that all required ingredients are available in the inventory before attempting to craft items. The agent attempted to craft items without having the necessary resources, such as iron plates and iron gear wheels.\n- Ensure that crafting operations are performed in the correct environment, such as using a crafting machine or furnace when required.\n\n### Placement and Connection Issues\n- Before placing entities, ensure that they are available in the inventory. An attempt was made to place a steam engine without having it in the inventory.\n- When connecting entities, ensure that all necessary items, such as pipes, are available in the inventory to avoid connection failures.\n\n### Resource Management\n- Regularly check the inventory to ensure that there are sufficient resources for planned operations, such as coal for fueling furnaces and boilers.\n- Plan resource harvesting and insertion operations to maintain a steady supply of necessary materials.\n\nBy addressing these issues, the agent can improve its efficiency and effectiveness in managing resources and constructing structures within the game."}
