{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Offshore Pump at position(-67.5, -98.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump (position -67.5, -98.5) supplying water to the Boiler (position 0.5, -62.0)\n- Connected to Boiler (position 0.5, -62.0) via pipe\n\n### Boiler at position(0.5, -62.0)\nConsists of:\n- Boiler (position 0.5, -62.0) connected to Offshore Pump (position -67.5, -98.5) for water supply\n- Outputs steam for further use\n\n### Furnace at position(4.0, -62.0)\nConsists of:\n- Furnace (position 4.0, -62.0) currently has coal as fuel but no ingredients to smelt\n\n### Lab at position(0.5, 2.5)\nConsists of:\n- Lab (position 0.5, 2.5) connected to Small Electric Pole (position 0.5, -60.5) for power supply\n\n### PipeGroup\nConsists of:\n- A series of pipes forming a fluid system (position coordinates omitted for brevity) connecting the Offshore Pump and Boiler\n\n### Electricity Group\nConsists of:\n- Small Electric Poles providing power to various entities (position coordinates omitted for brevity)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors with power connections\n- Check that all entities requiring power are properly connected to a power source. In this case, the Lab is not receiving power; verify connections to the Small Electric Pole."}
