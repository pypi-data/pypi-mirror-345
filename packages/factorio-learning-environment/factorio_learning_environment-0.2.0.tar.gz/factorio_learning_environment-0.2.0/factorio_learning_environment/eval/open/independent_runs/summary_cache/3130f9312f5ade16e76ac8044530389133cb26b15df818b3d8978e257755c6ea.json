{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nThis facility is responsible for producing iron plates from iron ore. It consists of the following entities:\n\n- **Mining Drill and Chest Setup:**\n  - Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) with sufficient fuel, extracting iron ore.\n  - Wooden Chest at position (x=-15.5, y=-48.5) and another at (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) for storing extracted iron ore.\n\n- **Ore Transfer System:**\n  - Burner Inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnaces.\n\n- **Furnace Setup:**\n  - Stone Furnace at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0) with sufficient fuel, producing iron plates.\n  - Stone Furnace at position (x=-10.0, y=-48.0) with sufficient fuel, producing iron plates.\n\n- **Output System:**\n  - Wooden Chest at position (x=-7.5, y=-47.5) for storing produced iron plates.\n  - Burner Inserter at position (x=-8.5, y=-47.5) transferring iron plates from the furnaces to the output chest.\n\n### Inventory Management System\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-46.5) containing iron ore for continuous supply to the furnaces.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5) managing the transfer of iron ore from the storage chest to the furnaces.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source chest or entity has items available for the inserter to transfer. Regularly check and replenish resources as necessary.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Space in Destination\n- Make sure the destination entity, such as a chest or furnace, has enough space to accommodate incoming items from the inserter.\n\n### Source Empty Errors\n- Monitor resource levels in source chests or entities and replenish them before they run out to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Inserter Blockage Due to Full Destination\n- Regularly clear out items from destination chests or entities to prevent inserters from being blocked due to lack of space."}
