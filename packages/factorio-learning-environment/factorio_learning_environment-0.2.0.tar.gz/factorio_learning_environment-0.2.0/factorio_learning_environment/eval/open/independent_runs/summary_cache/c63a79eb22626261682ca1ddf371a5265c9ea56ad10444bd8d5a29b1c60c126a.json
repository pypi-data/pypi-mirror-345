{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (15.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (15.0, 0.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Inserters at positions (16.5, 0.5) and (17.5, 0.5) connected to the power network, responsible for transferring items.\n\n### Coal-Powered Boiler System at Position (-5.5, 25.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Boiler at position (-5.5, 25.0) fueled by coal, intended to produce steam for power generation.\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5) to supply water to the boiler.\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pump to the boiler, with pipes at positions (-9.5, 23.5), (-8.5, 23.5), and (-7.5, 23.5).\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of:\n- Small Electric Poles at various positions, including (17.5, -0.5) and (1.5, 25.5), to distribute electricity to connected entities like inserters.\n\n### Storage System\nConsists of:\n- Wooden Chest at position (5.5, 0.5) storing iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (18.5, 0.5) for additional storage.\n\n### Steam Engine at Position (-0.5, 25.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (-0.5, 25.5), intended to generate electricity from steam.\n- Pipe connections to facilitate steam flow.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Pipe Connections\n- Ensure that pipes and underground pipes are correctly aligned and connected. Check for any existing entities at the target positions before placing new pipes.\n- Verify that all necessary components, such as pipe-to-ground, are available in the inventory before attempting to connect them.\n\n### Boiler Not Connected\n- Ensure that the boiler is properly connected to both the water supply and the steam engine to function correctly.\n\n### Inserter Power Issues\n- Check that all inserters are connected to a power source and receiving electricity. Ensure that the electricity network is complete and functional.\n\n### Furnace Output Full\n- Regularly extract iron plates from the furnace to prevent it from becoming full and halting production."}
