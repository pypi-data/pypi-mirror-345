{"content": "## Report\n\n### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-14.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) with coal fuel and iron ore input.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-12.0, -48.0) with coal fuel and iron ore input.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -47.5) waiting for source items, connected to the furnaces.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-13.5, -46.5) for storage.\n- Transport Belts connecting the furnaces and chests.\n\n#### Iron Plate Storage and Distribution System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (-13.5, -44.5) storing iron plates.\n- Iron Chest at position (-11.5, -44.5) storing iron plates.\n- Burner Inserters at positions (-14.5, -45.5), (-13.5, -45.5), (-11.5, -45.5), and (-9.5, -44.5) for moving items between belts and chests.\n- Transport Belts connecting the chests and inserters.\n\n#### Electricity Generator at Position (-7.0, 23.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Boiler at position (-7.0, 23.5) with no fuel.\n- Steam Engine at position (-3.5, 23.5) not connected to fluid.\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5) supplying water.\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors in Extracting Items\n- Ensure the target chest has the required items before attempting to extract. Check the inventory of the chest to confirm availability.\n\n#### Errors in Inserting Items\n- Verify that the inventory contains the items you intend to insert. Attempting to insert items not present in the inventory will result in an error.\n\n#### Inventory Management Errors\n- Regularly check the inventory capacity to prevent it from becoming full. A full inventory will block further harvesting or item collection activities.\n\n#### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that source items are available for inserters to pick up. If inserters are waiting, check the connected entities for item availability.\n\n#### Fuel Management for Boilers\n- Keep track of fuel levels in boilers to prevent them from running out of fuel, which will halt electricity production."}
