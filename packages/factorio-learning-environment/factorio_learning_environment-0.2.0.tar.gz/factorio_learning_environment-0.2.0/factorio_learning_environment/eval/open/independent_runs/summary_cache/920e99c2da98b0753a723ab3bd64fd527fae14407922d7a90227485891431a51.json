{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0), fueled with coal, extracting iron ore. The drill is connected to:\n  - **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5), storing extracted iron ore.\n  - **Wooden Chest** at position (-15.5, -48.5), providing additional storage capacity.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-14.5, -47.5), transferring items between the chests.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0), fueled with coal, intended for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when extracting items from non-existent entities\n- Ensure the target entity exists and contains the items you intend to extract before attempting the extraction.\n\n### Errors when placing entities into occupied tiles\n- Verify that the target tile is unoccupied before placing a new entity. Consider adjusting the spacing, direction, or reference position to avoid collisions.\n\n### Errors due to full storage\n- Regularly check and manage inventory space in chests to prevent mining operations from halting due to full storage.\n\n### Errors when placing entities with incorrect spacing or direction\n- Adjust the spacing and direction parameters when placing entities to ensure they do not overlap with existing structures."}
