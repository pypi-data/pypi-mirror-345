{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-16.0, -51.0) with a drop position at (-16.5, -52.5), currently working and extracting iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0), fueled with coal and actively producing iron plates from iron ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to place them. For example, attempting to place a burner-mining-drill without having one in the inventory will result in an error.\n- Check that the desired location for placing entities is not already occupied by another object or entity. This applies to placing Wooden Chests, Transport Belts, and Burner Inserters.\n\n### Errors with furnace setup\n- Verify the setup of the furnace to ensure it is correctly configured to produce iron plates. If the furnace is not producing, check the input materials and fuel availability.\n\n### General Placement Errors\n- Before placing any entity, ensure the location is valid and unoccupied to avoid placement errors. This includes checking for obstacles and ensuring the area is clear."}
