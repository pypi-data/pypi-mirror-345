{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-40.5, -113.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (-40.5, -113.5)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\n- Pipe Network connecting various positions around (-40.5, -113.5) to (-38.5, -111.5)\n- Small Electric Pole at Position (-39.5, -116.5)\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-15.0, -76.0) with a Wooden Chest at Position (-15.5, -77.5)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-19.0, -73.0)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5)\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) connected to Small Electric Poles at Positions (5.5, -60.5) and (7.5, -60.5)\n\n### Laboratory Setup\nConsists of:\n- Lab with input of automation-science-pack at Position (not specified)\n- Small Electric Pole connected to the lab\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- Multiple Pipe Groups at various positions, including:\n  - PipeGroup at Position (-43.5, -120.5)\n  - PipeGroup at Position (-1.5, 11.5)\n  - PipeGroup at Position (-0.5, 17.5)\n  - PipeGroup at Position (-12.5, 23.5)\n  - PipeGroup at Position (-4.5, 24.5)\n  - PipeGroup at Position (1.5, 24.5)\n  - PipeGroup at Position (2.5, 25.5)\n\n### Electricity Network\n- Electricity Group with poles at various positions, including (18.5, -46.5), (1.5, -44.5), (9.5, -44.5), and others.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Pipe Connections\n- Ensure there are no placement blockages before attempting to connect pipes. Check the surrounding area for any obstructions.\n\n### Errors with Small Electric Pole Connections\n- Verify that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to connect entities. Ensure that Small Electric Poles are available.\n\n### Errors when Inserting Items into Entities\n- Confirm that the items you intend to insert are present in your inventory. In this case, ensure coal is available before attempting to insert it into drills or furnaces.\n\n### Errors with Power Supply\n- Ensure that all entities requiring power are connected to the electricity network and that the network is active. Check connections and power availability for inserters and labs."}
