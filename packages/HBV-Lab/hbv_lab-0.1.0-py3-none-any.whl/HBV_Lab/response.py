    """
    Groundwater response routine for HBV-light model with three flow components.
    
    Based on the HBV structure 
    
    Parameters:
    -----------
    out_to_response : float
        Water from soil routine (recharge + surface runoff) (mm/day).
    upper_storage : float
        Current storage in the upper zone reservoir (SUZ) (mm).
    lower_storage : float
        Current storage in the lower zone reservoir (SLZ) (mm).
    params : dict
        Model parameters:
            - 'K0' : Recession coefficient for quick flow (upper zone above threshold) [day^-1].
            - 'K1' : Recession coefficient for intermediate flow (upper zone) [day^-1].
            - 'K2' : Recession coefficient for baseflow (lower zone) [day^-1].
            - 'UZL' : Threshold parameter for upper zone [mm].
            - 'PERC' : Percolation rate from upper to lower zone (mm/day).
    
    Returns:
    --------
    upper_storage : float
        Updated upper zone storage (mm).
    lower_storage : float
        Updated lower zone storage (mm).
    discharge : float
        Total discharge (fast + intermediate + slow runoff) (mm/day).
    quick_flow : float
        Quick flow component from upper zone (above threshold).
    intermediate_flow : float
        Intermediate flow component from upper zone.
    baseflow : float
        Baseflow component from lower zone.
