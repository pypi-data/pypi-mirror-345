Tip: Verify that the fluid_system identifier being used corresponds to an available pipe group within the designated search area.\n- Inconsistent Fluid System References:\n  Connection attempts were made using identifiers that differ from the finalized configuration (the pipeline network now uses fluid_system 123715 for connected components). Tip: Maintain consistency by updating all fluid_system references to match the current entity configuration."}
