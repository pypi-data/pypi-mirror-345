{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-4.5, 22.5) and (-1.5, 22.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (-4.5, 22.5) and (-1.5, 22.5)\n- Boilers at positions (-14.5, 20.0) and (-11.5, 20.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-10.5, 25.5)\n- Pipe connections between boilers and steam engines, though currently facing connection issues\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnaces at positions (-14.0, -49.0) and (-12.0, -48.0)\n- Burner Inserters at positions (-13.5, -47.5) and (-14.5, -45.5)\n- Wooden Chests at positions (-13.5, -46.5) and (-13.5, -44.5)\n- Iron Chest at position (-11.5, -44.5)\n- Belt Group connecting furnaces and chests\n\n### Transport and Storage System\nConsists of:\n- Multiple Burner Inserters and Chests for item transfer\n- Belt Groups for item transportation across various positions\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Pipe Connections\n- Ensure that the pipes and underground pipes are correctly aligned and connected between the boilers and steam engines. Check for any obstructions or misalignments that may prevent successful connections.\n\n### Errors in Repositioning Steam Engines\n- When repositioning steam engines, ensure that the new positions allow for proper alignment and connection with the existing infrastructure. Verify that the repositioned engines can connect to the power network and receive the necessary fluid inputs.\n\n### Errors in Using Undefined Functions\n- Avoid using undefined functions such as 'shift_entity'. Ensure that all functions and methods used are correctly defined and available in the current context.\n\n### Errors in Inventory Management\n- Regularly check and manage inventory to ensure sufficient resources are available for crafting and construction tasks. Ensure that chests are not full to prevent bottlenecks in production."}
