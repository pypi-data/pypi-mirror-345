Before attempting a belt connection, verify the target\u2019s type and, if necessary, place an appropriate inserter to serve as the proper input.\n\u2022 When placing entities (e.g. wooden chests), ensure that the player is within the allowed placement range. Check that the distance between the player\u2019s current position and the target position does not exceed the maximum permitted distance.\n\u2022 Confirm that required items (such as a wooden chest) are available in the inventory before placing them.\n\u2022 Validate all variable names and references (for instance, avoid undefined names like \u201ctarget_chest\u201d) to prevent NameErrors and ensure proper code referencing.\n\n"}
