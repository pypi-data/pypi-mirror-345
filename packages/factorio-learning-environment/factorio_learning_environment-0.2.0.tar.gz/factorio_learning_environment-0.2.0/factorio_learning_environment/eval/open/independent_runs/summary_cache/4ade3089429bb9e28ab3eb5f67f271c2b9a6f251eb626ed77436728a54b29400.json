{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo new structures have been successfully placed on the map during these steps. Although pre\u2010existing smelting furnaces were utilized for resource conversion (an iron furnace at Position(x=5.0, y=5.0) and a copper furnace at Position(x=-27.0, y=-60.0)), no additional buildings\u2014such as the intended Lab at Position(x=0.5, y=2.5)\u2014were created or modified.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 API Usage for Entity Retrieval  \n  \u2013 When invoking get_entities, use the correct signature. In one case a keyword argument (radius) was not accepted and later the function was called with multiple positional arguments. Confirm the API specification before use.\n\n\u2022 Lab Placement and Existence Checks  \n  \u2013 Before attempting to place a Lab at Position(x=0.5, y=2.5), verify that a Lab is available in inventory.  \n  \u2013 When filtering retrieved entities, ensure that a valid iterable is returned (e.g. use fallback defaults if the retrieval function returns None).\n\n\u2022 Lab Crafting Ingredient Shortages  \n  \u2013 Several lab crafting attempts failed due to missing sub-ingredients (such as iron-gear-wheel, electronic-circuit, and copper-cable). Ensure that all required intermediate items are producible or available before initiating Lab crafting.  \n  \u2013 Verify and complete the entire dependency chain (including prior smelting and intermediate crafting steps) to satisfy the lab recipe requirements."}
