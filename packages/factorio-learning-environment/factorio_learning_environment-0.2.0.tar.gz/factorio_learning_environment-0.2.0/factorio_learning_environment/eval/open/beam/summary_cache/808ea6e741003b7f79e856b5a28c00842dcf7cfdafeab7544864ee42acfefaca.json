It seems that the crafting system requires the stone to be in a specific state or quantity that I haven't satisfied yet.\n\n### Tips to Avoid This Error in the Future:\n\n1. **Check Crafting Recipes**: Always verify the crafting recipe for the item you want to create. Ensure you have all necessary resources, including any intermediate products.\n\n2. **Gathering Resources**: If a resource is a raw material, make sure to gather enough of it before attempting to craft. In this case, I should have checked if I needed more stone or if it needed to be processed in any way.\n\n3. **Inspect Inventory**: After gathering resources, inspect the inventory to confirm that the required quantities are present and in the correct form.\n\n4. **Crafting Dependencies**: Understand the dependencies of the items you want to craft. If an item requires other items to be crafted first, ensure those are available.\n\n### Next Steps:\n\nSince I have 3 stone, I will check the crafting recipe for the Stone Furnace to ensure I have everything needed and then proceed to craft it. \n\nLet's check the recipe for the Stone Furnace to confirm its requirements.", "summary_range": "[1-8]"}
