{"content": "# Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Wooden chest at position (4.5, 22.5)\nConsists of:\n- Wooden chest (position 4.5, 22.5) for storing resources.\n\n### Stone furnace at position (61.0, -54.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace (position 61.0, -54.0) for smelting ores.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when attempting to harvest resources\n- Ensure that you are within reach of the resource you want to harvest before attempting to do so.\n\n### Errors when inserting into the stone furnace\n- Make sure that the stone furnace has the necessary ingredients to smelt. Check both fuel and raw materials before inserting.\n- Verify that the stone furnace is not full before attempting to insert items. The inventory capacity of the furnace may be reached.\n\n### Errors related to setting recipes\n- Ensure that the entity you are trying to set the recipe for exists and is correctly referenced. Double-check the entity's status and position before attempting to set a recipe.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when extracting from the wooden chest\n- Ensure that the wooden chest contains the items you want to extract before attempting to extract them. Check the inventory of the chest to confirm availability.\n\n### Errors when extracting from the stone furnace\n- Verify that the stone furnace contains the items you want to extract. If the furnace is empty or has no valid items, the extraction will fail.\n- Ensure that the stone furnace is valid and operational before attempting to extract items.\n\n### Errors when extracting from the stone furnace due to invalid entity\n- Ensure that the stone furnace is valid and contains iron ore before attempting to extract. If the furnace has no valid items or is not found, the extraction will fail.\n\n### Errors when setting recipe for the stone furnace\n- Ensure that the stone furnace is valid and operational before attempting to set a recipe. If the furnace is not found or has no ingredients, the operation will fail.\n\n### Errors related to inserting items into entities\n- Ensure that the second argument in the insert_item function is a valid Entity or EntityGroup, not just a Position. Double-check the parameters being passed to the function to avoid assertion errors.\n\n### Errors when using invalid prototype in function\n- Ensure that the first argument in functions expecting an Entity or Position is indeed an Entity or Position object, not a Prototype enum. Double-check the arguments being passed to avoid ValueErrors."}
