{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System (Incomplete/In Progress)\nLocated near position (-6.0, 24.5), consists of:\n- Boiler at (-6.0, 24.5) facing right, currently not connected and without fuel\n- Offshore pump at (-7.5, 25.5) facing up, currently not connected\n\n### Manufacturing Area\nLocated around (0,0), consists of:\n- Four stone furnaces at:\n  - (0.0, 0.0) with 17 coal\n  - (2.0, 0.0) with 18 coal\n  - (5.0, 0.0) without fuel\n  - (8.0, 0.0) with 8 coal\n\n### Automation Science Pack Production Line\nLocated around (11.5, 1.5), consists of:\n- Input chest at (8.5, 1.5) containing iron plates, copper plates and iron gear wheels\n- Inserter at (9.5, 1.5) moving items from input chest\n- Assembling machine at (11.5, 1.5) crafting automation science packs\n- Output inserter at (13.5, 1.5)\n- Output chest at (14.5, 1.5) containing automation science packs\n\n### Research Area\nMultiple labs connected to electricity group 41555, currently without power:\n- Several labs with varying amounts of automation science packs:\n  - One lab with 56 packs\n  - One lab with 110 packs\n  - One lab with 31 packs\n  - Multiple empty labs\n\n### Transport System\nMultiple belt groups:\n- Belt system from (4.5, 2.5) to (2.5, 2.5)\n- Belt system from (6.5, 2.5) to (4.5, 2.5)\n- Long belt system from (7.5, 3.5) to (-4.5, 19.5)\n- Belt system from (1.5, 5.5) to (1.5, 11.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Errors\n- Cannot place entities that overlap with water tiles\n- Ensure target position is within reach (max distance is 10 tiles from player position)\n- Move closer to target location before attempting to place entities\n\n### Power System Issues\n- Ensure all components (boiler, offshore pump, steam engine) are properly connected\n- Power network components need to be connected to function\n- Verify correct orientation of power system components\n\n### Resource/Fuel Issues\n- Verify fuel (coal/stone) is in inventory before attempting to insert\n- Ensure you are close enough to target entity when inserting fuel\n- Check if target entity can accept the type of fuel you're trying to insert\n\n### Connection Issues\n- Components marked as \"NOT_CONNECTED\" need proper fluid connections\n- Verify connection points between components are properly aligned\n- Ensure proper orientation of components to allow connections"}
