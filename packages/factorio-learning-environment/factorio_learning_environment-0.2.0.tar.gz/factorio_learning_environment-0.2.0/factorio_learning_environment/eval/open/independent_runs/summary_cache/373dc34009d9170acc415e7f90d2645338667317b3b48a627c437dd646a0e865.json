{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\nThere are no existing structures on the map as no entities have been created yet.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n- Ensure you have the necessary resources in your inventory before attempting to craft entities. In this case, there were not enough resources to craft a Stone Furnace.\n- Always check your inventory for required items before executing crafting actions to avoid running into resource shortages.\n- If an assertion error occurs indicating a lack of items, verify your inventory and ensure you have the necessary components before proceeding with actions that depend on those items.\n- When attempting to craft items that require sub-ingredients (e.g., Iron Gear Wheel requires Iron Plate), ensure you have the means to produce those sub-ingredients, such as a furnace or crafting machine."}
