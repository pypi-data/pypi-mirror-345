{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (52.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (52.0, -82.0) extracting coal, with a drop position at (52.5, -80.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (53.5, -80.5) receiving coal from the mining drill.\n- Burner Inserter at position (52.5, -79.5) transferring coal from the chest at (53.5, -80.5) to another chest at (52.5, -78.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -78.5) storing coal.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-12.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-12.0, -51.0) extracting iron ore, with a drop position at (-11.5, -49.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (-11.5, -49.5) receiving iron ore from the mining drill.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) processing iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-11.5, -48.5) transferring iron ore from the chest at (-11.5, -49.5) to the stone furnace.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-8.5, -48.5) waiting for source items.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -46.5) waiting for source items, connected to a chest at (-13.5, -45.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Multiple inserters at positions (52.5, -79.5), (52.5, -76.5), (-11.5, -48.5), (-8.5, -48.5), and (-13.5, -46.5) are waiting for source items. Ensure that the source entities are providing items and that there are no blockages or missing items in the supply chain.\n\n### Chest Full Warning\n- The chest at position (-11.5, -49.5) is full, preventing further mining. Regularly check and empty full chests to maintain continuous mining operations.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions**: No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided steps.\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `wooden-chest`: int = 3\n  - `wood`: int = 10\n  - `coal`: int = 565\n  - `iron-ore`: int = 1134\n  - `iron-plate`: int = 1165\n\nEnsure to address the waiting inserters and full chest warnings to optimize the workflow and prevent resource bottlenecks."}
