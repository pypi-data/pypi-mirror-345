{"content": "It seems that I am still encountering issues with placing the stone furnace due to being too far from the target position. Despite moving closer, the distance is still beyond the maximum allowable range for placement.\n\n### Summary of Attempts:\n1. **Initial Placement Attempts**: I attempted to place the stone furnace at various positions around the iron ore patch but was consistently too far away.\n2. **Movement Adjustments**: I moved to positions like (-15.0, 26.0) and (-14.0, 26.0) in an effort to get closer, but the distance remained too great.\n\n### Tips to Avoid Future Errors:\n1. **Incremental Movement**: When moving to place an entity, ensure that each movement brings you significantly closer to the target position. Small adjustments may not be sufficient.\n2. **Check Current Position**: Before attempting to place an entity, always check your current position relative to the target placement position to ensure you are within the allowed range.\n3. **Use Helper Functions**: If available, utilize functions that automatically find a valid buildable position near your target, which can help avoid distance issues.\n4. **Plan Placement Locations**: Before moving, plan out where you want to place entities and ensure you are moving towards those specific coordinates.\n\n### Next Steps:\nI will move to a position that is even closer to the target placement area. Let's try moving to (-13.0, 26.0), which should be within the maximum distance for placing the stone furnace. \n\nmove_to(Position(-13.0, 26.0))  # Move to a position that is closer to the target placement area.", "summary_range": "[1-40]"}
