{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=-3.5, y=26.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Steam Engine** at position (x=5.5, y=26.5)\n- **Boiler** at position (x=-3.5, y=26.0)\n- **Offshore Pump** at position (x=-7.5, y=25.5)\n- **Pipe Network** connecting the boiler and steam engine, with pipes at positions (x=-8.5, y=24.5), (x=-7.5, y=24.5), (x=-6.5, y=24.5), and others forming a continuous path.\n\n### Water Supply System\n- **Offshore Pump** at position (x=-11.5, y=26.5)\n- **Pipe Group** at position (x=-10.5, y=25.5) ensuring water flow to the boiler.\n\n### Electricity Network\n- **Small Electric Pole** connected to the steam engine at position (x=5.5, y=24.5)\n- **Electricity Group** with poles distributed across various positions, including (x=26.5, y=17.5), (x=30.5, y=17.5), (x=20.5, y=19.5), providing power distribution.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Entities\n- **Failed to Connect Pipes**: Ensure that there is a clear and unobstructed path between entities when connecting them with pipes. Verify that the positions are correctly aligned and that there are no missing segments in the pipe network.\n\n### Errors Due to Out of Fuel\n- **Boiler Out of Fuel**: Regularly check fuel levels in boilers and ensure they are refueled promptly to maintain continuous operation.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- **connect_entities**: Used to connect two entities with pipes. Ensure that both entities exist and are correctly positioned to allow a connection.\n\n### Important Variables\n- **pipes**: List of pipe positions used to connect entities.\n- **existing_boiler**: Reference to the boiler entity at position (x=-3.5, y=26.0).\n- **Prototype.SteamEngine**: Reference to the steam engine prototype for entity creation.\n- **Prototype.Pipe**: Reference to the pipe prototype for entity creation."}
