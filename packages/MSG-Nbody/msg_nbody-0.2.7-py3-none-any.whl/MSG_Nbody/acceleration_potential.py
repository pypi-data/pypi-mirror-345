    '''
    Computes the gravitational acceleration and potential for each particle due
    to all others using softened Newtonian gravity. The interactions are
    processed in blocks of size `block_size` to improve performance
    Parameters
    ----------
    pos: np.ndarray[np.float64]
        Nx3 array containing the [x, y, z] positions of all particles
    mass: np.ndarray[np.float64]
        Nx1 array containing the mass of each particle
    accel: np.ndarray[np.float64]
        Nx3 array to store the computed gravitational acceleration [ax, ay, az]
        for each particle
    potential: np.ndarray[np.float64]
        Nx1 array to store the computed gravitational potential phi for each
        particle
    softening_sq: float
        square of softening length to prevent division by zero and to define the
        simulation resolution
        sqrt(softening_sq) defines the smallest resolvable scale of interaction
    N: int
        number of particles in simulation
    block_size: int, optional
        size of the blocks used for batch processing of interactions.
        if N < block_size, the algorithm degrades to processing the
        interactions in one calculation. by default, block_size = 3000
    Returns
    -------
    accel: np.ndarray[np.float64]
        Nx3 array of the computed gravitational acceleration [ax, ay, az] for
        each particle
    potential: np.ndarray[np.float64]
        Nx1 array of the gravitational potential experienced by each particle
        due to all other particles
