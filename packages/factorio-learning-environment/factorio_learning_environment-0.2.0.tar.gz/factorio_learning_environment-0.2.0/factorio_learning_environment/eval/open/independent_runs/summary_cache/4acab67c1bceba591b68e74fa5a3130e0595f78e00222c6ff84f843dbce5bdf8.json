{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Two stone furnaces at positions (x=61.0, y=-54.0) and (x=64.0, y=-53.0) supplied with iron ore.\n- Two burner inserters at positions (x=62.5, y=-53.5) and (x=65.5, y=-52.5) for inserting iron ore into the furnaces.\n- A wooden chest at position (x=61.5, y=-52.5) used for storing materials.\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0) extracting coal.\n- Wooden chest at position (x=40.5, y=-83.5) storing extracted coal.\n- Transport belts connecting the mining drill to the chest.\n\n### Additional Storage\n- Wooden chest at position (x=44.5, y=-83.5) used for storing coal and iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inventory Management Errors\n- Ensure there is enough space in the inventory before attempting to craft or harvest items. Consider using chests to offload excess items.\n\n### Belt Connection Errors\n- Verify that the path for transport belts is clear and valid before attempting to connect segments. Ensure that the destination is reachable and not obstructed.\n\n### Inserter and Furnace Supply Errors\n- Ensure that there are sufficient resources available in the inventory before attempting to supply furnaces or inserters. Regularly check and replenish resources as needed.\n\n### Output Blockage Errors\n- Regularly clear the output of machines and chests to prevent blockages. Ensure that there is a clear path for items to be transported away from production facilities.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the current inventory of the player, including items like 'wooden-chest', 'transport-belt', 'burner-inserter', 'coal', 'iron-plate', and 'iron-gear-wheel'.\n- `entities_on_map`: List[Entity] - Represents the entities currently placed on the map, including their positions and statuses."}
