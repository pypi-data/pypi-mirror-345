{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Factory at position(0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Furnace at position (2.0, 0.0)\n- Furnace at position (4.0, 0.0)\n- Furnace at position (6.0, 0.0)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n- **Errors when inserting items into a full inventory**\n  - Ensure that the target entity's inventory is not full before attempting to insert items. Check the inventory capacity and current items before insertion.\n  \n- **Errors when not having enough resources**\n  - Regularly check your inventory to ensure you have sufficient resources (like iron ore) before trying to insert them into furnaces or other entities.\n\n- **Errors when trying to insert into furnaces without fuel**\n  - Make sure to have enough fuel (like coal) in your inventory to keep the furnaces operational. If the furnaces are running low on fuel, prioritize refueling them.\n\n- **Repeated errors with coal insertion**\n  - When inserting coal into furnaces, ensure that the coal inventory is not full and that the furnace has space for additional coal."}
