{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) with a wooden chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) and another at (x=-15.5, y=-48.5) for storage.\n- **Furnace 1** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0) with a burner inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) that transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Furnace 2** at position (x=-10.0, y=-48.0) with a burner inserter at position (x=-8.5, y=-47.5) that transfers iron ore from a wooden chest at position (x=-7.5, y=-47.5) to the furnace.\n- **Storage Chest** at position (x=-6.5, y=-48.5) for storing iron plates produced by Furnace 1.\n\n### Iron Ore Collection System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) that extracts iron ore and deposits it into adjacent wooden chests at positions (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) and (x=-15.5, y=-48.5).\n\n### Inserter Network\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) waiting for source items to transfer from the chest to Furnace 1.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-8.5, y=-47.5) waiting for source items to transfer from the chest to Furnace 2.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-11.5, y=-45.5) waiting for source items.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Incorrect use of API for inventory inspection\n- When using `inspect_inventory`, ensure the first argument is an Entity or Position object, not an integer. This will prevent `ValueError` related to incorrect argument types.\n\n### Errors in entity retrieval by position\n- When retrieving an entity by position, ensure the entity type exists at the specified position to avoid exceptions related to missing entities."}
