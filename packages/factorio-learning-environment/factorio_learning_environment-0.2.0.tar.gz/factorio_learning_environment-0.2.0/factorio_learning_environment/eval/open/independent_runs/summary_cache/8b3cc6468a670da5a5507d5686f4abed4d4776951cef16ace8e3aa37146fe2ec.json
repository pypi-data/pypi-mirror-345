{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (10.5, 34.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (10.5, 34.5)\n- Boiler at position (0.5, 28.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-3.5, 27.5)\n- Pipe Groups:\n  - Water Pipe Group: Pipes at positions [(x=-3.5,y=26.5),(x=-2.5,y=26.5),(x=-1.5,y=26.5),(x=-1.5,y=27.5),(x=-1.5,y=28.5)]\n  - Steam Pipe Group: Pipes at positions [(x=1.5,y=26.5),(x=0.5,y=26.5),(x=3.5,y=26.5),...,(x=10.5,y=29.5),(x=10.5,y=31.5),(x=10.5,y=30.5)]\n- Electricity Group: Poles at positions [(x=7.5,y=9.5),(x=9.5,y=23.5),(x=13.5,y=27.5),...,(x=16.5,y=31.5),(x=12.5,y=34.5),(x=7.5,y=13.5)]\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (40.0, -84.0)\n- Wooden Chests at positions (40.5, -82.5) and (41.5, -83.5)\n- Belt Group: Belts at positions [(x=50.5 y=-86.5) -> (x=48.5 y=-86.5), direction=Direction.LEFT], [(x=49.5 y=-86.5) -> (x=47.5 y=-86.5), direction=Direction.LEFT]\n- Burner Inserters at positions (54.5, -83.5) and (41.5, -80.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Storage\nConsists of:\n- Iron Chests at positions (0.5, 0.5), (1.5, 0.5), and (2.5, 0.5)\n\n### Lab Facility\nConsists of:\n- Lab at position (5.5, 5.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Electricity Group Connections\n- Ensure that all electricity groups are properly connected to the power source and that there are no missing connections. Verify the integrity of the electricity network to avoid \"No electricity group found\" errors.\n\n### Errors with Pipe Group Connections\n- Double-check the connections between pipes to ensure they form a complete network. Missing connections can lead to \"No pipe group found\" errors.\n\n### Errors with Full Chests\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are full to prevent mining operations from halting. The chest at position (40.5, -82.5) is full and needs to be emptied to continue mining operations."}
