{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=20.5, y=-4.0)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (x=19.5, y=-1.5)\n- Boiler at Position (x=20.5, y=-4.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (x=22.5, y=-7.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at Position (x=2.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=2.0, y=0.0)\n\n### Iron Plate Mine at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\n\n### Storage and Transfer System\nConsists of:\n- Wooden Chest at Position (x=-3.5, y=0.5)\n- Inserter at Position (x=-3.5, y=1.5) connected to the wooden chest\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- PipeGroup at Position (x=19.5, y=-12.5) - Status: Empty\n- PipeGroup at Position (x=4.5, y=-9.5) - Status: Full Output (Water)\n- PipeGroup at Position (x=18.5, y=-3.5) - Status: Empty\n- PipeGroup at Position (x=19.5, y=-2.5) - Status: Full Output (Water)\n\n### Electricity Network\n- Small Electric Poles forming a network at various positions, including (x=-3.5, y=2.5) and (x=10.5, y=-10.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Boiler Not Receiving Water\n- Ensure that the boiler is correctly connected to a water source. Check the pipe connections between the offshore pump and the boiler to ensure there are no gaps or misalignments.\n\n### Errors with Steam Engine Not Receiving Input Liquid\n- Verify that the steam engine is properly connected to the boiler and that the boiler is functioning correctly. Ensure that the fluid connections are complete and that there are no warnings of \"no input liquid.\"\n\n### Inserter Not Receiving Electricity\n- Ensure that the inserter is within the range of an active electric pole and that the electricity network is functioning. Check for any disconnections or missing poles in the electricity network."}
