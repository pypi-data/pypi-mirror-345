{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing Facility at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0), connected to a Stone Furnace at position (43.0, -82.0)\n- Iron Chests at positions (41.5, -80.5), (42.5, -80.5), (44.5, -80.5), (45.5, -80.5), (47.5, -80.5), and (49.5, -80.5) for storage\n- Burner Inserters at positions (43.5, -80.5) and (41.5, -78.5) for moving items between entities\n- Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -79.5) for additional storage\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0), connected to a Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0)\n- Iron Chests at positions (-18.5, -48.5), (-16.5, -48.5), (-15.5, -48.5), and (-13.5, -49.5) for storage\n- Wooden Chests at positions (-14.5, -48.5), (-12.5, -49.5), and (-9.5, -49.5) for additional storage\n- Burner Inserters at positions (-12.5, -44.5), (-10.5, -44.5), (-8.5, -44.5), (-10.5, -49.5), (-11.5, -49.5), (-8.5, -49.5), and (-7.5, -48.5) for moving items between entities\n- Stone Furnaces at positions (-11.0, -48.0) and (-9.0, -48.0) for smelting iron ore\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Items\n- Ensure that there is a continuous supply of items to the inserters at positions (-12.5, -44.5), (-10.5, -44.5), and (-8.5, -44.5) to prevent them from waiting for items. Check the upstream supply chain to ensure it is not blocked or depleted.\n\n### Chest Full Warnings\n- Regularly clear out the contents of chests at positions (41.5, -80.5) and (-14.5, -48.5) to prevent mining drills from stopping due to full chests.\n\n### Furnace No Ingredients Warning\n- Ensure that furnaces have a consistent supply of raw materials to prevent them from running out of ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Furnace Output Full Warning\n- Regularly clear the output of furnaces to prevent them from becoming blocked and stopping production. Ensure there is enough space in downstream storage to accommodate the output.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Space in Destination\n- Ensure that the destination for the inserters is not blocked and has sufficient space to accept items. Regularly manage inventory to prevent blockages."}
