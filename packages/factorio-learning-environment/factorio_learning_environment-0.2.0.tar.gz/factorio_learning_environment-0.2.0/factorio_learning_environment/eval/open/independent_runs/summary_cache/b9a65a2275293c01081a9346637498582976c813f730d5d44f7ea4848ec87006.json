{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Plate Smelting Setup at Position(x=52.0, y=-79.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=52.0, y=-79.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=53.5, y=-79.5) for transferring items into the furnace. Currently out of fuel.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=54.5, y=-79.5) storing iron plates.\n\n#### Iron Ore Mining Setup at Position(x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) for mining iron ore. Currently out of fuel and the chest at the drop position is full.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) for storing mined iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) for transferring iron ore from the mining drill to the chest.\n\n#### Coal Storage Setup at Position(x=41.5, y=-80.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=41.5, y=-80.5) for storing items.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=43.5, y=-80.5) storing coal.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=42.5, y=-80.5) for transferring items between chests. Currently waiting for source items.\n\n#### General Storage Setup at Position(x=0.5, y=0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=0.5, y=0.5) storing various items including coal, iron ore, and iron plates.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=1.5, y=0.5) storing coal, iron ore, and other items.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=2.5, y=0.5) storing coal.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=3.5, y=0.5) storing coal.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=4.5, y=0.5) storing coal and iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=5.5, y=0.5) storing iron ore, iron plates, and iron gear wheels.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when mining drill is not working\n- Ensure the mining drill has sufficient fuel and the chest at the drop position is not full. Empty the chest or add fuel to the drill to resume mining.\n\n#### Errors when inserter is out of fuel\n- Add fuel to the inserter to enable it to transfer items. Coal is a common fuel source for burner inserters.\n\n#### Errors when furnace has no ingredients\n- Ensure the furnace has the necessary ingredients (e.g., iron ore) and fuel to start smelting. Use inserters to transfer items into the furnace.\n\n#### Errors when inserter is waiting for source items\n- Ensure the source chest or entity has items available for the inserter to pick up. If the source is empty, replenish it.\n\n#### Errors when chest is full\n- Empty the chest to allow new items to be deposited. This is particularly important for mining drills and inserters that rely on chests for storage."}
