Entity Placement Conflicts\n- Always check if target position is clear before placing entities\n- Common error: Attempting to place entities where others already exist\n- Solution: Verify space is available and remove conflicting entities if needed\n\n2. System Building Order\n- Build systems from bottom to top to avoid placement conflicts\n- When rebuilding, remove conflicting entities before placing new ones\n\nNAMESPACE\nImportant Variables:\n- input_inserter: BurnerInserter\n- left_inserter: BurnerInserter\n- right_inserter: BurnerInserter\n- center_belt: TransportBelt\n- first_belt: TransportBelt\n- split_belt: TransportBelt\n\nNo utility functions were defined in the provided logs."}
