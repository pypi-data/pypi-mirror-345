{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, y=-60.0) with a drop position at (4.5, y=-58.5). The drill is currently working but has a warning: \"chest at drop position is full. Empty the chest at (4.5, -58.5) to continue mining.\"\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions:\n  - (4.5, y=-58.5) containing 6 iron ore.\n  - (5.5, y=-60.5), (7.5, y=-60.5), (6.5, y=-60.5), (9.5, y=-60.5), (8.5, y=-60.5), all empty.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions:\n  - (-15.0, y=-48.0) with 18 coal, working, containing 4 iron ore and producing iron plates.\n  - (-13.0, y=-48.0) with 24 coal, working, producing iron plates.\n  - (-11.0, y=-48.0) with 36 coal, not working due to \"no ingredients to smelt\", producing iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items\n- Ensure that you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. For example, the error \"Could not insert: No coal to insert from your inventory\" suggests that the agent attempted to insert coal without having any in the inventory.\n\n### Warnings about full chests\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are full to maintain continuous operation of mining drills. The warning \"chest at drop position is full\" indicates that the mining drill cannot continue working until the chest is emptied.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- **insert_item**: This function attempts to insert a specified quantity of an item into a target entity. It failed due to insufficient items in the inventory.\n\n### Important Variables\n- **drill**: Represents the burner mining drill entity.\n- **furnace_source**: Represents the inventory of raw materials in the furnace.\n- **furnace_result**: Represents the inventory of produced items in the furnace."}
