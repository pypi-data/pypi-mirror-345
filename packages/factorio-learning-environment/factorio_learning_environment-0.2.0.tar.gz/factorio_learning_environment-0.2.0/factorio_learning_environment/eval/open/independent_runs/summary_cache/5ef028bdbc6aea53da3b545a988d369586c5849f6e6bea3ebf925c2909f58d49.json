Double-check the entity type and its contents before attempting extraction.\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities in Occupied or Invalid Positions\n- Before placing an entity, verify that the target position is unoccupied and suitable for the entity type. Consider adjusting spacing, changing direction, or selecting a different reference position to avoid collisions with existing entities or unsuitable terrain.\n\n### Errors when Refueling or Operating with Insufficient Resources\n- Regularly check the fuel levels of entities like mining drills and inserters to ensure continuous operation. Keep a sufficient stock of fuel in your inventory to refuel entities as needed."}
