{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) extracting coal, dropping into a Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5).\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Transport System at Position (-23.0, -68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) extracting copper ore, dropping into a Wooden Chest at position (-23.5, -69.5).\n- A network of Transport Belts connecting the mining drill to various positions for ore movement.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) extracting iron ore, dropping into a Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -54.5).\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5) transferring items between chests and belts.\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage and Distribution at Position (-16.5, -64.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chests at positions (-16.5, -64.5) and (-14.5, -64.5) storing iron ore and plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-15.5, -64.5) managing item transfer between chests.\n\n### Miscellaneous Storage Chests\n- Multiple Wooden Chests at various positions for storing different resources like iron ore, copper plate, and coal.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Stale Entity Data\n- Ensure that entity data is current and valid before attempting operations. Avoid using stale or outdated references to entities.\n\n### Attribute Errors with BeltGroup Objects\n- Verify that objects have the required attributes before accessing them. In this case, ensure that you are not attempting to access a 'prototype' attribute on a BeltGroup object, as it does not exist.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source for the inserter is not empty and that there are items available for the inserter to pick up. Check the status of connected entities to ensure they are functioning correctly.\n\n### Chest Full Warnings\n- Regularly monitor and manage the inventory of chests to prevent them from becoming full, which can halt production processes. Consider adding more storage or using items efficiently to free up space."}
