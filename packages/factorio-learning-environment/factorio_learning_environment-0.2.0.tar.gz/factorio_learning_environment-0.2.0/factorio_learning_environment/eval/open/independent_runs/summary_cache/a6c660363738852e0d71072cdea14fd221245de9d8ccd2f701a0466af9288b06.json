{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position(-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position -15.0, -50.0) with a wooden chest at drop position (-14.5, -48.5) for storage. The drill is currently working but has a warning indicating that the chest is full.\n  \n### Stone Furnace at position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace (position 0.0, 0.0) which has warnings indicating no ingredients to smelt and that the furnace result is full. It is currently holding 100 iron plates as output.\n- A wooden chest (position 2.5, 0.5) that contains 100 iron plates.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n- **Errors when the chest at drop position is full**: \n  - Ensure to empty the chest at (-14.5, -48.5) to allow the Burner Mining Drill to continue mining.\n  \n- **Errors when the Stone Furnace has no ingredients to smelt**: \n  - Make sure to feed the Stone Furnace with iron ore to enable it to produce iron plates.\n\n- **Errors when the Stone Furnace result is full**: \n  - Regularly check the output inventory of the Stone Furnace and clear it to maintain production flow.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- **Utility Functions**: None defined or invoked.\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `burner_mining_drill_position`: Tuple[int, int] = (-15, -50)\n  - `stone_furnace_position`: Tuple[int, int] = (0, 0)\n  - `wooden_chest_position`: Tuple[int, int] = (2, 0)"}
