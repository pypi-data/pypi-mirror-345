{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Mining and Smelting Setup at (-28, -61)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-28.0, -61.0) connected to\n- Stone furnace at (-27.0, -59.0)\n- Burner inserter at (-28.5, -58.5) feeding into the furnace\n- Burner inserter at (-25.5, -58.5) outputting to wooden chest\n- Wooden chest at (-24.5, -58.5) storing copper plates\n- Additional burner inserter at (-24.5, -57.5) connected to the chest\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Complex at (-10, -59)\nConsists of three mining drills in a row:\n- Burner mining drill at (-10.0, -59.0)\n- Burner mining drill at (-8.0, -59.0)\n- Burner mining drill at (-6.0, -59.0)\nEach connected to wooden chests at (-9.5, -57.5), (-7.5, -57.5), and (-5.5, -57.5) respectively\n\n### Iron Smelting Line at (0, 0)\nConsists of four parallel smelting units:\n1. First unit:\n   - Stone furnace at (0.0, 0.0)\n   - Input chest at (0.5, -2.5)\n   - Output chest at (0.5, 2.5)\n   - Input inserter at (0.5, -1.5)\n   - Output inserter at (0.5, 1.5)\n\n2. Second unit:\n   - Stone furnace at (2.0, 0.0)\n   - Input chest at (2.5, -2.5)\n   - Output chest at (2.5, 2.5)\n   - Input inserter at (2.5, -1.5)\n   - Output inserter at (2.5, 1.5)\n\n3. Third unit:\n   - Stone furnace at (4.0, 0.0)\n   - Input chest at (4.5, -2.5)\n   - Output chest at (4.5, 2.5)\n   - Input inserter at (4.5, -1.5)\n   - Output inserter at (4.5, 1.5)\n\n4. Fourth unit:\n   - Stone furnace at (6.0, 0.0)\n   - Input chest at (6.5, -2.5)\n   - Output chest at (6.5, 2.5)\n   - Input inserter at (6.5, -1.5)\n   - Output inserter at (6.5, 1.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when attempting to place belts on occupied tiles\n- Check if the target position is free before placing transport belts\n- Ensure there are no other entities (like chests or inserters) occupying the target position\n\n### Errors with direct belt connections\n- Cannot connect belts directly to chests\n- Use inserters to move items between chests and belts\n- Always use appropriate intermediary devices (like inserters) when connecting different types of entities\n\n### Entity Status Issues\n- Multiple mining drills are out of fuel - ensure consistent fuel supply\n- Several furnaces have no ingredients - verify the input logistics chain is working properly"}
