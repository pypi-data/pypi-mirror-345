{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n###Iron Plate Production Area at position(-11.5, 19.5)\nConsists of two stone furnaces for smelting iron ore into iron plates:\n- First stone furnace at position(-11.0, 20.0)\n- Second stone furnace at position(-9.0, 20.0)\nBoth furnaces are operational with coal as fuel but currently idle due to lack of input materials.\n\n###Coal Mining Complex at position(20.0, -15.0)\nA series of coal mining setups consisting of:\n- First setup: Burner mining drill at (20.0, -15.0) with burner inserter at (20.5, -13.5)\n- Second setup: Burner mining drill at (22.0, -15.0) with burner inserter at (23.5, -14.5)\n- Third setup: Burner mining drill at (24.0, -15.0) with wooden chest at (23.5, -16.5)\nThe third setup is fully operational with the mining drill working and outputting to the collection chest.\n\n###Iron Ore Mining Setup at position(-14.0, 23.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-14.0, 23.0)\n- Wooden chest at (-14.5, 21.5) for collecting iron ore\nThe setup is fully operational with the mining drill actively extracting iron ore into the collection chest.\n\n###Copper Production Complex at position(20.0, 20.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (20.0, 20.0)\n- Wooden chest at (20.5, 21.5) for collecting copper ore\n- Stone furnace at (24.0, 20.0) for smelting copper plates\n- Burner inserter at (21.5, 21.5) to transport ore from chest to furnace\nThe mining setup is operational, but the inserter's drop position is misaligned with the furnace input.\n\nERROR TIPS\n### Errors with inserter output configuration\n- When placing inserters, ensure there is a valid destination entity for the items being moved\n- Configure the inserter's drop position to align with the target entity's input (furnace)\n- The drop position should match the input position of the target entity\n- Remove and replace inserters if their drop positions are incorrect\n\n### Errors with inserter fuel management\n- Always add fuel to burner inserters immediately after placement\n- Keep spare fuel in inventory for inserter refueling\n- Monitor inserter fuel levels to prevent operation interruptions\n\n### Errors when setting up automated material transport\n- Plan the complete input-output chain before placing transport entities\n- Ensure all entities in the transport chain (inserters, chests, furnaces) are properly positioned and configured\n- Verify that the entire transport path is clear and entities are properly aligned\n- Double-check the drop positions of inserters match the input positions of target entities\n\n### Errors with blocked outputs\n- Clear any items on the ground that might block inserter operations\n- Ensure there is a valid receiving entity at the inserter's drop position\n- Verify the receiving entity (like a furnace) has available space for inputs"}
