{"content": "# FACTORIO REPORT\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System at position(-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump (position x=-9.5, y=-0.5)\n- Boiler (position x=-5.0, y=2.5) with 18 coal remaining\n- Steam engine (position x=0.5, y=2.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the components\n- Small electric poles for power distribution\n\nThe power generation system is experiencing connection issues. The boiler is reporting \"no input liquid\" and \"no fluid present in connections\" warnings, indicating problems with the water supply from the offshore pump.\n\n### Operational Power Generation System at position(-9.5, -2.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump (position x=-9.5, y=-2.5)\n- Boiler (position x=-5.5, y=-2.0) with 26 coal remaining\n- Steam engine (position x=0.5, y=20.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the components\n- Small electric poles for power distribution (positions x=0.5, y=25.5 through x=40.5, y=37.5)\n\nThis power generation system is operational with the boiler showing WORKING status. The steam engine is also working, with steam flowing through the pipes. The system is generating electricity for the factory.\n\n### Assembly Line at positions(-7.5, 30.5) to (8.5, 38.5)\nConsists of:\n- Iron gear wheel assembler (position x=-7.5, y=30.5)\n- Copper cable assembler (position x=-7.5, y=38.5)\n- Electronic circuit assembler (position x=0.5, y=38.5)\n- Inserter assembler (position x=4.5, y=38.5)\n- Iron plate input chest (position x=-11.5, y=30.5) containing 152 iron plates\n- Copper plate input chest (position x=-11.5, y=38.5) containing 57 copper plates\n- Output chest (position x=8.5, y=38.5)\n- Burner inserters replacing electric inserters (positions x=-9.5, y=30.5; x=-9.5, y=38.5; x=-4.5, y=37.5; x=6.5, y=38.5)\n- Small electric poles for power distribution\n\nThe assembly line has burner inserters with coal to make them operational without electricity. However, the assemblers themselves are not receiving power and cannot produce items.\n\n### New Assembly Line at positions(37.5, 40.5) to (55.5, 45.5)\nConsists of:\n- Iron gear wheel assembler (position x=40.5, y=40.5) - WORKING\n- Copper cable assembler (position x=40.5, y=45.5)\n- Electronic circuit assembler (position x=45.5, y=45.5)\n- Inserter assembler (position x=50.5, y=45.5)\n- Iron plate input chest (position x=37.5, y=40.5) containing 24 iron plates\n- Copper plate input chest (position x=37.5, y=45.5)\n- Gear output chest (position x=43.5, y=40.5) containing 14 iron gear wheels\n- Cable output chest (position x=43.5, y=45.5) containing 63 copper cables\n- Circuit output chest (position x=48.5, y=45.5)\n- Final output chest (position x=55.5, y=45.5)\n- Small electric poles for power distribution (positions x=40.5, y=38.5; x=40.5, y=42.5; x=45.5, y=42.5; x=50.5, y=42.5)\n- Burner inserters with coal for material movement:\n  - Iron input inserter (position x=38.5, y=40.5)\n  - Copper input inserter (position x=38.5, y=45.5)\n  - Gear output inserter (position x=42.5, y=40.5)\n  - Cable output inserter (position x=42.5, y=45.5)\n  "}
