{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Boiler System at Position (1.5, 1.0) and (2.5, 3.0)\n- Consists of two boilers at positions (1.5, 1.0) and (2.5, 3.0).\n- The system is currently not connected to any fluid source, as indicated by warnings of \"no input liquid\" and \"no fluid present in connections\".\n\n### Offshore Pump System at Position (-7.5, 25.5)\n- Comprises an offshore pump at position (-7.5, 25.5) connected to a series of pipes.\n- The system is operational, providing water to connected pipes.\n\n### Furnace and Inserter System at Position (15.0, 0.0)\n- Includes a stone furnace at position (15.0, 0.0) with a connected inserter at position (16.5, 0.5).\n- The furnace is active but lacks ingredients to smelt, while the inserter is not connected to a power network.\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (10.5, 34.5)\n- Consists of a steam engine at position (10.5, 34.5) with associated small electric poles and pipes.\n- The generator is not connected to the power network and lacks input liquid.\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- Multiple pipe groups exist, with some containing water and others empty. Notable positions include:\n  - PipeGroup at (-14.5, 17.5) with water.\n  - PipeGroup at (1.5, 29.5) with water, indicating a full output status.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Steam Engines\n- Ensure the target location for placing steam engines is clear of obstructions and not over unplaceable terrain like water.\n- Verify the terrain suitability before attempting to place a steam engine.\n\n### Errors in Retrieving Steam Engine Entities\n- Confirm the presence of a steam engine at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it using the API.\n- Double-check the coordinates and ensure the entity exists at the specified location.\n\n### Errors when Placing Pipes\n- Check for terrain suitability and ensure no obstructions are present before placing pipes.\n- Validate the target location is appropriate for pipe placement to avoid errors."}
