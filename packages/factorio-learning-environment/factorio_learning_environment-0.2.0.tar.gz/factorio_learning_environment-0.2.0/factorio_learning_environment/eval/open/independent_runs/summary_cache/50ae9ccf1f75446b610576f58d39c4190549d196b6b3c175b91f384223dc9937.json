{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) with a drop position at (x=-15.5, y=-51.5). The drill is currently operational but has a warning that the chest at the drop position is full.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-15.5, y=-51.5) containing iron ore. The chest is full, preventing further mining.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-51.5) which is waiting for source items. It picks up from (x=-14.5, y=-51.5) and drops to (x=-12.5, y=-51.5).\n- **Transport Belt** connecting the mining drill to the furnace, with inputs from (x=-13.5, y=-51.5) to (x=-11.5, y=-51.5) and outputs from (x=0.5, y=-3.5) to (x=0.5, y=-1.5).\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with warnings of no ingredients to smelt and furnace result is full. It contains iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=0.5, y=-1.5) waiting for source items. It picks up from (x=0.5, y=-2.5) and drops to (x=0.5, y=-0.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Full Chest\n- Ensure that the chest at the drop position of the mining drill is regularly emptied to prevent mining stoppage.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Operation\n- Ensure that the furnace has the necessary ingredients to smelt and that the furnace result inventory is not full to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Errors with Belt and Inserter Blockages\n- Regularly check the status of belts and inserters for blockages and ensure they are operational to maintain smooth transportation of materials.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- **check_belt_and_inserter_status()**: This function checks the status of belts and inserters for blockages. It should be invoked regularly to ensure smooth operation.\n\n### Important Variables\n- **iron_ore_inventory**: int, current count of iron ore in the inventory.\n- **iron_plate_inventory**: int, current count of iron plates in the inventory.\n- **wood_inventory**: int, current count of wood in the inventory.\n- **stone_inventory**: int, current count of stone in the inventory."}
