{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage at Position (53.0, -83.0)\n- Consists of a Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) and a Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5).\n\n### Copper Ore Mining at Position (-23.0, -68.0)\n- Consists of a Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) and a Wooden Chest at position (-24.5, -67.5).\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\n- Consists of a Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) and a Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -54.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\n- Consists of:\n  - A Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with a Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5).\n  - A Burner Inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) transferring items between Wooden Chests at positions (1.5, 0.5) and (3.5, 0.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Processing Line\n- Consists of:\n  - A Furnace at position (-19.0, -65.0) with a Burner Inserter at position (-20.5, -66.5).\n  - A Wooden Chest at position (-16.5, -64.5) with a Burner Inserter at position (-17.5, -64.5).\n  - BeltGroup connecting various positions to facilitate material flow.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting entities\n- Ensure that all entities being connected have valid attributes and are not `NoneType`. This error suggests that there might be an attempt to connect entities that are not properly initialized or do not exist.\n\n### Output Blocked by Item on the Ground\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity to accept the output from drills or other production entities to prevent blockage.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entity has items available for the inserter to pick up. Check that the inserter is correctly positioned and configured to access the source items.\n\n### No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to process. Verify that the supply chain feeding into the furnace is complete and functioning correctly."}
