{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Plate Production Structure at position(16.0, 71.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (16.0, 71.0)\n- Burner inserter at position (16.5, 73.5)\n- Stone furnace at position (17.0, 75.0)\n- Burner inserter at position (15.5, 75.5)\n- Burner inserter at position (17.5, 73.5)\n- Belt group connecting the entities\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when placing entities next to each other\n- Ensure there is enough space to place an entity next to another entity. Consider increasing the spacing or changing the direction.\n\n#### Errors when connecting entities directly\n- Transport belts cannot be connected directly to certain entities like furnaces. Use an inserter that inputs or outputs items into or from the entity as the target.\n\n#### Common issues with entity placement\n- Check for nearby entities that might be blocking the placement.\n- Ensure the area where you are trying to place an entity is not water or another unbuildable terrain.\n\n#### Errors due to undefined variables\n- Ensure all variables are defined before they are used in the code.\n\n#### Errors when inserting items into entities\n- Ensure there are items to insert in the inventory before attempting to insert them into an entity.\n- Ensure there is a nearby entity that can accept the items being inserted.\n\n#### Errors when using insert_item function\n- The `insert_item` function failed because there was no iron-ore to insert from the inventory or no nearby entity that can accept iron-ore.\n\n#### Errors when placing entities too far away\n- Ensure the target position is within the maximum allowed distance (10 units) from the current position.\n\n#### Errors when connecting entities with occupied positions\n- Ensure the target position for connecting entities is not occupied by other entities.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\nNo utility functions have been defined by the agent in the given logs. Hence, this section is not included."}
