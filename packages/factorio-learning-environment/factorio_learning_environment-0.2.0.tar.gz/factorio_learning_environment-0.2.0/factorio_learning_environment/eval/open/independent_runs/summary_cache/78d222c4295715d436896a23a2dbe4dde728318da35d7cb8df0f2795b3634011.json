{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Wooden Chest at position(-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Chest (position -14.5, -48.5) with an inventory containing 417 iron ore.\n\n### Furnace at position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace (position 0.0, 0.0) with a current status of no ingredients to smelt and an inventory containing 49 iron plates.\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position(-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position -15.0, -50.0) which is currently out of fuel and has a warning indicating that the chest at (-14.5, -48.5) is full.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting iron ore\n- Ensure you have iron ore in your inventory before attempting to insert it into the chest or furnace. The agent has encountered multiple errors indicating that there was no iron ore available for insertion.\n\n### Errors when extracting from a full chest\n- The burner mining drill is unable to continue mining because the chest at (-14.5, -48.5) is full. Empty the chest to allow the mining drill to continue its operation.\n\n### Errors when the furnace has no ingredients\n- The furnace at (0.0, 0.0) is currently unable to smelt due to a lack of ingredients. Ensure that there are sufficient raw materials available for smelting.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the current execution steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `iron-ore`: int (count of iron ore in the chest)\n- `chest_position`: tuple (coordinates of the wooden chest)\n- `furnace_position`: tuple (coordinates of the furnace)\n- `burner_mining_drill_position`: tuple (coordinates of the burner mining drill)"}
