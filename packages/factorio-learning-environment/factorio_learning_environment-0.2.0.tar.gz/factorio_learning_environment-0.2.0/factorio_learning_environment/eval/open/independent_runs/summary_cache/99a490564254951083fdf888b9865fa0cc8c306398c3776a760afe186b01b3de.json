{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nThere are currently no structures on the map. The agent attempted to place various entities such as furnaces, wooden chests, and transport belts, but all attempts were unsuccessful due to placement errors. Therefore, no structures have been established.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when attempting to place entities in non-buildable areas\n- Ensure that the area is clear and suitable for building before attempting to place an entity. Verify that the terrain is appropriate and that there are no obstructions.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied or unsuitable\n- Check the specific tile for any existing entities or restrictions before placing a new entity. This includes ensuring that the tile is not already occupied by another entity or marked as non-buildable.\n\n### Errors due to lack of nearby entities for resource insertion\n- When inserting resources into an entity, ensure that the target entity is already placed and within proximity to accept the resources. Verify that the entity is correctly positioned and capable of receiving the intended items.\n\n### Errors due to unavailable resources for operations\n- Confirm that the necessary resources are available in the inventory before attempting to supply them to entities. This includes ensuring that the resources are accessible and sufficient for the intended operation.\n\n### Errors due to incorrect initialization or setup\n- Before starting operations, verify that the environment is correctly initialized and that all necessary checks have been completed. This includes ensuring that the initial setup is correct and that any global restrictions are considered.\n\nBy addressing these errors, the agent can improve its efficiency in placing entities and establishing functional structures on the map."}
