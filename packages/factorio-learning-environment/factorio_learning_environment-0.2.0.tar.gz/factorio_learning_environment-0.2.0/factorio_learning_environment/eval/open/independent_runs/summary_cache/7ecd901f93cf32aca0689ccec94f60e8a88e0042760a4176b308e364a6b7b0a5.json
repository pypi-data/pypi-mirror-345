In this step the furnace received iron ore and coal and later provided an increased number of iron plates.\n\u2022 Entity: Furnace at Position(x=5.0, y=5.0)\n\n### Copper Smelting Furnace at position(-27.0, -60.0)\nUsed for smelting copper ore into copper plates. The copper furnace processed harvested copper ore (with coal) to yield copper plates.\n\u2022 Entity: Copper Furnace at Position(x=-27.0, y=-60.0)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 API Usage Errors:\n  - Use the correct signature for get_entities. Avoid passing unexpected keyword arguments (like 'radius') or extra positional arguments. Confirm the required parameters before calling.\n\n\u2022 Lab Placement and Retrieval Issues:\n  - Verify that a Lab is available in the inventory before attempting placement to avoid placement errors.\n  - When handling lab retrieval from get_entities, ensure the returned value is a valid list (or fallback to an empty list) rather than assuming it is iterable.\n\n\u2022 Crafting Resource Shortages:\n  - Confirm that all sub-ingredients needed for lab crafting (such as iron-gear-wheel, electronic-circuit, copper-cable, and their upstream ingredients) are sufficiently available.\n  - Ensure that the production chain (including proper smelting operations for both iron and copper resources) is adequately established before initiating lab crafting."}
