{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Cable Factory at approximately (2.5, 17.5)\nConsists of the key production\u2010line components for copper cable manufacture:\n\u2022 Input Chest at Position(x=2.5, y=17.5) serving as the factory interface  \n\u2022 Burner Inserter at Position(x=3.5, y=17.5) using direction RIGHT, placed adjacent to the input chest  \n\u2022 Burner Inserter at Position(x=2.5, y=16.5) that links into the factory system  \n\u2022 Assembling Machine at Position(x=1.5, y=19.5) for processing copper cable recipes  \n\u2022 Burner Inserter at Position(x=1.5, y=17.5) (fuelled with coal) supporting item transfer in the production line\n\n### Depot Belt System at (3.5, 15.5)\nProvides an isolated belt depot for intermediate item transfer between extraction and production:\n\u2022 Wooden Chest Depot at Position(x=3.5, y=15.5) placed to serve as the belt depot  \n\u2022 Transport Belt Segment at Position(x=4.5, y=15.5) located adjacent to the depot chest  \n\u2022 Depot Burner Inserter at Position(x=3.5, y=14.5) using direction UP, positioned immediately beside the depot chest\n\n### Extraction System Node at (-3.5, 27.5)\nSupports extraction operations by handling drop\u2010off of mined items:\n\u2022 Extraction System Burner Inserter at Position(x=-3.5, y=27.5) with a drop position at Position(x=-3.5, y=28.5)\n\n### Electricity Generator at (-0.5, 24.5)\nIntegrates components for power generation:\n\u2022 Steam Engine at Position(x=-0.5, y=24.5)  \n\u2022 Boiler at Position(x=-5.5, y=24.0)  \n\u2022 Offshore Pump at Position(x=-7.5, y=25.5)\n\n### Laboratory (Position not specified)\nFacilitates research and processing of science packs:\n\u2022 Lab with input {'automation-science-pack': 17} and electrical_id=7106\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n\u2022 Transport Belt Connection Issues  \n\u2003\u2013 When connecting transport belts, always use an inserter as the target rather than attempting to connect directly to a steam engine. This prevents errors such as \u201cTransport belts cannot be connected directly to a Prototype.SteamEngine object.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Placement Distance and Inventory Verification  \n\u2003\u2013 Ensure that the agent is close enough to the target position before attempting to place an entity to avoid distance\u2010related placement errors.  \n\u2003\u2013 Verify that the inventory contains the required entity (for example, a wooden chest) before attempting its placement.\n\n\u2022 Undefined Variable References  \n\u2003\u2013 Check that all variables (such as the intended target entity) are correctly defined and referenced to avoid NameError exceptions (e.g. \u201ctarget_chest is not defined\u201d)."}
