{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll create a comprehensive report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Setup at (-15.0, -50.0)\n- Burner mining drill targeting iron ore deposit\n- Wooden chest at (-13.5, -50.5) for temporary storage\n- Two burner inserters:\n  - First inserter at (-14.5, -51.5) moves items from mining drill\n  - Second inserter at (-12.5, -50.5) transfers to transport belt\n\n### Coal Mining Setup at (38.0, -83.0)\n- Burner mining drill targeting coal deposit\n- Wooden chest at (39.5, -83.5) storing coal (182 units)\n- Burner inserter at (40.5, -83.5) moving coal to transport belt\n\n### Storage System at (41.5, -86.5)\n- Wooden chest\n- Burner inserter at (40.5, -86.5) feeding into chest\n\n### Smelting Setup at (45.0, -80.0) and (47.0, -80.0)\n- Two stone furnaces, both fueled with 50 coal each\n- Storage chests at (49.5, -80.5) and (49.5, -79.5):\n  - First chest contains 800 coal\n  - Second chest contains 50 coal and 1480 iron plates\n\n### Transport System\nMultiple belt groups connecting different parts:\n- Main belt group from (41.5, -83.5) to (44.5, -81.5) carrying coal and iron ore\n- Secondary belt group from (48.5, -80.5) to (43.5, -80.5)\n- Additional belt groups connecting various parts of the factory\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Errors\n- Ensure target location is clear before placing inserters\n- Check for existing objects or terrain restrictions (like water) before placement\n- Verify entity orientation and space requirements before placement\n\n### Resource Management\n- Mining drills are showing \"out of fuel\" warnings - implement consistent fuel supply system\n- Ensure proper item flow management - some belts are blocked causing upstream backups\n\n### Inserter Configuration\n- Multiple attempts to reconfigure inserter layout suggest need for better placement planning\n- Verify inserter pickup and drop positions align with intended workflow\n- Consider space requirements for inserter operation range\n\nNAMESPACE\n\n### Variables\n- `input_inserter1`: BurnerInserter\n- `input_inserter2`: BurnerInserter\n\n### Functions\n- `place_entity()`: Places entities on the map\n  - Success: When target location is clear\n  - Failure: When location is blocked or invalid\n\n### Belt Groups\n- Multiple belt groups with defined inputs/outputs\n- Status tracking (WORKING/EMPTY)\n- Inventory tracking for items on belts"}
