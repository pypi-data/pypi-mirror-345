{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (4.0, -60.0) with a drop position at (4.5, -58.5). Connected to a wooden chest at position (4.5, -58.5) storing iron ore.\n- Multiple wooden chests storing iron plates at positions (5.5, -60.5), (7.5, -60.5), (6.5, -60.5), (9.5, -60.5), (8.5, -60.5), and (4.5, -58.5).\n- Iron chest at position (-3.5, -52.5) storing a large quantity of iron plates.\n- Stone furnaces at positions (-15.0, -48.0), (-13.0, -48.0), and (-11.0, -48.0) used for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Coal Mining Facility\n- Harvesting coal from position (40.5, -82.5) to refuel entities such as the burner mining drill at position (4.0, -60.0).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when extracting from a chest\n- Ensure the chest is not full and has space to extract items. The repeated failure to extract iron ore from the chest at position (4.5, -58.5) indicates it may be full or there is a blockage in the extraction process.\n\n### Furnace Output Blockage\n- Regularly check furnaces for full output warnings. Ensure there is space in the connected chests to store smelted items to prevent blockage.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `burner_mining_drill_position`: Position of the burner mining drill (type: Position).\n- `chest_positions`: List of positions for chests storing iron ore and iron plates (type: List[Position]).\n- `furnace_positions`: List of positions for stone furnaces (type: List[Position]).\n- `coal_inventory`: Current inventory of coal (type: int).\n- `iron_plate_inventory`: Current inventory of iron plates (type: int)."}
