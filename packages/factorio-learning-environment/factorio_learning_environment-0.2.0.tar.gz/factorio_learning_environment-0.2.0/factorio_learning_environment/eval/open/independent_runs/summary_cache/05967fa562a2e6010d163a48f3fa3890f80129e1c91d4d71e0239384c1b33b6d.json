Regularly check fuel levels and replenish coal as needed.\n\n### Errors when Chest is Full\n- Regularly monitor the inventory of chests to prevent them from becoming full. Empty the chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) to continue mining operations smoothly.\n\n### Efficient Resource Management\n- Optimize the extraction and insertion of resources to maintain a steady production flow. Ensure that extracted resources are promptly inserted into the furnace to avoid bottlenecks."}
