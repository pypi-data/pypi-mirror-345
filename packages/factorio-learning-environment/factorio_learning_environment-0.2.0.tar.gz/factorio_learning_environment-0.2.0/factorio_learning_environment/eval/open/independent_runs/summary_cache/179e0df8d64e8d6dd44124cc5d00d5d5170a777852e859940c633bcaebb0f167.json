{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Electricity Generator at (x=-3.0, y=2.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump (x=-9.5, y=-0.5) [working, connected to water pipe]\n- Boiler (x=-3.0, y=2.5) [NO_FUEL warning, steam output at x=-1.5,y=2.5]\n- Steam engine (x=0.5, y=2.5) [NOT_CONNECTED, no input liquid]\nConnected by PipeGroup 5773 (water system)\n\n#### Oil Processing Facility\n1. Crude Oil Extraction:\n   - Pumpjack (x=17.5, y=40.5) [NO_POWER, crude oil deposit]\n   - Storage tank (x=4.5, y=15.5) [working, multiple pipe connections]\n\n2. Oil Refinery:\n   - Oil refinery (x=9.5, y=15.5) [NO_POWER, crude oil input at x=6.5,y=16.5]\n   - Petroleum gas output pipe (x=12.5, y=17.5) [empty PipeGroup 5789]\n\n3. Chemical Processing:\n   - Chemical plant (x=2.5, y=8.5) [NO_POWER, water input connected]\n   - Sulfur output tank (x=6.5, y=8.5) [empty]\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Persistent Connection Errors\n1. Offshore pump to boiler connection failures (x=-9.5,y=-0.5 to x=-3.0,y=2.5)\n   - Verify pipe continuity between positions (-8.5,-0.5) to (-3.0,2.5)\n   - Check pipe direction alignment (currently mismatched at x=-8.5,y=-0.5)\n\n2. Entity collision at pipe placement (x=-8.5,y=-0.5)\n   - Remove existing pipe at (-8.5,-0.5) before replacement\n   - Use scan_area() before placement operations\n\n#### Power System Issues\n1. Multiple NO_POWER states (pumpjack, refinery, chemical plant)\n   - Verify power pole coverage (electricity group 8704)\n   - Check steam engine connectivity (still NOT_CONNECTED)\n\n#### Fluid System Maintenance\n1. Boiler fuel depletion (still empty)\n   - Implement automated fuel replenishment\n   - Monitor fuel levels proactively\n\n2. Pipe placement sequencing\n   - Build pipelines from source to destination sequentially\n   - Verify each pipe segment connects properly before proceeding\n\n#### General Construction Tips\n1. Test connections in isolated segments\n2. Verify power requirements before placement\n3. Use debug tools to inspect entity states\n4. Implement error handling for placement operations\n5. Maintain minimum clearances between entities"}
