{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Offshore pump at position(-10.5, 25.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore pump (position -10.5, 25.5) connected to pipes for water extraction.\n\n### Boiler at position(-4.5, 24.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Boiler (position -4.5, 24.0) connected to the offshore pump via pipes.\n- Pipe connections to facilitate water flow.\n\n### Lab at position(5.5, -12.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab (position 5.5, -12.5) connected to the boiler for power supply.\n\n### Steam engine at position(-0.5, -9.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam engine (position -0.5, -9.5) connected to the boiler for power generation.\n\n### Pipe groups\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Multiple pipe groups facilitating fluid transport, with various positions and statuses.\n\n### Electric poles\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Multiple small electric poles providing power connections to various entities on the map.\n\n### Furnaces\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Two stone furnaces located at positions (0.0, 0.0) and (5.0, 5.0), currently without ingredients to smelt.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing pipe from offshore pump to boiler\n- Ensure that the arguments provided when placing objects are correct and do not conflict with each other. Review the API documentation for proper usage.\n\n### Errors when lab is not powered\n- Verify that the lab is properly connected to a power source. Ensure that the boiler is functioning and has fuel.\n\n### Errors with boiler status\n- Regularly check the boiler's fuel status and ensure it is supplied with the necessary fuel to maintain operation.\n\n### Errors with lab status\n- Confirm that the lab has a continuous power supply and is connected to the appropriate entities for operation.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it, checking for any obstructions."}
