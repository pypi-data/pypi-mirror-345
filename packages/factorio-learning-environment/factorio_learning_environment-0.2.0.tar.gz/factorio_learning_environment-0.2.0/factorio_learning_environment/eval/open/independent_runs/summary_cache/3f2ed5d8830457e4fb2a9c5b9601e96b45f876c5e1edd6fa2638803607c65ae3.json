Verify the entity's inventory before attempting to extract.\n\n### Errors when Furnaces Cannot Extract Iron Plates\n- Ensure that the furnaces have finished processing and that there is space in the inventory to store the extracted items. Consider checking the furnace status and inventory capacity before extraction attempts.\n\n### Errors when Clearing Chests\n- Verify that the chest you are trying to clear contains the items you wish to extract. Ensure that the chest is not empty or that the item type you are extracting is present.\n\n### Errors when Refueling\n- Before refueling, check if the entity already has sufficient fuel to avoid unnecessary actions."}
