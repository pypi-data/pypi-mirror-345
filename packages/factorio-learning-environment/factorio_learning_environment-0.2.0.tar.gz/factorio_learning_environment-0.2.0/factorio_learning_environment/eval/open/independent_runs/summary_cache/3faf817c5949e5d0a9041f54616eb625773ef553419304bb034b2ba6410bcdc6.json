{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-18.5, 19.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position -18.5, 19.5), boiler (position -13.5, 20.0), and offshore pump (position -11.5, 26.5).\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(-18.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position -18.0, -49.0) and a furnace (position -18.0, -49.0).\n\n### Lab at position(-17.5, 23.5)\nConsists of a lab (position -17.5, 23.5) that requires power to function.\n\n### Pipe network\nConsists of multiple pipe groups connecting various entities, facilitating fluid transport across the map.\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine (position not specified) and inserter that puts into the assembling machine.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when crafting items\n- Ensure the required items are available in the inventory before attempting to craft. In this case, iron ore is needed to craft iron plates.\n\n### Errors when connecting power\n- Make sure to connect the lab to a power source correctly. Check the connections to ensure that the lab is receiving power from the small electric pole.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it."}
