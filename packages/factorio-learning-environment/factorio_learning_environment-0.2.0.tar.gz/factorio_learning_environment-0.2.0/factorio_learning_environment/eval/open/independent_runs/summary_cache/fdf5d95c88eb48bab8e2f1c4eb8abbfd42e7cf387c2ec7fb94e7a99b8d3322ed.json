{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal\n  - Status: Working\n  - Neighbours: Wooden Chest at (-14.5, -48.5), Burner Inserter at (-13.5, -48.5)\n  - Warnings: Chest at drop position is full. Empty the chest at (-14.5, -48.5) to continue mining.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5)\n  - Inventory: 55 units of iron ore\n  - Status: Normal\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5)\n  - Fuel: Coal\n  - Status: Waiting for source items\n  - Neighbours: Wooden Chest at (-14.5, -48.5), Burner Mining Drill at (-15.0, -50.0), Stone Furnace at (-12.0, -48.0)\n  - Pickup Position: (-12.5, -48.5)\n  - Drop Position: (-14.5, -48.5)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal\n  - Status: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Inserter Setup\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items from the chest to the furnace. Repeated checks indicate the inserter is not transferring iron ore as expected.\n\n### Errors with Full Chest\n- Regularly monitor and empty the chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) to prevent mining operations from halting due to a full inventory.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Operation\n- Verify that the furnace has the necessary ingredients to smelt. The furnace is currently not receiving iron ore, which is preventing it from functioning correctly. Ensure the inserter is operational and correctly positioned to deliver iron ore to the furnace."}
