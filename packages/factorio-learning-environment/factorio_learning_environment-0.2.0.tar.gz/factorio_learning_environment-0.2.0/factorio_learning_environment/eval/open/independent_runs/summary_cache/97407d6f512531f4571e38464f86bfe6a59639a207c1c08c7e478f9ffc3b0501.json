{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Setup at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Fuel: Coal (4 units)\n  - Neighbours: Wooden Chest, Burner Inserter\n  - Resources: Iron Ore (10,000 units available)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5)\n  - Inventory: Iron Ore (519 units)\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5)\n  - Status: Working, but out of fuel warning\n  - Neighbours: Wooden Chest, Burner Mining Drill\n  - Function: Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0)\n  - Status: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Fuel: Coal (9 units)\n  - Inventory: Iron Plate (2 units)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Alignment and Fueling\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items between entities. Repeated repositioning indicates potential misalignment.\n- Regularly refuel inserters to prevent them from running out of fuel, which can halt operations.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Operations\n- Check that the furnace is receiving the necessary ingredients to function. The repeated message \"Furnace is not receiving iron ore\" suggests a persistent issue with the supply chain to the furnace.\n\n### Errors with Inventory Management\n- Maintain an adequate supply of necessary resources in your inventory to avoid errors such as \"Could not insert: No coal to insert from your inventory.\" Regularly check and manage inventory levels to ensure smooth operation.\n\n### General Placement Errors\n- Before placing entities, ensure that the target tile is unoccupied and suitable for the intended entity to avoid placement errors."}
