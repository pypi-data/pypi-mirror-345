{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-46.5, -123.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-46.5, -123.5)\n- Pipe Group connecting offshore pump to other entities, starting at position (-46.5, -122.5)\n- Steam Engine at position (-40.5, -113.5), currently not connected to the power network and lacking input liquid\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Site at Position (-15.0, -76.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -76.0), currently out of fuel\n- Wooden Chest at position (-15.5, -77.5) for storing mined iron ore\n- Small Electric Poles around the mining site for potential electricity distribution\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -73.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n- Stone Furnace at position (9.0, -64.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n- Stone Furnace at position (6.0, -62.0) with iron plates in the output\n- Wooden Chest at position (7.5, -61.5) storing iron plates\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) not receiving electricity\n- Small Electric Poles around the production area for potential electricity distribution\n\n### Pipe Networks\nMultiple Pipe Groups are present, with varying fluid systems and statuses, indicating potential future expansions or connections.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities\n- Ensure the target location for placing an entity is clear of obstructions before attempting to place it. This will prevent errors like \"Cannot place boiler at the target location - something is in the way.\"\n\n### Errors with Electricity and Fluid Connections\n- Connect steam engines to the power network and ensure they have input liquid to function properly. Check connections and fluid systems to ensure they are complete and functional.\n\n### Errors with Fuel and Ingredients\n- Keep track of fuel levels in burner mining drills and furnaces to prevent them from running out. Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt, avoiding warnings like \"no ingredients to smelt.\"\n\n### Errors with Inserters and Power\n- Ensure inserters are connected to a power source to avoid them being non-functional due to lack of electricity."}
