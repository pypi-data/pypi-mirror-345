{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nNo structures have been successfully created on the map as of the latest execution steps. The logs indicate attempts to place various entities, but none have been successfully established.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities on non-buildable tiles\n- Ensure that the tile is buildable before attempting to place an entity. The logs indicate multiple attempts to place Stone Furnaces and Wooden Chests on non-buildable positions such as x=21.0 y=21.0, x=25.0 y=25.0, and others.\n\n### Errors when placing entities where no resources are available\n- Verify that there are sufficient resources available to supply the placed entities. For example, there was an attempt to supply coal to a Furnace that was either not placed or had no coal available.\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Check that the target tile is not occupied by another entity before placing a new one. The logs show attempts to place Wooden Chests and Transport Belts at various positions where placement was not possible.\n\n### General Placement Errors\n- Review the environment settings and ensure responsiveness before placing entities. The logs show multiple failed attempts to place entities like Wooden Chests and Transport Belts at various positions, indicating possible issues with the placement logic or environment setup.\n\nBy addressing these errors, the agent can improve its efficiency in building structures and managing resources on the map."}
