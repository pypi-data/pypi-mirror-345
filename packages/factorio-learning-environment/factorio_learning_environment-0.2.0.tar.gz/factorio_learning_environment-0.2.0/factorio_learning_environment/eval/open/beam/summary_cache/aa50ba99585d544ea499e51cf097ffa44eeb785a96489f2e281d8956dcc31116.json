After crafting, we will place it, insert coal and iron ore, and then smelt the iron ore into iron plates.\n\nLet's go through these steps:\n\n1. Craft the stone furnace.\n2. Place the stone furnace at a designated position.\n3. Insert coal as fuel into the furnace.\n4. Insert iron ore into the furnace for smelting.\n5.
