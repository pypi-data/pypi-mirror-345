You SHOULD follow the Google Docstring style.
You SHOULD provide a concise single sentance summary.
You SHOULD include a longer description where appropriate
You SHOULD include a Raises section if appropriate
You SHOULD include a Args section, only if the arguments's name is not descriptive enough to convey it's purpose.
You SHOULD include a Parameters section, only if the parameter's name is not descriptive enough to convey it's purpose.
You SHOULD include a Returns section, only if the function's name is not descriptive enough to convey what is returned.
You SHOULD include a Warns section if appropriate 

When documenting public functionality:
    * You SHOULD provide a valid Example section where appropriate wrapped in markdown python codeblocks.
    * You SHOULD provide a valid Raises section where appropriate which takes into account private function calls.
    * You SHOULD provide a valid Warns section where appropriate which takes into account private function calls.
