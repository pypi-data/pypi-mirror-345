A buffer chest system is intended to smooth coal delivery to the boiler.\n*   Consists of:\n    *   Offshore Pump at (x=-9.5, y=-0.5) supplying water.\n    *   PipeGroup connecting the pump to the boiler (starts at x=-8.5, y=-0.5, status: FULL\\_OUTPUT).\n    *   Boiler at (x=-2.0, y=4.5) heating water to steam. (Status: NO\\_FUEL as of step 118).\n    *   Steam Engine at (x=2.5, y=4.5) consuming steam to generate power. (Status: NOT\\_CONNECTED, no fluid as of step 111).\n    *   PipeGroup connecting the boiler to the steam engine (starts at x=-0.5, y=3.5, status: EMPTY).\n    *   ElectricityGroup distributing power (poles starting from x=2.5, y=6.5).\n    *   Burner Inserter at (x=-1.5, y=6.5) intended to fuel the boiler from a belt (Status: WAITING\\_FOR\\_SOURCE\\_ITEMS as of step 118).\n    *   Wooden Chest at (x=-3.5, y=7.5) acting as a coal buffer (Empty as of step 111).\n    *   Burner Inserter at (x=-2.5, y=7.5) moving coal from the main belt line (at x=-1.5, y=7.5) into the buffer chest (Status: WAITING\\_FOR\\_SOURCE\\_ITEMS as of step 118).\n\n### Coal Mining and Transport at (x="}
