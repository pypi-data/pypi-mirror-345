{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Production Line at (-28, -61)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-28, -61) mining copper ore\n- Stone furnace at (-27, -59) smelting copper plates\n- Burner inserter at (-25.5, -58.5) for output\n- Wooden chest at (-24.5, -58.5) collecting copper plates\n\n### Iron Mining Complex at (-10, -59)\nConsists of three mining drills in a row:\n- Burner mining drill at (-10, -59)\n- Burner mining drill at (-8, -59)\n- Burner mining drill at (-6, -59)\nWith collection chests:\n- Wooden chest at (-9.5, -57.5)\n- Wooden chest at (-7.5, -57.5)\n- Wooden chest at (-5.5, -57.5)\n\n### Iron Smelting Line at (0, 0)\nFour parallel smelting units consisting of:\nFurnaces:\n- Stone furnace at (0, 0)\n- Stone furnace at (2, 0)\n- Stone furnace at (4, 0)\n- Stone furnace at (6, 0)\nInput system:\n- Coal storage chests at (0.5, -2.5), (2.5, -2.5), (4.5, -2.5), (6.5, -2.5)\n- Input inserters at (0.5, -1.5), (2.5, -1.5), (4.5, -1.5), (6.5, -1.5)\nOutput system:\n- Output inserters at (0.5, 1.5), (2.5, 1.5), (4.5, 1.5), (6.5, 1.5)\n- Collection chests at (0.5, 2.5), (2.5, 2.5), (4.5, 2.5), (6.5, 2.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Errors\n- When placing entities next to existing structures, verify there isn't already an entity at the target position\n- Consider using different spacing or direction parameters when placing entities next to existing ones\n\n### Resource Management\n- Mining drills show \"output blocked\" warnings when there's no sink entity in place - ensure output collection is set up before starting mining operations\n\n### Furnace Efficiency\n- Multiple furnaces show \"no ingredients to smelt\" warnings - ensure proper input feed systems are working before starting smelting operations"}
