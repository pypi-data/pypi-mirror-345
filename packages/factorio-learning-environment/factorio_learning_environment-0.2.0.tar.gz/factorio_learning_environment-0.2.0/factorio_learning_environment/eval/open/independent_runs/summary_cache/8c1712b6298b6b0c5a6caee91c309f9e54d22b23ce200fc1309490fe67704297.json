Verify that there are no obstructions or misalignments in the pipe network.\n- Before attempting to connect power poles, ensure that the required items are available in the inventory.\n\n### Crafting and Resource Gathering Errors\n- Gather necessary raw resources such as wood before attempting to craft items that require them as sub-ingredients.\n\n### Code Errors\n- Ensure that all entities are correctly defined and imported in the code. Double-check for any typographical errors in entity names.\n\n### Power Supply Issues\n- Verify that all entities requiring power are connected to a functioning power network. Check the connections and ensure that power poles are correctly placed and connected.\n\n### Assertion Errors\n- Ensure that all entities, such as boilers, have the necessary inputs and are properly connected to the fluid and power networks to function correctly."}
