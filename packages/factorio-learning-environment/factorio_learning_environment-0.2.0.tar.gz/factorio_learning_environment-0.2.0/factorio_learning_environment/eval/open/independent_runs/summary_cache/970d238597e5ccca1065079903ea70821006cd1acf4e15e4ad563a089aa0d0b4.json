Consider extracting items from the inventory to free up space if necessary.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Check that the source inventory has the necessary items available for the inserter to function. Ensure that the inserter is correctly positioned and configured to pick up items from the source.\n\n### Errors with Mining Drills Running Out of Fuel\n- Regularly monitor the fuel levels of mining drills and refuel them as needed to prevent interruptions in resource extraction.\n\n### Errors with Furnaces Having Full Output\n- Regularly extract processed items from furnaces to prevent them from becoming full and halting production. Consider using inserters to automate the extraction process."}
