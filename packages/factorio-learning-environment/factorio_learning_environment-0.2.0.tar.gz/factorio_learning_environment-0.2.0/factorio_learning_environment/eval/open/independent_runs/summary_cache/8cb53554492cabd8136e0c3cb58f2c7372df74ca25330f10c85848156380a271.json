{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (35.5, 27.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (35.5, 27.5)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-7.5, 25.5)\n- Pipes connecting the offshore pump to the steam engine\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nConsists of:\n- Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n- Furnace at position (10.0, 0.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n- Furnace at position (13.0, 0.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n- Furnace at position (16.0, 0.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n- Wooden Chests at positions (8.5, -0.5), (17.5, -0.5), (19.5, -0.5), (20.5, -0.5)\n- Burner Inserters at positions (8.5, 0.5), (17.5, 0.5), (19.5, 0.5), (20.5, 0.5)\n\n### Lab at Position (unknown)\n- Lab with automation science packs but no power\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- Several pipe groups with various positions, all currently empty\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors When Connecting Offshore Pump to Boiler\n- Ensure that the pipe placement does not overlap with water tiles. Adjust the position of pipes to avoid overlaps.\n\n### Errors in Pickup Entity Function\n- When using `pickup_entity(entity)`, ensure that the second argument is a Position object if specified. If the first argument is an Entity object, the second argument must be None.\n- Ensure correct usage of the `pickup_entity` function by specifying the correct arguments as required by the function signature."}
