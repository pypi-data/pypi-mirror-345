The overall belt routing remains incomplete.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 Target and Source Entity Restrictions:\n  - When connecting transport belts, do not target powered entities (e.g. Prototype.Boiler or Prototype.SteamEngine) or use a Wooden Chest directly as a source; always interpose an inserter to mediate item transfer.\n\n\u2022 Belt Connection Normalization:\n  - Ensure that all coordinates are grid aligned and that the path is axis\u2010aligned and monotonic. Fractional or misaligned waypoints lead to \u201cNot a valid path to normalise\u201d errors.\n\n\u2022 Placement Range Verification:\n  - Confirm that target positions are within the allowed placement range relative to the player\u2019s position. Attempts to place entities too far away yield \u201ctarget position is too far\u201d errors.\n\n\u2022 Consistent Connection Strategy:\n  - Use intermediary waypoints that consistently route around interfering infrastructure (e.g. electrical poles) and avoid altering entity types mid-route. Reusing proper inserters at both source and target ends helps prevent connection type conflicts.\n\n\u2022 Inventory and Existence Checks:\n  - Verify that required entities (e.g. wooden chests) are available in the inventory and that retrieval functions are called with correct, verified positions to avoid placement and retrieval errors."}
