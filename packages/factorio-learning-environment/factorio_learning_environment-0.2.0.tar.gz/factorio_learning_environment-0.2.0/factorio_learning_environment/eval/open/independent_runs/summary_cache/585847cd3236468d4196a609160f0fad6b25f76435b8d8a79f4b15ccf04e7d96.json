{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) with a drop position at (41.5, -80.5), connected to a Stone Furnace at position (41.0, -80.0).\n- Wooden Chest at position (43.5, -79.5) for storage.\n\n### Iron Plate Mine at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) with a drop position at (-14.5, -48.5), connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) for storage.\n\n### Copper Furnace at Position (-20.0, -71.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -71.0), currently out of fuel and lacking ingredients to smelt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items without sufficient inventory\n- Ensure that you have the required quantity of items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. For example, attempting to insert coal into the iron furnace failed due to insufficient coal in inventory.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `insert_item`: Used to insert items into entities. Ensure that the source inventory has sufficient items before invoking this function to avoid errors.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `iron_furnace`: Represents the iron furnace entity where items are inserted.\n- `Prototype.Coal`: Represents the coal item prototype used in insertion operations."}
