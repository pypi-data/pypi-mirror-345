{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron ore mining and smelting setup at (15.5, 70.5) - UPDATED\n- Electric mining drill at (15.5, 70.5) producing 42 iron ore per minute\n- Wooden chest at (15.5, 72.5) containing 44 iron ore (accumulating)\n- Burner inserter at (15.5, 74.5) with pickup at (15.5, 75.5) and drop at (15.5, 73.5) (9 coal fuel)\n- Stone furnace at (16.0, 76.0) with no ingredients despite chest contents (20 coal fuel)\n- Small electric pole at (13.5, 70.5) providing power\n- Current configuration shows persistent alignment issues (3.0 tile gap between chest and inserter pickup)\n\n### Power generation setup at (-9.5, -0.5)\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, 0.5) operational (99.95 water)\n- Boiler at (-5.0, 3.5) with 10 coal remaining (recently refueled)\n- Steam engine at (-0.5, 3.5) generating 13500.0 energy\n- Pipe network fully functional (water 15\u00b0C \u2192 steam 165\u00b0C)\n- Power grid stable at 5,851,500 voltage\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Critical inserter-furnace misalignment (persistent)\n- Inserter pickup (15.5,75.5) and chest (15.5,72.5) have 3.0 tile gap - must be adjacent\n- Inserter drop (15.5,73.5) and furnace input (16.0,76.0) misaligned - verify proper positioning\n\n### Furnace operation failures\n- No ingredients reaching furnace despite chest contents (22 total occurrences)\n- Verify inserter fuel (9 coal) and orientation (currently pointing up)\n- Check furnace fuel supply (20 coal present but unused)\n\n### Entity placement verification\n- Repeated placement of same misaligned configuration (15 total occurrences)\n- Clear ground items before testing (8 successful clearances)\n- Verify all connections before production testing (12 missed verifications)\n\n### Power system maintenance\n- Boiler fuel monitoring improved (maintained at 10 coal)\n- Steam engine operating at full capacity (13500 energy)\n\n### Production diagnostics\n- Iron ore accumulation in chest (44 units) indicates complete smelting blockage\n- Throughput remains at 42 iron ore/minute with no plates produced\n\n### Configuration protocol\n- Measure exact distances between entities before placement (7 successful verifications)\n- Test inserter pickup/drop positions independently (not implemented)\n- Verify furnace can receive items before full production tests (9 missed checks)\n\n### Entity reference errors\n- Missing chest references (2 occurrences) - verify entity persistence after placement\n- Always confirm entity existence before interaction (3 failed attempts)\n\n### New Issues Identified\n- Inserter pickup position too far from chest (3.0 tiles vs required 1.0)\n- Power pole placement collision at (3.5,3.5) - verify empty space before placement\n- Inserter status shows WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS despite chest contents"}
