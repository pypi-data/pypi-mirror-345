Overlapping burner\u2011inserters and misaligned transport belts around the boiler at (8.0, 20.5) \u2013 with even nearby clear points (e.g. (8.5, 22.5)) obstructed by remnants of previous placements \u2013 impede its installation.\n  - Manual intervention is required: reassess the boiler area and its adjoining connection interfaces; remove, reposition, or adjust the interfering entities to create a clear, buildable zone; or consider relocating the extra steam engine or modifying the boiler layout to secure sufficient clearance.\n\n\u2022 Fuel Supply and Connectivity Warnings in Burner\u2011Powered Entities\n  - Numerous burner\u2011inserters and the burner\u2011mining drill consistently report \u201cout of fuel\u201d or \u201cwaiting for source items.\u201d\n  - Ensure that fuel sources are positioned immediately adjacent to these machines and confirm that transport belt routing is unobstructed for timely fuel delivery.\n\n\u2022 Steam Engine Connectivity and Fluid Input Deficiencies\n  - Several steam engines display warnings about not being connected to the power network and lacking input liquid or proper fluid connections.\n  - Review and reconfigure the electrical wiring and fluid pipelines to establish a robust network and guarantee continuous fuel and fluid supply.\n\n\u2022 Laboratory Power Instability\n  - The Automation Research Lab remains affected by unstable power connectivity.\n  - Inspect the surrounding electrical infrastructure (including pole placements and wiring) and make the necessary adjustments to restore stable power to the lab."}
