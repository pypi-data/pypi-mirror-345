Historical fluid_system values (85867, 85951, 86033, 86117, 86199, 86283, 86365, 86449; 86531, 86615, 86697, 86781, 86863, 86947, 87029, 87113) and recent attempts (87195, 87279, 87361, 87445, 87527, 87611, 87693, 87777) yielded no candidates. Ensure that the designated fluid_system identifiers align with those assigned in the pipeline network and that candidate pipe groups are positioned within the effective search radius.\n- Search Radius and Entity Placement:\n  - Verify that the search radius is broad enough to capture nearby pipe groups and that entities are accurately positioned to allow successful connections.\n- Inventory Parameter Consistency:\n  - Use supported inventory parameters for inventory operations to prevent errors arising from attribute mismatches."}
