{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-20.0, -70.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -70.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-18.0, -70.0) working with iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -65.0) working with iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-21.0, -62.0) working with iron ore.\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) connected to a transport belt network.\n- Transport belts connecting the mining drill to the furnaces.\n- Burner Inserters at positions (-20.5, -66.5) and (-17.5, -64.5) moving items between belts and furnaces.\n- Wooden Chests at positions (-23.5, -69.5), (-24.5, -67.5), (-16.5, -64.5), and (-20.5, -63.5) for storage.\n\n### Iron Ore Extraction Site at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Transport belts moving extracted ore to a wooden chest at position (-12.5, -54.5).\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5) transferring items from the belt to the chest.\n\n### Coal Mining Operation at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) extracting coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5) storing coal.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage Facility at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) producing iron plates.\n- Wooden Chests at positions (1.5, 0.5) and (3.5, 0.5) for storing coal, iron ore, and iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) transferring items between chests.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entities for inserters have available items to transfer. Check the inventory of source entities and ensure they are not empty.\n\n### Errors with Furnaces Lacking Ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Regularly supply furnaces with required materials to maintain production efficiency.\n\n### Errors with Belt Connections\n- Verify that transport belts are correctly aligned and connected to ensure smooth transfer of resources between entities."}
