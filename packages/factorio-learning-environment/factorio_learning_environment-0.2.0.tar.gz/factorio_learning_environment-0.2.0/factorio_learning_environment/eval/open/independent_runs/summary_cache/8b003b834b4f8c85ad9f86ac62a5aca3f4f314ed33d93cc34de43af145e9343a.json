{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Wooden Chest at position(41.5, -80.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest (position(41.5, -80.5)) with an inventory containing 13 coal.\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position(41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position(41.0, -82.0)) which is currently working and extracting coal. It has a fuel inventory containing 11 coal. It is connected to the wooden chest at position(41.5, -80.5) for resource drop-off.\n\n### Stone Furnace at position(-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace (position(-15.0, -50.0)) which is currently out of fuel and has an inventory with 27 iron ore and 100 iron plates.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n- **Errors when inserting fuel into the furnace while it is out of fuel**\n  - Ensure that the furnace has enough fuel before attempting to insert resources for smelting.\n  \n- **Errors when the chest at drop position is full**\n  - Empty the chest at (41.5, -80.5) to continue mining. Ensure that the drop position has sufficient capacity for incoming resources.\n\n- **Errors when the furnace result is full**\n  - Monitor the output inventory of the furnace and ensure it has space to accept new products before inserting resources.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- **Utility Functions Defined:**\n  - None reported.\n\n- **Important Variables Assigned:**\n  - `wood`: int\n  - `coal`: int\n  - `iron-ore`: int\n  - `iron-plate`: int\n  - `furnace_source`: Inventory\n  - `furnace_result`: Inventory\n\nNo utility functions have been invoked, and no success or failure modes are reported."}
