{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-14.0, -49.0)\nThis facility is responsible for producing iron plates from iron ore using a stone furnace. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-14.0, -49.0): This furnace is fueled with coal and processes iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -47.5): This inserter transfers iron plates from the stone furnace to the wooden chest. It is fueled with coal and is currently operational.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-13.5, -46.5): This chest stores the iron plates produced by the furnace.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure the target tile is unoccupied and suitable for the entity being placed. Persistent placement issues indicate potential conflicts with existing entities or terrain restrictions.\n\n### Errors during crafting\n- Iron plates cannot be crafted directly; they require smelting in a furnace. Ensure that crafting recipes are compatible with available machines or furnaces.\n\n### Validation errors for entity dimensions\n- Ensure that the dimensions provided for entities like the Stone Furnace are valid integers. Incorrect dimensions can lead to placement or operational errors."}
