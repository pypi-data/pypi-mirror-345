{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (35.5, 23.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (35.5, 23.5)\n- Boiler (position not specified, but connected to steam engine)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-7.5, 25.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with a burner inserter at position (8.5, 0.5) for iron ore input\n- Furnace at position (10.0, 0.0) with a burner inserter at position (17.5, 0.5) for iron ore input\n- Furnace at position (13.0, 0.0) with a burner inserter at position (19.5, 0.5) for iron ore input\n- Furnace at position (16.0, 0.0) with a burner inserter at position (20.5, 0.5) for iron ore input\n\n### Storage Area\nConsists of:\n- Wooden Chests at positions (8.5, -0.5), (17.5, -0.5), (19.5, -0.5), (20.5, -0.5), and (8.5, 1.5)\n\n### Pipe Network\nConsists of multiple pipe groups connecting various entities, including:\n- PipeGroup at position (-0.5, 11.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (5.5, 18.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (18.5, 21.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (22.5, 20.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (-8.5, 23.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (-0.5, 22.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (2.5, 23.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (14.5, 22.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (29.5, 23.5)\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of:\n- Small Electric Poles connecting various entities, including a pole at position (33.5, 24.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Crafting Small Electric Poles\n- Ensure you have the required sub-ingredients, such as copper plates, before attempting to craft small electric poles. Copper plates need to be smelted in a furnace.\n\n### Errors when Connecting Steam Engine to Power Network\n- Verify that you have the necessary items, such as small electric poles, in your inventory before attempting to connect the steam engine to the power network.\n\n### Errors when Extracting Copper Plates\n- Make sure there is a valid entity containing copper plates before attempting to extract them.\n\n### Offshore Pump Not Working\n- Investigate the connections and ensure there is a fluid present in the connections for the offshore pump to function properly.\n\n### Steam Engine Not Working\n- Check the connections and ensure that the steam engine is properly connected to both the boiler and the power network, and that there is a sufficient supply of water and fuel.\n\n### Errors when Placing Pipes\n- Ensure that the target location for placing pipes is clear of existing objects to avoid placement errors."}
