Check if the source is empty or blocked.\n\n### Errors with Transport Belts Not Found\n- Verify that the transport belts are placed correctly at the specified positions. Ensure that they are not removed or misplaced.\n\n### Warnings of No Ingredients to Smelt in Furnaces\n- Make sure that the furnaces have the necessary ingredients to process. Check the supply chain to ensure continuous input of resources.\n\n### Warnings of Full Chests Blocking Mining Drills\n- Regularly empty the chests at the drop positions of mining drills to prevent them from becoming full and halting operations."}
