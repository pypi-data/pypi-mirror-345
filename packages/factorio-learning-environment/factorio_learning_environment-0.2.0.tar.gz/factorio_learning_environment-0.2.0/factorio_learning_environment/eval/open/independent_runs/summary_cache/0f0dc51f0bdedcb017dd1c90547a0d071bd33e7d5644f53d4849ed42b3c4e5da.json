{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with fuel inventory of coal and smelting iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=1.5, y=0.5) transferring iron plates from the furnace to a wooden chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=2.5, y=0.5) storing iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=3.5, y=0.5) extracting items from the wooden chest and placing them onto a transport belt.\n- **Transport Belt Group** connecting the chest inserter to the second burner inserter, consisting of:\n  - Belt from (x=3.5, y=0.5) to (x=5.5, y=0.5) and (x=4.5, y=0.5) to (x=6.5, y=0.5).\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=6.5, y=0.5) transferring iron plates from the transport belt to another wooden chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=7.5, y=0.5) collecting iron plates from the belt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Ensure there is enough space and no existing entities at the desired position before placing a new entity. Adjust spacing or direction if necessary.\n\n### Errors when connecting transport belts directly from chests\n- Use an inserter to extract items from a chest before connecting them to a transport belt. Direct connections from chests to belts are not possible.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient inventory items\n- Verify that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to place or craft them. Gather necessary resources beforehand.\n\n### Errors when crafting items with unavailable sub-ingredients\n- Ensure all sub-ingredients are available in your inventory before crafting an item. For example, gather wood manually as it cannot be crafted.\n\n### Errors when inserting items with insufficient inventory\n- Check your inventory to ensure you have the items available to insert into other entities."}
