{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=1.5, y=23.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\n- Pipe Group (steam) connecting various positions from (x=3.5, y=17.5) to (x=10.5, y=21.5)\n- Pipe Group (water) connecting various positions from (x=-9.5, y=23.5) to (x=-0.5, y=23.5)\n- Electricity Group with poles at various positions including (x=3.5, y=20.5), (x=14.5, y=20.5), and others\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting pipes\n- Ensure that the pipes are correctly aligned and connected between the boiler and steam engine. Check the positions and directions of the pipes to avoid connection failures.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
