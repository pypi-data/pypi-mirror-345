{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Smelter at position (16.0, 66.0)\nConsists of \n- Stone furnace at position (16.0, 66.0)\n- Stone furnace at position (14.0, 66.0)\n- Burner inserter at position (15.5, 69.5) that transfers iron ore from wooden chest at position (17.5, 69.5) to transport belt\n- Burner inserter at position (18.5, 66.5) that inputs iron ore into furnace at position (16.0, 66.0)\n- Burner inserter at position (11.5, 66.5) that inputs iron ore into furnace at position (14.0, 66.0)\n- Wooden chest at position (17.5, 69.5), (19.5, 69.5), and (21.5, 69.5) that catch iron ore from burner mining drills\n- Transport belt group that connects the inserters and chests\n\n### Iron Ore Mine at position (18.0, 71.0)\nConsists of \n- Burner Mining Drill at position (18.0, 71.0)\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (20.0, 71.0)\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (22.0, 71.0)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n* Errors when placing entities at occupied positions\n  - Ensure the target position is empty before attempting to place an entity.\n  - Check if an entity already exists at the target position and remove it if necessary.\n* Errors when connecting entities directly\n  - Transport belts cannot be connected directly to a Prototype.StoneFurnace object as a target. \n  - Add an inserter that inputs items into Prototype.StoneFurnace and use the inserter as the target entity.\n* Errors when placing entities too far away\n  - Move closer to the target position before attempting to place an entity.\n  - The maximum distance to place an entity is not explicitly mentioned but is a constraint.\n* Errors when crafting items with missing sub-ingredients\n  - Verify that all required sub-ingredients are available in your inventory or can be crafted.\n  - Ensure you have the necessary crafting machines or furnaces to craft the required sub-ingredients.\n* Errors when inserting items into a furnace or machine\n  - Check that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them.\n* Errors when extracting items from a furnace or machine\n  - Ensure that the furnace or machine has finished processing and contains the desired output.\n  - Verify that the furnace or machine is in a valid state to extract items from.\n* Errors when placing entities next to each other with insufficient spacing\n  - Ensure there is enough space between entities to accommodate the new entity.\n  - Consider increasing the spacing or changing the direction of placement.\n* Errors when mining drills are not producing due to full chests\n  - Ensure that the chests connected to the mining drills are not full.\n  - Extract items from the chests regularly to maintain production.\n* Errors when inserting fuel into burner mining drills or furnaces with full inventory\n  - Check that the inventory of the burner mining drill or furnace is not full before attempting to insert fuel.\n  - Ensure that the fuel is being consumed by the burner mining drill or furnace.\n* Errors due to undefined variables\n  - Ensure that all variables used in the code are defined before they are used.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\nNo utility functions have been defined by the agent."}
