Earlier failures involved fluid_system identifiers [138323, 138407, 138489, 138573, 138655, 138739, 138821, 138905] and [138987, 139071, 139153, 139237, 139319, 139403, 139485, 139569]. The latest attempts targeted fluid_system IDs [139651, 139735, 139817, 139901, 139983, 140067, 140149, 140233].\n  - Tip: Verify that pipe groups with the intended fluid_system identifiers exist within the 15-tile search radius. Adjust the search radius or pipeline network configuration as needed to align the designated fluid_system values with available candidates."}
