{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-9.5, 24.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Boiler at position (-2.5, 24.0)\n- Steam Engine at position (-5.5, 19.5)\n- Pipe Group connecting the offshore pump and boiler, with segments at positions (-4.5, 16.5) and (-9.5, 23.5)\n- Electricity Group with small electric poles connecting various points, including:\n  - Small Electric Pole at x=-5.5 y=25.5 connected to steam engine at x=-5.5 y=19.5\n  - Small Electric Pole at x=-7.5 y=15.5 connected to network at x=-6.5 y=16.5\n  - Small Electric Pole at x=-3.5 y=22.5 connected to network at x=-7.5 y=15.5\n  - Small Electric Pole at x=-4.5 y=22.5 connected to network at x=-3.5 y=22.5\n  - Small Electric Pole at x=-3.5 y=20.5 connected to network at x=-4.5 y=22.5\n  - Small Electric Pole at x=-3.5 y=19.5 connected to network at x=-3.5 y=20.5\n  - Small Electric Pole at x=-1.5 y=18.5 connected directly to the steam engine at x=-5.5 y=19.5\n  - Small Electric Pole at x=-1.5 y=22.5 connected directly to the steam engine at x=-5.5 y=19.5\n  - Small Electric Pole at x=-3.5 y=21.5 connected to network at x=-1.5 y=22.5\n  - Small Electric Pole at x=-0.5 y=21.5 connected to network at x=-3.5 y=21.5\n  - Small Electric Pole at x=1.5 y=18.5 connected to network at x=-0.5 y=21.5\n\n### Stone Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) currently has no ingredients.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors when placing small electric poles\n- Ensure there is no overlap with water or other entities when placing small electric poles. Attempt placement in a different location if necessary.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient inventory\n- Check your inventory to ensure you have the required items before attempting to place or connect entities.\n\n### Errors in connecting pipes\n- Ensure that the pipes are correctly aligned and connected between the intended entities to avoid connection failures.\n\n### Errors in connecting electric poles\n- Verify that the electric poles are within range to connect to each other and the network. Ensure all poles are properly connected to the electric network."}
