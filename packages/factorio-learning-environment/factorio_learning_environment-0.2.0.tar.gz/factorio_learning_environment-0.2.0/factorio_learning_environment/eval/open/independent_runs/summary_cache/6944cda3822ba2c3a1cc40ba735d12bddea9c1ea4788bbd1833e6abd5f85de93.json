{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, -60.0) with a drop position at (4.5, -58.5). It is currently working with 20 units of coal as fuel and has a warning indicating the chest at the drop position is full.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (5.5, -60.5), (4.5, -58.5), and (4.5, -56.5) for storing mined resources. The chest at (4.5, -58.5) contains 10 units of iron ore, while the chest at (4.5, -56.5) contains 641 units of iron ore.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (-15.0, -48.0), (-13.0, -48.0), and (-11.0, -48.0) for processing iron ore into iron plates. These furnaces are working with coal as fuel and have varying amounts of iron ore and iron plates in their inventories.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Wooden Chests** and **Iron Chests** at various positions for storing iron plates. Notable positions include (5.5, -60.5), (7.5, -60.5), (6.5, -60.5), (9.5, -60.5), (8.5, -60.5), (-16.5, -54.5), (-17.5, -54.5), (-14.5, -54.5), (-15.5, -54.5), (-13.5, -54.5), (-4.5, -52.5), (-5.5, -52.5), (-3.5, -52.5), (-2.5, -52.5), (-14.5, -50.5), (-13.5, -50.5), (-12.5, -50.5), (-11.5, -50.5), (-10.5, -50.5), (-9.5, -50.5), (-8.5, -50.5), (-7.5, -50.5), (-6.5, -50.5), (-5.5, -50.5). These chests contain varying amounts of iron plates, with some being empty.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when extracting resources\n- Ensure that the target chest or entity from which you want to extract resources is not full or otherwise obstructed. The chest at position (4.5, -58.5) is full, preventing further extraction.\n\n### Errors when transferring resources\n- Verify that the source chest or entity has sufficient resources to transfer. Multiple attempts to transfer iron ore from the chest at (4.5, -56.5) to furnaces failed due to insufficient resources.\n\n### Errors with full storage\n- Regularly check and empty storage chests to prevent mining operations from halting due to full storage, as indicated by the warning on the burner mining drill.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- No specific variables have been assigned or highlighted in the provided logs."}
