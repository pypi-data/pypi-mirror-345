{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -49.0) used for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (40.0, -84.0) with a fuel inventory of coal, extracting coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (40.5, -82.5) storing extracted coal, currently full.\n- Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -83.5) for additional storage, currently empty.\n- BeltGroup connecting various positions to transport coal, with belts at positions such as (50.5, -86.5) to (48.5, -86.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Storage\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Iron Chest at position (0.5, 0.5) storing iron plates.\n- Iron Chest at position (1.5, 0.5) for additional storage, currently empty.\n\n### Coal Distribution System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Inserter at position (54.5, -83.5) transferring coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (41.5, -80.5) transferring coal.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Crafting Electronic Circuits\n- Ensure all required materials are available in the inventory before attempting to craft electronic circuits. The crafting process failed multiple times due to missing ingredients.\n\n### Errors in Crafting Iron Gear Wheels\n- Verify that the necessary materials, specifically iron plates, are available in sufficient quantities before crafting iron gear wheels. Attempts to craft iron gear wheels failed due to missing materials.\n\n### Errors when Using Extracting but Being Too Far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items."}
