{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line (x=1-5, y=1-3.5)\nConsists of three parallel smelting setups:\n- Furnace (x=1, y=1) with burner inserter (x=1.5, y=2.5) outputting to chest (x=1.5, y=3.5)\n- Furnace (x=3, y=1) with burner inserter (x=3.5, y=2.5) outputting to chest (x=3.5, y=3.5)\n- Empty furnace setup with burner inserter (x=5.5, y=2.5) outputting to chest (x=5.5, y=3.5)\n\n### Copper Plate Production Line (x=2-4.5, y=7-9.5)\nConsists of two parallel smelting setups:\n- Furnace (x=2, y=7) with burner inserter (x=2.5, y=8.5) outputting to chest (x=2.5, y=9.5)\n- Furnace (x=4, y=7) with burner inserter (x=4.5, y=8.5) outputting to chest (x=4.5, y=9.5)\n\n### Copper Cable Production Line (x=11.5-14.5, y=11.5-14.5)\nConsists of:\n- Input chest (x=14.5, y=11.5) containing copper plates\n- Burner inserter (x=14.5, y=12.5) feeding assembling machine\n- Assembling machine (x=14.5, y=14.5) producing copper cable\n- Output burner inserter (x=12.5, y=14.5) moving cables to storage chest (x=11.5, y=14.5)\n\n### Power Generation System (x=-5.5-13.5, y=26.5-35.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump (x=2.5, y=35.5) extracting water\n- Pipe network connecting pump to boiler\n- Boiler (x=7, y=35.5) converting water to steam\n- Steam engine (x=13.5, y=35.5) generating electricity\n- Electricity distribution network with multiple electric poles\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Research-related errors\n- Check if a technology is already researched before attempting to research it again\n- Use appropriate API calls to verify research status before setting new research\n\n### Assembly Machine Operation\n- Ensure consistent supply of ingredients to prevent ITEM_INGREDIENT_SHORTAGE status\n- Monitor output storage capacity to prevent FULL_OUTPUT status\n\n### Fluid System Setup\n- Some offshore pumps are not connected properly to the fluid network (warnings about no fluid present)\n- Ensure proper connection of all fluid-carrying entities through pipes\n\n### Resource Management\n- Multiple furnaces are idle due to lack of ingredients\n- Implement better resource distribution system to keep production lines active"}
