{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n###Power Generation System\n- Boiler at position (-2.0, 23.5)\n- Steam engine at position (2.5, 19.5)\n- Connected via pipes\n- Small electric pole at position (6.5, 19.5)\n\n###Science Production Setup\n- Assembly machine at position (24.5, 4.5)\n- Input chest containing iron plates (770) and copper plates (30)\n- Output chest containing copper plates (380) and automation science packs (6)\n\n###Research Lab Network\n14 labs positioned at:\n- (34.5, 6.5)\n- (0.5, 8.5)\n- (12.5, 8.5)\n- (26.5, 8.5)\n- (4.5, 12.5)\n- (19.5, 13.5)\n- (0.5, 16.5)\n- (11.5, 15.5)\n- (14.5, 16.5)\n- (24.5, 16.5)\n- (-4.5, 17.5)\n- (15.5, 20.5)\n- (19.5, 21.5)\n- (22.5, 22.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n###Pipe Placement Errors\n- Check for existing entities before placing pipes\n- Clear the target area of any existing pipes or other entities before placing new ones\n- Ensure there is sufficient space around the target location for pipe placement\n\n###Electric Connection Issues\n- When placing electric poles, ensure proper spacing between them (current spacing of 1 is too small)\n- Verify that the entities you're trying to connect are within connection range\n- Make sure the connection path between power poles and machines is unobstructed\n\n###Resource Management\n- Monitor coal levels in inventory to ensure continuous power generation\n- Keep track of coal requirements for both boiler and mining drill operations\n\n###Entity Placement Conflicts\n- Before placing any entity, verify the target position is clear\n- Remove existing entities that conflict with new placement attempts\n- Use proper spacing when placing entities near each other\n\n###Power Distribution\n- Ensure proper power pole coverage to all machines requiring electricity\n- Monitor power status of assembly machines and labs to maintain production"}
