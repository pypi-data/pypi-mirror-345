{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-13.5, 20.0)\nConsists of:\n- Boiler (position -13.5, 20.0)\n- Offshore pump (position -13.5, 20.0)\n- Steam engine (position -13.5, 20.0)\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(-18.0, -49.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (position -18.0, -49.0) and a furnace (position -18.0, -49.0)\n\n### Copper cable factory at position(-16.5, 20.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine (position -16.5, 20.5) and inserter (position -16.5, 20.5) that puts into the assembling machine\n- Beltgroup (position -16.5, 20.5) that connects the furnace at position -18.0, -49.0 to the assembling machine at position -16.5, 20.5\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to entity placement\n- Ensure the target location is clear before attempting to place an entity. The error \"Cannot place boiler at the target location - something is in the way\" indicates that there is an obstruction at the intended placement site.\n  \n### Errors when managing entities\n- When attempting to manage entities (like retrieving or placing), ensure that the entities are powered and accessible. Errors such as \"Lab is still not powered\" and \"Assembling machine is still not powered\" suggest that power connections are not properly established.\n\n### Errors when removing entities\n- Verify that the entity you are trying to remove is indeed removable. The message \"Skipping removal for non-removable entity type\" indicates that the entity cannot be removed, so check the entity type before attempting removal."}
