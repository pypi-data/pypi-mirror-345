The new stone furnace at (0.0, 0.0) is operational, processing the remaining iron ore and has ample wood as fuel.\n2. The existing furnace at (-1.0, 2.0) has wood but no ingredients to smelt.\n3. The last furnace at (1.0, 2.0) is out of fuel and has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Next Steps\nNow that we have 6 iron plates, we can proceed to craft the Assembling Machine 1, which requires:\n- 3 iron plates\n- 1 iron gear wheel\n\nWe have sufficient materials to craft the Assembling Machine 1. Let's proceed with the crafting.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Craft the Assembling Machine 1 using the available resources (6 iron plates and 1 iron gear wheel)\ncraft_item(Prototype.AssemblingMachine1, quantity=1)  # Crafting one assembling machine\nprint(f\"Inventory after crafting assembling machine: {inspect_inventory()}\")  # Check inventory after crafting the machine", "summary_range": "[1-122]"}
