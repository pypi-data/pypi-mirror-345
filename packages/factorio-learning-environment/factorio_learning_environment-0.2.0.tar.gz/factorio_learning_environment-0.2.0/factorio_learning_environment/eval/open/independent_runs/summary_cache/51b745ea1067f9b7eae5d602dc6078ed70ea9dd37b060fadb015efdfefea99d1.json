{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Plate Production Facility at position (x=2.0, y=-63.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner mining drill** at position (x=2.0, y=-63.0) for extracting iron ore.\n- **Stone furnace** at position (x=4.0, y=-63.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner inserter** at position (x=3.5, y=-61.5) for transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Wooden chest** at position (x=2.5, y=-61.5) for storing iron ore extracted by the drill.\n- **Wooden chest** at position (x=4.5, y=-61.5) for storing iron plates produced by the furnace.\n\n#### Additional Stone Furnace at position (x=6.0, y=-63.0)\n- **Stone furnace** at position (x=6.0, y=-63.0) currently idle due to lack of ingredients.\n\n---\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when extracting from empty chests\n- Ensure the chest has items before attempting to extract. Repeatedly extracting from an empty chest wastes actions and time.\n\n#### Errors when furnaces run out of ingredients\n- Monitor the input inventory of furnaces to ensure they always have sufficient raw materials (e.g., iron ore) to operate continuously.\n\n#### Errors when drills run out of fuel\n- Regularly check and refuel burner mining drills to avoid interruptions in resource extraction.\n\n#### Errors when inserters wait for source items\n- Ensure inserters have a steady supply of items to transfer. If the source chest is empty, address the upstream production issue (e.g., refuel drills or ensure drills are operational).\n\n#### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Always verify that the target tile is free before placing an entity to avoid placement failures.\n\n#### Errors when harvesting resources too far away\n- Move closer to the resource node before attempting to harvest to ensure the action is successful."}
