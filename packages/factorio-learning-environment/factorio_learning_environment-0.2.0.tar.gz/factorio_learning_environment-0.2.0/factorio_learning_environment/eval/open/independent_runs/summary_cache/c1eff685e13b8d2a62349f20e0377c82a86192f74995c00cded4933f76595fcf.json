This structure supports the production of intermediate components and supplies the resources needed for higher-tier crafting.\n\n### Copper Smelting Furnace at Position(-27.0, -60.0)\nConsists of a furnace entity dedicated to turning harvested copper ore into copper plates. These copper plates are subsequently used for crafting copper cables and other copper-based components.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 When calling get_entities, avoid using keyword arguments (e.g. \"radius\") or supplying a mismatched number of positional arguments. Always verify the expected signature to prevent TypeErrors.\n\u2022 Ensure that the return value from get_entities is valid and iterable before processing it. Use an empty list fallback if the function returns None.\n\u2022 Before attempting to place any structure (such as a Lab), confirm that the required item exists in inventory to avoid placement errors.\n\u2022 When crafting complex structures like a Lab, verify that all sub-ingredients (for example, iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, and copper-cables) are sufficiently available. Strengthen upstream production lines to meet these requirements.\n\u2022 Address recurring crafting failures by closely managing resource production and intermediate component supply to ultimately satisfy the recipe demands."}
