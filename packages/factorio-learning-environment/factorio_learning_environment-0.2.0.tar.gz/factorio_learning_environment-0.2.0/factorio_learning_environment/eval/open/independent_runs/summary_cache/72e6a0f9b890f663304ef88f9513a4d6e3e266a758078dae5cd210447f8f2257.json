{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-68.5, -95.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position (-68.5, -95.5)\n- Boiler at position (-46.5, -122.0)\n- Steam engine at position (-59.5, -111.5)\n- Connected pipes forming a network from the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -76.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at position (-15.0, -76.0) with an iron chest at position (-15.5, -77.5)\n- Stone furnace at position (-19.0, -73.0) for smelting iron ore\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace at position (9.0, -64.0) for smelting copper ore\n\n### Inserter and Storage System\nConsists of:\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5)\n- Wooden chest at position (7.5, -61.5) and another at position (6.5, -59.5)\n- Stone furnace at position (6.0, -62.0)\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of:\n- Multiple small electric poles at various positions including (5.5, -60.5), (7.5, -60.5), (8.5, -61.5), and others to distribute electricity\n\n### Pipe Networks\nConsists of multiple pipe groups at various positions, facilitating fluid transport across different areas\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities\n- Ensure the target location is clear before placing an entity. Attempting to place a small electric pole at (8.5, -62.0) failed because the location was obstructed.\n\n### Errors in Function Calls\n- When using functions that require positional arguments, ensure the correct data type is provided. A `ValueError` occurred due to an incorrect argument type in the `pickup_entity` function. Always pass a `Position` object as the second argument.\n\n### Errors Related to Power Supply\n- Ensure that all electrical entities are connected to a power network. The inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) is not receiving electricity, indicating a possible disconnection or lack of power supply."}
