{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Furnace at position (4, -62)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position (4, -62)) with 49 coal and 6 iron ore in its inventory, currently producing iron plates.\n\n### Lab at position (0.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab (position (0.5, 0.5)) which requires power to operate and is currently not powered.\n\n### Electricity Group\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Small electric pole (position (2.5, 0.5))\n- Small electric pole (position (3.5, 0.5))\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(x)\nConsists of following entities\n- Burner mining drill (position x1) and a furnace at position(y1)\n- Burner mining drill (position x2) and a furnace at position(y2)\n- Burner mining drill (position x3) and a furnace at position(y3)\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of following entities\n- Burner mining drill (position x1) and a furnace at position(y1)\n- Assembling machine at position(z1) and inserter at position(a) that puts into assembling machine\n- Beltgroup (position ) that connects the furnace at position y1 to assembling machine at position(z1)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items into a full inventory\n- Ensure that the target entity has enough space in its inventory before attempting to insert items. In this case, the furnace was full when trying to add coal.\n\n### Errors related to power supply\n- Check that all structures requiring power, such as the Lab, are connected to a power source. The Lab at position (0.5, 0.5) is currently not powered.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items. \n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
