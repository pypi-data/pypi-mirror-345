{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Setup at Position (2.0, -63.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (2.0, -63.0) for extracting iron ore.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (4.0, -63.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (3.5, -61.5) for transferring items between the drill, chest, and furnace.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (2.5, -61.5) for storing iron ore before smelting.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (4.5, -61.5) for storing iron plates after smelting.\n\n#### Additional Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -63.0)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (6.0, -63.0) is currently idle due to lack of ingredients.\n\n---\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when inserting items into a furnace\n- Ensure the furnace has enough space and the correct input items before attempting to insert. For example, inserting iron ore into a furnace that is already full or smelting another item will fail.\n\n#### Errors when extracting items from a furnace\n- Verify that the furnace contains the desired item before attempting extraction. For example, extracting iron plates from a furnace that has not yet produced any will result in an error.\n\n#### Errors with inserter operations\n- Ensure the inserter has a valid source and destination. For example, if the chest is full or the source entity has no items, the inserter will fail to transfer items.\n\n#### Errors with fuel management\n- Always check the fuel levels of burner entities (e.g., mining drills, furnaces, and inserters) to ensure they have enough coal to operate. Running out of fuel will halt operations.\n\n#### Errors with entity placement\n- Avoid placing entities in occupied tiles or overlapping positions. Always verify the tile is free before placing a new entity.\n\n#### Errors with inventory management\n- Ensure the agent's inventory has enough space before attempting to extract or add items. Overfilling the inventory can lead to errors in item handling."}
