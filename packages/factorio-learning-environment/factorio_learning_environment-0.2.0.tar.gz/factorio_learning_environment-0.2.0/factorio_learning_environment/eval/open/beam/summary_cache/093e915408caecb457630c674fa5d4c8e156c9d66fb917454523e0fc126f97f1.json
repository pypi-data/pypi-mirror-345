{"content": "The latest monitoring of the stone furnace has produced the following results:\n\n### New Stone Furnace Output Status:\n- **Current Inventory**: The furnace is completely **empty** again, with no products produced after the extended waiting period.\n- **Current Fuel**: The furnace still shows **3 pieces of coal remaining**.\n- **Energy Status**: The energy remains at **1600.0 units**, indicating the furnace is operational.\n- **Status**: The furnace displays **\"NO INGREDIENTS,\"** confirming that it is not processing the Copper Ore as expected.\n\n### Overall Inventory Overview:\n- **Total Inventory**:\n  - **11 pieces of stone furnaces**.\n  - **3 pieces of coal remaining**.\n  - **1 piece of stone** available.\n  - **5 pieces of iron ore** available.\n  - **21 pieces of iron plates** available.\n\n### Observations:\n- The furnace continues to indicate that it has no ingredients to smelt, despite having Copper Ore loaded previously.\n- This ongoing issue suggests that there may be a fundamental problem with how the furnace is configured or how it recognizes the smelting recipes.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Check Furnace Configuration**: I will need to confirm the recipe configuration of the stone furnace to ensure it is set to smelt Copper Ore.\n2. **Consider Alternative Solutions**: If the furnace remains unresponsive, I may need to explore using a different furnace type or check for any potential mods or settings that might be affecting its functionality.\n3. **Rebuild the Furnace**: If necessary, I will dismantle and rebuild the furnace again, ensuring that it is properly configured for Copper Ore smelting.\n\nLet's first check the recipe configuration of the new stone furnace to ensure it can smelt Copper Ore. \n\"\"\"\n\n# Check the recipe configuration of the new stone furnace to ensure it can smelt Copper Ore\nrecipe_status = get_prototype_recipe(Prototype.StoneFurnace)  # Confirming what recipe is configured for the furnace\nprint(f\"Recipe Status of the new Stone Furnace: {recipe_status}\")  # Display the configured recipe status.", "summary_range": "[1-440]"}
