{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll generate a comprehensive report:\n\n# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Transport System (around x=41-45, y=-80 to -83)\nComplex automated coal mining and transport system consisting of:\n- Burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0) mining coal\n- Two storage chests:\n  - Iron chest at (41.5, -83.5) storing 1600 coal\n  - Wooden chest at (41.5, -80.5) storing coal from mining drill\n- Transport system:\n  - Burner inserter at (42.5, -80.5) facing RIGHT, moving coal from wooden chest to belt\n  - Transport belt at (43.5, -80.5) facing RIGHT\n- Stone furnace at (45.0, -81.0)\n\n### Iron Plate Storage (around x=47-50, y=-80)\n- Stone furnace at (47.0, -81.0)\n- Wooden chest at (49.5, -80.5) containing 1500 iron plates\n\n### Transport Belt System\n- Belt group running from (42.5, -68.5) to (42.5, -77.5)\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Conflicts\n- Before placing entities, ensure the target location is clear of other entities\n- Multiple attempts to place burner-inserter failed due to existing objects at:\n  - (44.5, -80.5)\n  - (44.5, -81.5)\n  - (44.5, -81.0)\n\n### Transport System Issues\n- Transport belt blocking issues detected - ensure belts are clear before attempting to transport items\n- When fixing transport systems, remove conflicting entities before placing new ones\n- Pay attention to inserter orientation - multiple attempts needed to get correct facing direction\n\n### Entity Orientation\n- Verify inserter pickup and drop positions match the intended transport flow\n- When placing inserters, consider the entire material flow path to ensure proper orientation\n\n# NAMESPACE\n\n### Important Variables\n- `furnace_inserter`: BurnerInserter\n- `belt_right`: TransportBelt\n- `chest_inserter`: BurnerInserter\n\n### System Status Indicators\n- EntityStatus.WORKING: Indicates properly functioning entities\n- EntityStatus.WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION: Indicates blocked output\n- EntityStatus.NO_INGREDIENTS: Indicates input supply issues\n- EntityStatus.WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS: Indicates input supply issues"}
