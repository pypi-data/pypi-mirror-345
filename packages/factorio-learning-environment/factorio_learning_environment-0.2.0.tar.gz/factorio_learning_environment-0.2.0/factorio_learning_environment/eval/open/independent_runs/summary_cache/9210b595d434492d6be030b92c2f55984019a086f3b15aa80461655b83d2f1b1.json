{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (5.5, 21.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (5.5, 21.5)\n- Boiler at position (-1.5, 24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting offshore pump to boiler and boiler to steam engine\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (10.0, 0.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (13.0, 0.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (16.0, 0.0)\n- Burner Inserters positioned at (8.5, 0.5), (17.5, 0.5), (19.5, 0.5), and (20.5, 0.5) for moving items between furnaces and chests\n- Wooden Chests at positions (17.5, -0.5), (19.5, -0.5), and (20.5, -0.5) for inserter output\n\n### Research Lab\n- Lab with no research in progress, positioned with electrical connections\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Undefined Class Names\n- Ensure that class names such as `Furnace` and `StoneFurnace` are correctly defined and imported. Use fully qualified names like `entities.Furnace` to avoid `NameError`.\n\n### Attribute Errors with List Objects\n- Avoid using list objects where class attributes are expected. Ensure the correct type is being checked or manipulated.\n\n### Connection Issues with Pipes\n- When connecting entities such as offshore pumps and boilers, ensure that the correct pipe types are used and that all necessary connections are made. Verify the positions and ensure there are no obstructions.\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities Too Far\n- Move closer to the target position before attempting to place an entity. Ensure the player is within the maximum allowable distance for placement.\n\n### Failed Research Initiation\n- Check if the necessary research packs are available and ensure the lab is correctly set up with power and input materials before initiating research.\n\n### Steam Engine Not Working\n- Verify connections and fuel supply to the steam engine to ensure it is operational. Check for any missing or misaligned pipes or fuel shortages."}
