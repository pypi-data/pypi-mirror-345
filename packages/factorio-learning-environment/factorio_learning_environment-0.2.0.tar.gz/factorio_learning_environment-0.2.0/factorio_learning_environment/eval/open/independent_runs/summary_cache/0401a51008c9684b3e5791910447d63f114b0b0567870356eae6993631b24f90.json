{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Coal mining setup at position (30.0, 0.0)\nUpdated with functional production chain:\n- Burner mining drill at (30.0, 0.0) (active, producing 21 coal/minute)\n- Wooden chest at (30.5, 1.5) (contains 29 coal, directly receiving from drill)\n- Fuel system: 46 coal remaining in drill\n\n#### Stone brick production at position (-50.0, 0.0)\n(No changes from previous report)\n\n#### Coal distribution system at position (18.5, -0.5)\n(No changes from previous report)\n\n#### Stone brick production line at position (21.0, 13.0)\n(No changes from previous report)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Placement collision resolution (steps 88-92)\n- Critical fixes implemented:\n  - Cleared blocked output at (30.5,1.5)\n  - Verified empty space before placement\n  - Matched chest position to drill drop position\n- Key learning:\n  - Always clear target tiles completely before placement\n  - Use direct position matching for output collection\n  - Verify empty space visually before building\n\n#### Connection protocol mastery\n- Successful implementation:\n  - Direct drill-to-chest connection\n  - No belts/inserters needed for simple mining\n  - Proper fuel management system\n- Confirmed best practices:\n  - Simple mining setups don't require complex connections\n  - Direct output collection works for single-output machines\n  - Fuel monitoring prevents interruptions\n\n#### Spatial planning improvements\n- Current successful layout:\n  - 1-tile spacing between drill and chest\n  - Clear output path\n  - No overlapping entities\n- Maintain these standards:\n  - Keep this spacing template for new drills\n  - Document successful layouts as templates\n  - Apply to future furnace connections\n\n#### Production monitoring\n- Implemented systems:\n  - Fuel level tracking\n  - Output rate calculation\n  - Chest capacity monitoring\n- Expand to:\n  - Automated low-fuel alerts\n  - Full-chest detection\n  - Production logging\n\n#### Optimization path\n- Current achievements:\n  - 131% of target production\n  - Stable 21 coal/minute\n  - Fuel for 47 minutes\n- Next steps:\n  1. Replicate successful design\n  2. Implement fuel auto-replenishment\n  3. Expand monitoring to all production lines"}
