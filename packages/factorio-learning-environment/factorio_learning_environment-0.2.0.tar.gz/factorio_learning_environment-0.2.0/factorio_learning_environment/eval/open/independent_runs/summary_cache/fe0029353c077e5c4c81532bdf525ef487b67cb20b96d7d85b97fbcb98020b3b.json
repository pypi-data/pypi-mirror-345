Resource Crafting Attempts\n- Don't attempt to craft raw resources (wood, stone) - these must be harvested from the map\n- Always check if an item needs to be crafted or gathered before attempting crafting\n\n2. Entity Placement Issues\n- When placing entities that need to interact (like inserters between chests and furnaces), ensure proper spacing\n- Consider the entity dimensions and required clearance when placing structures\n- If placement fails, try adjusting the position or increasing spacing between entities\n\n3. Inventory Management\n- Verify inventory contents before attempting to insert items\n- Keep track of fuel requirements for burner entities\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nFunctions:\n- place_entity_next_to(): Places an entity adjacent to a reference position\n  Success: When there's sufficient space and no collisions\n  Failure: When there are blocking entities or invalid placement positions\n\n- insert_item(): Inserts items into an entity\n  Success: When inventory has required items\n  Failure: When items are missing from inventory\n\nImportant Variables:\n- EntityStatus: Enum tracking entity states (WORKING, NO_FUEL, NO_INGREDIENTS, WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS)\n- Direction: Enum for entity orientation (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT)\n- Position: Type for coordinate positions (x, y)"}
