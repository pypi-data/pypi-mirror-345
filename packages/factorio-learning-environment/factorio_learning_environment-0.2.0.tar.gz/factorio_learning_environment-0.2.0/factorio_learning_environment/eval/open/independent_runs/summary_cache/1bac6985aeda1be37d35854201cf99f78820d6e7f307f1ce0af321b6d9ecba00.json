{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Smelting Facility at Position (1.0, 1.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (1.0, 1.0)\n  - Status: No Ingredients\n  - Furnace Inventory: Contains 10 units of coal\n  - Fuel: Contains 10 units of coal\n\n### Iron Smelting Facility at Position (3.0, 1.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (3.0, 1.0)\n  - Status: No Ingredients\n  - Furnace Inventory: Contains 10 units of coal\n  - Fuel: Contains 10 units of coal\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to place an entity. For example, attempting to place a stone furnace without having it in the inventory will result in an error.\n- Verify that the target location is suitable for placing an entity. Avoid attempting to place entities where there are existing objects in the way.\n\n### Errors related to crafting and inventory management\n- Ensure you have sufficient resources in your inventory before crafting. For instance, attempting to craft a Stone Furnace without enough stone will cause an error.\n- Keep track of your inventory levels to avoid assertion errors related to insufficient resources, such as iron ore.\n- Ensure you have all necessary ingredients before attempting to craft complex items. For example, crafting a Burner Mining Drill requires iron plates, iron gear wheels, and a stone furnace.\n- Before crafting an Inserter, ensure you have iron plates, iron gear wheels, and electronic circuits available in your inventory.\n- Avoid referencing undefined variables in your code. For instance, ensure that 'crafted_inserters' is defined before using it in a condition.\n\n### Errors when extracting items from entities\n- Confirm that the entity contains the items you wish to extract. Attempting to extract iron plates from a stone furnace that does not contain them will result in an error.\n- Ensure that the stone furnace has completed the smelting process before attempting to extract iron plates. Repeated attempts to extract iron plates prematurely will result in errors.\n- Attempting to extract copper plates from a stone furnace without copper plates will result in an error. Ensure the furnace has processed copper ore into copper plates before extraction.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient fuel\n- Always ensure that the stone furnace is adequately fueled before initiating the smelting process. Lack of fuel will prevent the furnace from operating and producing the desired output.\n- Make sure to have coal in your inventory before attempting to insert it into the furnace. Attempting to insert coal without having it will result in an error.\n\n### Errors related to premature extraction attempts\n- Avoid attempting to extract items from the stone furnace before the smelting process is complete. Ensure the furnace has processed the iron ore into iron plates before extraction attempts.\n\n### Errors related to furnace operation\n- Ensure that the furnace has both fuel and ingredients to smelt. The furnace at position (3.0, 1.0) is out of fuel and has no ingredients, preventing it from operating.\n\n### Repeated Errors in Copper Plate Extraction\n- Repeated attempts to extract copper plates from the furnace at position (1.0, 1.0) indicate that the smelting process has not been completed. Ensure that the furnace has both fuel and copper ore and that the smelting process is complete before attempting extraction.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient coal in inventory\n- Ensure you have enough coal in your inventory before attempting to insert it into a furnace. An error occurred when attempting to insert coal without having sufficient coal in the inventory."}
