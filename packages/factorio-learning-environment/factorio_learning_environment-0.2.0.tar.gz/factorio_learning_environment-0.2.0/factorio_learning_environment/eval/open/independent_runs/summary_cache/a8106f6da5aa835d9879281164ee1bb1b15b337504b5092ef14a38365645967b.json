{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Stone Furnace at position (1.0, 1.0)\nConsists solely of a stone furnace that processes both iron ore and copper ore. It converts copper ore into copper plates for crafting and continues to smelt iron ore into iron plates for pipe production and other needs.\n\n### Wooden Chest at position (2.5, 2.5)\nConsists solely of the wooden chest entity used for inventory storage and management, unchanged from previous reports.\n\n### Laboratory Complex with Associated Power and Connection Network\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab at position (10.5, 10.5) used for research and related inventory management.\n- SteamEngine at position (8.5, 10.5) that generates power.\n- SmallElectricPole at position (12.5, 10.5) and Extra SmallElectricPole at position (10.5, 8.5) to complete the electrical connection network for the laboratory.\n\n### Boiler and Pipe Connection System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Boiler at position (11.5, 14.0) supplying steam through its steam output at position (11.5, 12.0).\n- PipeGroup connecting the Boiler\u2019s steam output at (11.5, 12.0) to the SteamEngine connection point at (8.5, 13.0) using newly crafted pipes, ensuring power generation continuity.\n\n### Offshore Pump Water Supply System\nConsists solely of:\n- OffshorePump repositioned to x=-1.5, y=28.5. \nThis OffshorePump was crafted and repositioned to supply water to the Boiler, although attempts to connect it with pipes to the Boiler encountered blocked connection points.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 Insufficient Inventory for Entity Connections and Crafting\n  - When establishing pipe connections (e.g., between Boiler and SteamEngine), verify that sufficient inventory items (such as Pipes) are available before executing connection commands.\n  - Ensure that sub-ingredients for crafting entities like OffshorePump and their prerequisites (iron-plate and iron-gear-wheel) are adequately supplied, either through crafting or smelting, to avoid chain crafting failures.\n\n\u2022 Blocked Connection Points During Entity Linking\n  - Before connecting entities (e.g., pipes between OffshorePump and Boiler), ensure that connection points are unblocked and suitably positioned, preventing connection failures.\n  - Reassess entity placement if repeated blocked connection errors are encountered, adjusting positions to allow unimpeded connections.\n\n\u2022 API Parameter and Attribute Usage Errors\n  - Provide the correct type and number of arguments when calling functions (e.g., avoid supplying a position argument when picking up an entity if not required) to prevent value and attribute errors.\n  - In inventory extraction routines, use the proper entity type to avoid attribute errors such as attempting extraction on a string rather than an entity.\n\n\u2022 Persistent Power Supply Warnings\n  - Review electric and fluid connection statuses for the Boiler, SteamEngine, and Lab. Resolve warnings by ensuring all entities have correct power or fluid inputs, consistent with their connection configurations."}
