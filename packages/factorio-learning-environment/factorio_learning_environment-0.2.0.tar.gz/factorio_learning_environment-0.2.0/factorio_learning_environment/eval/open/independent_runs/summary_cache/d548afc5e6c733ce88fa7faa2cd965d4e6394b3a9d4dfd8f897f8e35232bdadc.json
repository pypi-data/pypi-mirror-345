{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Distribution System at Position (x=41.0, y=-82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0) extracting coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=40.5, y=-83.5) and another at (x=42.5, y=-83.5) for storing coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=41.5, y=-83.5) transferring coal from the mining drill to the chests.\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (x=42.5, y=-83.5) to (x=45.5, y=-83.5) for coal transportation.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) and another at (x=2.0, y=0.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Both furnaces are fueled by coal and are currently without ingredients to smelt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entity for the inserter has items available for transfer. This can be resolved by checking the inventory of the source entity and ensuring it is not empty.\n\n### Burner Mining Drill Out of Fuel\n- Regularly refuel the burner mining drill to prevent it from stopping operations. Monitor the fuel inventory and replenish it before it runs out.\n\n### Furnace No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Ensure that the stone furnaces have a steady supply of raw materials to process. Regularly check and replenish the furnace source inventory with the necessary ingredients."}
