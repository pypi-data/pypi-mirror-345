{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-4.5, 23.0)\nConsists of boiler (position -4.5, 23.0) and offshore pump (position not placed).\n\n### Copper plate factory\nConsists of following entities\n- Furnace (position 0.0, 0.0)\n- Furnace (position 5.0, 5.0)\n- Lab (position not placed)\n\n### Pipe network\nConsists of the following pipe groups:\n- PipeGroup (position -9.5, -6.5)\n- PipeGroup (position -4.5, 19.5)\n- PipeGroup (position -15.5, 23.5)\n- PipeGroup (position -18.5, 25.5)\n- PipeGroup (position -21.5, 28.5)\n- PipeGroup (position -20.5, 29.5)\n\n### Electric network\nConsists of the following entities\n- Small electric pole (position 1.5, -11.5)\n- Small electric pole (position -2.5, -9.5)\n- Small electric pole (position -2.5, -8.5)\n- Small electric pole (position 1.5, -9.5)\n- Small electric pole (position 1.5, -7.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to entity connections\n- Ensure that all entities are placed correctly and are within the valid range for connections. For example, the error regarding the offshore pump indicates that it was not placed correctly or is not present at the specified position.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing. \n\n### AttributeError regarding Position object\n- Verify that the Position object is being used correctly in your code. The error suggests that the 'Position' object does not have a 'position' attribute, which indicates a possible misuse of the object. \n\n### Errors related to missing entities\n- When attempting to access an entity, ensure that it exists at the specified position to avoid exceptions."}
