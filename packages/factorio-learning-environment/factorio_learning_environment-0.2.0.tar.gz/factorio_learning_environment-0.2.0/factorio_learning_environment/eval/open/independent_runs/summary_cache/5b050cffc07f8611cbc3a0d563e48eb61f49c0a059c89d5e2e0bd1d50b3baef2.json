{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (4.0, -60.0) with a drop position at (4.5, -58.5) connected to a series of wooden chests.\n- Wooden Chests at positions (5.5, -60.5), (4.5, -58.5), (7.5, -60.5), (6.5, -60.5), (9.5, -60.5), and (8.5, -60.5) for storage.\n- Stone Furnaces at positions (-15.0, -48.0), (-13.0, -48.0), and (-11.0, -48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden Chests at positions (-14.5, -50.5), (-13.5, -50.5), (-12.5, -50.5), (-11.5, -50.5), (-10.5, -50.5), (-9.5, -50.5), (-8.5, -50.5), (-7.5, -50.5), and (-6.5, -50.5) for storing iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Lack of Fuel\n- Ensure that all Burner Mining Drills are adequately fueled to maintain continuous operation. Regularly check and refuel as necessary to prevent stoppages.\n\n### Errors from Full Storage\n- Monitor storage chests to prevent them from becoming full. Consider expanding storage capacity or regularly transferring items to prevent production halts.\n\n### Errors from Lack of Ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces have a continuous supply of raw materials to avoid production stoppages. Regularly check and replenish the supply of iron ore to furnaces.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined in the provided steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `iron-ore`: Type - Inventory Item, used in furnaces for smelting.\n- `iron-plate`: Type - Inventory Item, produced from smelting iron ore.\n- `coal`: Type - Inventory Item, used as fuel in furnaces.\n- `wood`: Type - Inventory Item, part of the final inventory.\n- `iron-gear-wheel`: Type - Inventory Item, part of the final inventory."}
