{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Collection and Transfer System at Position (42.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (42.0, -83.0), which is currently out of fuel and has its output blocked.\n- Burner Inserter at position (42.5, -81.5), which is repositioned to align with the drill's drop position and is fueled with coal. It transfers coal to a Wooden Chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (43.5, -80.5) to collect coal from the inserter.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -49.0), which is currently full of output and fueled with coal. It processes iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities\n- Ensure that the intended position for placing an entity, such as a Wooden Chest or Burner Inserter, is not occupied by another object. Use clear areas for placement to avoid placement errors.\n\n### Errors with Entity Alignment\n- When aligning entities such as inserters and chests, ensure that the positions are correctly calculated and that there is a clear path for item transfer.\n\n### Errors with Data Types in Code\n- Ensure that when defining dimensions or other attributes in code, the correct data types are used. For instance, when using the `int()` function, ensure that the argument is a string, a bytes-like object, or a real number.\n\n### Errors with Output Blockage\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity in place to accept the output from drills or other production entities to prevent blockage and warnings."}
