{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (5.5, 21.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (5.5, 21.5)\n- Boiler at position (-1.5, 24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine\n- Small Electric Poles connecting the steam engine to other entities\n\n### Lab Facility at Position (2.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab at position (2.5, 0.5) which is currently conducting Automation research\n- Connected to the electricity network via small electric poles\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) used for smelting copper ore into copper plates\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Insufficient Resources for Crafting\n- Ensure you have enough resources before attempting to craft items. For example, copper plates and wood are needed to craft copper cables and small electric poles.\n\n### Connection Errors with Pipes and Electrical Poles\n- Verify that you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to connect entities like steam engines and labs with pipes or electric poles.\n\n### Entity Not Found Errors\n- Confirm the existence and correct positioning of entities like labs before attempting operations that involve them.\n\n### NameError in Code Execution\n- Double-check variable names in your code to avoid NameError exceptions. Ensure that all variables are defined before use.\n\n### Assertion Errors in System Status\n- Regularly check the status of your entities, like the steam engine, to ensure they are functioning as expected. Address any issues that prevent them from working.\n\n### Inventory Management for Refueling\n- Maintain a sufficient amount of coal in your inventory to ensure continuous operation of boilers and other fuel-dependent entities."}
