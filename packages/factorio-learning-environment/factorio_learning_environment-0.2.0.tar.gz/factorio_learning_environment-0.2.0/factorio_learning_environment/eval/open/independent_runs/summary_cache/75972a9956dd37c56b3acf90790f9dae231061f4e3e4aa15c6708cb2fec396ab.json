This structure supports the conversion of raw iron ore into a refined resource needed for downstream production.\n\n### Copper Smelting Furnace at Position(x=-27.0, y=-60.0)\nConsists of a single furnace located at (\u201327.0, \u201360.0) that is used to convert copper ore, along with coal, into copper plates. This refined copper product is essential for manufacturing items such as copper cables.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 API Parameter Usage for Entity Retrieval\n  - When invoking get_entities, ensure that only the supported parameters are used. In one instance, using a keyword argument ('radius') generated an error, while later passing positional arguments also produced a TypeError. Verify and adhere to the function\u2019s expected signature.\n\n\u2022 Handling Retrieved Data\n  - Always check that the result from a function like get_entities is not None before attempting to iterate over it. Use an empty list as a fallback to avoid errors such as \u201cNoneType object is not iterable.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Lab Placement and Inventory Validation\n  - Before attempting to place a Lab, confirm that the Lab entity is present in the inventory. Errors indicating \u201cNo lab in inventory\u201d highlight the need to validate resource availability prior to placement actions.\n\n\u2022 Lab Crafting and Resource Dependencies\n  - Several lab crafting attempts failed due to missing sub-ingredients (for example, iron-gear-wheels, electronic circuits, and copper cables). Ensure that all prerequisite resources and their production steps (such as smelting iron and copper plates) are sufficiently fulfilled to support lab crafting."}
