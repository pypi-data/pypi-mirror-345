{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at Position (x=4.0, y=-60.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=4.0, y=-60.0) with a warning indicating that the chest at the drop position is full. It is currently working and connected to:\n  - **Wooden Chest** at position (x=4.5, y=-58.5), containing 14 units of iron ore.\n- Additional **Wooden Chests** at positions (x=5.5, y=-60.5), (x=7.5, y=-60.5), (x=6.5, y=-60.5), (x=9.5, y=-60.5), and (x=8.5, y=-60.5), all with empty inventories.\n\n### Iron Smelting Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-15.0, y=-48.0), working with a fuel inventory of 22 units of coal, containing 4 units of iron ore and producing 22 iron plates.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-13.0, y=-48.0), with a warning of \"no ingredients to smelt,\" containing 24 iron plates.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-11.0, y=-48.0), with warnings of \"no ingredients to smelt\" and \"furnace fuel source is full,\" with no current production.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Insufficient Fuel for Mining Drills\n- Ensure that there is a sufficient supply of coal in the inventory to refuel burner mining drills. Regularly check and replenish coal supplies to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Full Chest at Drop Position\n- Regularly empty the chest at the drop position of the burner mining drill to prevent mining operations from halting due to a full inventory.\n\n### No Ingredients to Smelt in Furnaces\n- Ensure that furnaces have a continuous supply of raw materials to smelt. Regularly check and supply the necessary ingredients to avoid idle furnaces.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined by the agent in the provided logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `wooden-chest`: int, count of wooden chests in the inventory (3).\n- `coal`: int, count of coal units in the inventory (5).\n- `iron-plate`: int, count of iron plates in the inventory (6384).\n- `iron-gear-wheel`: int, count of iron gear wheels in the inventory (4)."}
