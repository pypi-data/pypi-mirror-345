For example, iron plates are required for crafting pipe-to-ground.\n\n### Errors in Entity Connections\n- Make sure all entities, such as steam engines and boilers, are properly connected to function correctly.\n\n### Errors in API Usage\n- Double-check the attribute names when using the API to avoid errors such as 'Prototype' has no attribute 'PipeToGround'. Use the correct attribute names like PipeGroup."}
