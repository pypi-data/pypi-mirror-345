# bag

A bug is a [collection](/data_md/computer_science/definitions/data_structure/collection.md) that allows for the storage of multiple items, where the same item can be stored multiple times. It is similar to a [multiset](/data_md/mathematics/definitions/foundamental/multiset.md), but does not require any specific ordering of the items. Removing items is not supported. A bug allows to iterate through the collected items.
