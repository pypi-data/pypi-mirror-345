If you receive an error about distance, move closer to the target location before attempting to place the item again.\n\n3. **Resource Verification**: Before crafting, verify that you have enough resources to complete the task. This can prevent unnecessary crafting attempts and errors.\n\n4. **Sequential Actions**: Break down tasks into smaller steps and confirm each step's success before proceeding to the next. This can help identify where issues may arise.\n\n5. **Error Handling**: Be prepared to handle errors gracefully. If an action fails, assess the situation and make adjustments before trying again.\n\nBy following these tips and maintaining a systematic approach, players can enhance their efficiency and success in interacting with the Factorio AI and managing their in-game resources.", "summary_range": "[1-1648]"}
