{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron ore mining and smelting structure at position around (17.5, 72.5)\nConsists of the following connected entities:\n- Electric mining drill at position (17.5, 72.5) facing down, currently powered but output blocked due to furnace belt blockage.\n- Stone furnace at position (18.0, 75.0) fueled with coal and operational, smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Three wooden chests at positions (19.5, 75.5), (21.5, 75.5), and (21.5, 77.5) serving as storage for iron plates.\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5) and (20.5, 77.5) fueled with coal and operational, moving iron plates between furnace and chests.\n- Small electric poles at (15.5, 75.5), (17.5, 72.5), (22.5, 75.5), and (12.5, 72.5) connected to the power network.\n- Output belt blockage at furnace output remains unresolved, causing mining drill output blockage.\n\nThis structure enables extraction, smelting, and staged storage of iron plates with improved power connectivity and inserter fueling, but output belt blockage persists.\n\n### Steam power generation structure at position around (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, -0.5) extracting water.\n- Boiler at position (-5.0, 2.5), currently out of fuel and not working.\n- Steam engine at position (0.5, 6.5) connected to boiler by pipes, currently working and generating power.\n- Small electric poles near boiler (-4.5, -0.5), steam engine (0.5, 3.5), and newly placed pole at (0.5, 6.5) connected to power network.\n\nThis structure reliably generates electricity from steam power when fueled; currently boiler fuel needs replenishment.\n\n### Iron gear wheel assembly structure at position around (25.5, 80.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine 2 at (25.5, 80.5), powered and connected to input and output wooden chests at (21.5, 75.5) and (25.5, 82.5) respectively.\n- Burner inserter at (25.5, 83.5) fueled with coal and operational, moving assembled items into output chest.\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 77.5) and (25.5, 83.5) fueled and operational.\n- Iron plates are now being inserted directly into the assembling machine input, enabling partial crafting of iron gear wheels.\n- Assembling machine reports occasional shortage of iron plates preventing continuous crafting.\n\nThis structure is intended for iron gear wheel production, now receiving iron plates input and producing gear wheels, though input supply fluctuations cause intermittent shortages.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity placement conflicts due to occupied tiles\n- Repeated failure to place small electric poles near steam engine at (0.5, 6.5) and near furnace at (18.0, 75.0) due to existing entities blocking placement.\n- Attempts to place poles with spacing 2 and direction UP failed due to collisions with mining drills or furnaces.\n- To avoid these errors, verify tile occupancy before placement, increase spacing, change placement direction, or select alternative reference positions.\n\n### Inserter inventory and fuel management\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5), (20.5, 77.5), and (25.5, 83.5) are consistently fueled and operational.\n- Some inserters show \"waiting for source items\" status due to empty source chests.\n- Maintain sufficient fuel supply and ensure source inventories contain items to prevent inserter idling.\n\n### Crafting and recipe dependency errors\n- Assembling machine at (25.5, 80.5) previously lacked iron plates input, preventing crafting.\n- Recent steps show iron plates being inserted directly into assembler input, resulting in partial production of iron gear wheels.\n- However, assembler occasionally reports shortage of iron plates (e.g., missing 2 iron plates).\n- Ensure continuous and adequate supply of iron plates to the assembler input to maintain uninterrupted crafting.\n\n### Output blockage and power connectivity warnings\n- Mining drill at (17.5, 72.5) continues to report \"furnace belt at drop position is blocked,\" causing output blockage.\n- Furnace output inventory frequently full, preventing further smelting output.\n- Power network connectivity improved with additional poles placed near furnace and mining drill.\n- To resolve output blockage, clear or extend output belts and chests to accept items and prevent furnace output saturation.\n- Boiler at (-5.0, 2.5) is out of fuel, causing steam power"}
