{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-0.5, -9.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position -0.5, -9.5), boiler (position not specified), and offshore pump (position -9.5, 24.5).\n\n### Offshore pump at position(-9.5, 24.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump (position -9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe (position -9.5, 23.5) connected to the offshore pump\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(0, 0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (position not specified) and a furnace (position 0, 0)\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine (position not specified) and inserter (position not specified) that puts into assembling machine\n- Beltgroup (position not specified) that connects the furnace at position 0, 0 to assembling machine (position not specified)\n\n### Laboratory at position(5, 5)\nConsists of:\n- Lab (position 5, 5)\n\n### Stone furnace at position(5, 5)\nConsists of:\n- Furnace (position 5, 5)\n\n### Stone furnace at position(0, 0)\nConsists of:\n- Furnace (position 0, 0)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied positions\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it. For example, a pipe cannot be placed at position (-9.5, 23.5) because another entity already exists there.\n\n### Errors when connecting entities\n- Verify that the entities you are trying to connect are within the correct range and that there are no other obstructions preventing the connection. For instance, failed connections were reported when trying to connect pipes from the offshore pump to the steam engine.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors related to power and fluid connections\n- Ensure that all necessary connections for power and fluids are established to avoid warnings such as \"not connected to power network\" and \"no input liquid.\""}
