{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=20.5, y=-4.0)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=22.5, y=-7.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=20.5, y=-4.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=4.5, y=-10.5)\n- Pipe network connecting these entities, including positions (x=20.5, y=-10.5), (x=21.5, y=-10.5), (x=22.5, y=-10.5), (x=20.5, y=-8.5), (x=20.5, y=-9.5), (x=20.5, y=-6.5), (x=20.5, y=-7.5), (x=20.5, y=-5.5)\n- Small Electric Poles at positions (x=24.5, y=-6.5), (x=24.5, y=-7.5), and (x=22.5, y=-4.5)\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=2.0, y=0.0) with warnings of \"no ingredients to smelt\" and \"furnace result is full\"\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with a warning of \"no ingredients to smelt\"\n\n### Water Supply System\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=19.5, y=-1.5)\n- Pipe network connecting to the boiler, including positions (x=19.5, y=-2.5), (x=18.5, y=-2.5), (x=18.5, y=-3.5)\n\n### Storage and Inserter System\nConsists of:\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-3.5, y=0.5)\n- Inserter at position (x=-3.5, y=1.5) with a warning of \"inserter waiting for source items\"\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-3.5, y=2.5) containing iron plates\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of:\n- Small Electric Poles connecting various entities, including positions (x=4.5, y=-5.5), (x=22.5, y=-4.5), (x=-2.5, y=-3.5), (x=-3.5, y=3.5), (x=-1.5, y=3.5), (x=2.5, y=3.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Retrieving Entities\n- Ensure that the entity you are trying to retrieve exists at the specified position. For example, attempting to get a lab at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) resulted in an error because no lab was found there.\n\n### Errors when Using Inserters\n- Make sure that inserters have access to source items to avoid the \"waiting for source items\" warning.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Operations\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt to avoid warnings like \"no ingredients to smelt\" and \"furnace result is full\"."}
