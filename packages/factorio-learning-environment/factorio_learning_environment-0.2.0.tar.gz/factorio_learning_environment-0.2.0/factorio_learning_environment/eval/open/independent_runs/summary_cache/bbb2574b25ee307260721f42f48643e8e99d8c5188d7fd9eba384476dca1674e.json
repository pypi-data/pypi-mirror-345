{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) extracting iron ore, refueled with coal.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0) producing iron plates, fueled with coal, with a full output warning.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-10.0, y=-48.0) producing iron plates, fueled with coal.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) transferring items from the mining drill to the furnace, waiting for space in destination.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5) transferring items from a chest to another chest, waiting for source items.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-8.5, y=-47.5) transferring items from a chest to a furnace, waiting for source items.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (x=-14.5, y=-48.5), (x=-15.5, y=-48.5), (x=-14.5, y=-46.5), (x=-7.5, y=-47.5), and (x=-6.5, y=-47.5) for storage of iron ore and iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Space in Destination\n- Ensure that the destination for the inserter is not full before attempting to transfer items. Regularly check and clear the destination inventory to prevent blockage.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Make sure that the source for the inserter has items available for transfer. Regularly supply the source with necessary items to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Furnace Output Full\n- Regularly remove items from the furnace output to prevent production halts. Consider using additional inserters to automate the removal process and transfer items to storage chests.\n\n### Refueling Errors\n- Ensure that all fuel-dependent entities such as furnaces and mining drills are regularly refueled to maintain continuous operation. Automate refueling processes where possible to prevent production downtime."}
