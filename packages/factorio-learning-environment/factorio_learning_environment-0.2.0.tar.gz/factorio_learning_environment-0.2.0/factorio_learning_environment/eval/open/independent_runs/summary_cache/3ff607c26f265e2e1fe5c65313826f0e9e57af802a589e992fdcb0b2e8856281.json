{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Wooden Chest at position(-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest (position -14.5, -48.5) with an inventory containing iron ore.\n\n### Furnace at position(-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace (position 0.0, 0.0) with no ingredients to smelt, currently holding iron plates.\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position(-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position -15.0, -50.0) currently working but has no coal available for refueling.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n- **Errors when extracting from the Wooden Chest without emptying it first**\n  - Ensure to empty the chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) before attempting to extract more iron ore, as it may lead to inefficient extraction.\n\n- **Errors when refueling the Burner Mining Drill without coal**\n  - Always check inventory for coal before attempting to refuel the Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0). If coal is low, consider harvesting from nearby coal resources.\n\n- **Errors when the chest at drop position is full**\n  - The Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) cannot continue mining because the chest at (-14.5, -48.5) is full. Regularly check and empty the chest to maintain mining operations.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- **Extract from Chest**: Invoked multiple times but resulted in warnings about the chest being full.\n- **Refuel Mining Drill**: Invoked but failed due to lack of coal in inventory.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `iron_ore`: int\n- `coal`: int\n- `furnace_status`: str\n- `chest_inventory`: dict\n- `mining_drill_position`: tuple (float, float)"}
