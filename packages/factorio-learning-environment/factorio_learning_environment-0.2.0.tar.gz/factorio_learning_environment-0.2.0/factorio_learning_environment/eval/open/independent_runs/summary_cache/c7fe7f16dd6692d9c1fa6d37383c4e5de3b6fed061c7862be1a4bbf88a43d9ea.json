{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with a burner inserter at position (1.5, 0.5) feeding it, and a wooden chest at position (2.5, 0.5) for storing iron plates.\n- Burner inserter at position (3.5, 0.5) moving items from the wooden chest at position (2.5, 0.5) to a transport belt.\n- Transport belt group connecting the inserter at position (3.5, 0.5) to another inserter at position (6.5, 0.5), which feeds into a wooden chest at position (7.5, 0.5) storing iron plates.\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (10.0, 0.0) with a burner inserter at position (8.5, 0.5) feeding it from a wooden chest at position (7.5, 0.5) storing copper ore.\n- Burner inserter at position (11.5, 0.5) moving copper plates from the furnace at position (10.0, 0.0) to a wooden chest at position (12.5, 0.5).\n\n### Coal Mining and Collection Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) mining coal, connected to a burner inserter at position (39.5, -82.5) which fuels the drill.\n- Wooden chest at position (40.5, -83.5) collecting mined coal.\n- Transport belt connecting the drill to the chest.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities without required inventory\n- Ensure you have the required entity in your inventory before attempting to place it. For example, attempting to place a wooden chest without having one in inventory resulted in an error.\n\n### Errors when extracting from non-existent or empty entities\n- Verify the existence and content of the target entity before attempting to extract items. An error occurred when trying to extract copper ore from a non-existent or empty wooden chest.\n\n### Errors when crafting without required sub-ingredients\n- Ensure all necessary sub-ingredients are available for crafting. An error occurred while crafting a burner mining drill due to missing iron plates for crafting iron gear wheels.\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied tiles\n- Check that the target tile is unoccupied before placing an entity. Multiple attempts to place a burner inserter failed due to existing objects blocking the placement.\n\n### Errors when using incorrect API arguments\n- Ensure the correct arguments are used when calling functions. An error occurred when trying to pick up an entity with incorrect arguments, resulting in a ValueError."}
