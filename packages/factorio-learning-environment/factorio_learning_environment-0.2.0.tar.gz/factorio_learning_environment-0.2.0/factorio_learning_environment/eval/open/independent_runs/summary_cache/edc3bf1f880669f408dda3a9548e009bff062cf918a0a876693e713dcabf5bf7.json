{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, y=-60.0) which is actively working, fueled by coal, and extracts iron ore. It drops the mined ore into a **Wooden Chest** at position (4.5, y=-58.5), which is currently full.\n- **Furnaces** at positions (-15.0, y=-48.0), (-13.0, y=-48.0), and (-11.0, y=-48.0) which are used for smelting iron ore into iron plates. These furnaces are fueled by coal but currently have no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Storage Area\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Multiple **Wooden Chests** at positions (5.5, y=-60.5), (7.5, y=-60.5), (6.5, y=-60.5), (9.5, y=-60.5), (8.5, y=-60.5), (-14.5, y=-50.5), (-13.5, y=-50.5), (-12.5, y=-50.5), (-11.5, y=-50.5), (-10.5, y=-50.5), (-9.5, y=-50.5), (-8.5, y=-50.5), (-7.5, y=-50.5), (-6.5, y=-50.5), and (-5.5, y=-50.5). These chests are used for storing iron ore and iron plates. Some of these chests are full, indicating a need for better inventory management.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Full Chests\n- Ensure that chests used for collecting resources from mining drills are regularly emptied to prevent mining operations from halting. The chest at position (4.5, y=-58.5) is full, preventing further mining.\n\n### Errors due to No Ingredients in Furnaces\n- Regularly supply furnaces with the necessary ingredients to maintain continuous production. The furnaces at positions (-15.0, y=-48.0), (-13.0, y=-48.0), and (-11.0, y=-48.0) have no ingredients to smelt, which halts production.\n\nNAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions**: None defined.\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `wood`: int = 10\n  - `coal`: int = 220\n  - `iron_ore`: int = 353\n  - `iron_plate`: int = 6219\n  - `iron_gear_wheel`: int = 4\n\nNo utility functions have been defined or invoked, thus no success or failure modes are reported."}
