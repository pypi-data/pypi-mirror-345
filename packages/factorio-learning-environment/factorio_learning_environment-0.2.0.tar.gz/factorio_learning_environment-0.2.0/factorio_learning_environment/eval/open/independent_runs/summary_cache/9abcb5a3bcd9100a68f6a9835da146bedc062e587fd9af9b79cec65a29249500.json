{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation Facility (Updated)\n- **Boiler** at (-8.5, 0.0) - Operational with coal fuel but disconnected (status: NOT_CONNECTED)\n- **Pipe Network** (system 15581):\n  - Pipes at (-6.5, 0.5) and (0.5, 0.5)\n  - Status: EMPTY (no fluid present)\n\n### New Power Plant (Updated)\n- **Boiler** at (35.5, 47.0) - Fueled with coal but no water input\n- **Steam Engine** at (46.5, 40.5) - Connected to power pole but not receiving steam\n- **Pipe Network** (system 14475):\n  - Status: EMPTY (no fluid present)\n\n### Oil Processing Facility (Updated)\n- **Pumpjack** at (17.5, 40.5) - Now connected to power pole\n- **Oil Refinery** at (24.5, 44.5) - Connected to power pole\n- **Power Distribution**:\n  - Small electric poles network connecting all oil processing buildings\n\n### Coal Mining Operation (Updated)\n- **Electric Mining Drill** at (34.5, 20.5) - Now connected to power pole\n- **Transport Belt System** moving coal (status: WORKING)\n\n### Offshore Pump System (New)\n- **Offshore Pump** at (-11.5, -3.5) - Reinstalled but not connected\n- **Secondary Offshore Pump** at (-9.5, -2.5) - Not connected\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Persistent Placement Issues\n- Entity placement distance errors (steps 80,82) - Always verify player is within 10 tiles before placement\n- Entity collision errors (step 83) - Implement complete terrain checks (water/obstacles) before placement\n- Missing entity lookups (step 80) - Verify entity existence before interaction attempts\n\n### Fluid System Problems\n- Pipe connection failures (steps 81,84-87) - Validate all connection points are unobstructed\n- Long-distance pipe connections - Avoid connecting distant fluid systems (>20 tiles)\n- Offshore pump positioning - Verify water access and connection orientation\n\n### Power System Validation\n- Power pole placement - Clear target positions completely before placement\n- Entity power verification - Confirm power connections before asserting operational status\n- Steam engine validation - Ensure both power and fluid connections are established\n\n### Construction Best Practices\n1. Verify inventory before all placement operations\n2. Implement complete clearance checks for constructions\n3. Validate power connections immediately after placement\n4. Check fluid system integrity after modifications\n5. Confirm entity positions before interaction\n6. Maintain proximity (<10 tiles) during placement operations\n7. Verify terrain suitability before placement attempts\n8. Test connections incrementally during complex builds"}
