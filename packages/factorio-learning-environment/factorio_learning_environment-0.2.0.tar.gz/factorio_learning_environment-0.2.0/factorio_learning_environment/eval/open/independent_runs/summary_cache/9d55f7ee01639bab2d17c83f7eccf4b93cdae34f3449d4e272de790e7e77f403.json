{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nThis facility is responsible for mining iron ore and smelting it into iron plates. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) with a drop position at (-14.5, -48.5), extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-14.5, -48.5) and (-15.5, -48.5) for temporary storage of mined iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5) transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (-12.0, -48.0) and (-10.0, -48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserters** at positions (-14.5, -47.5) and (-11.5, -46.5) for transferring smelted iron plates to storage.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-14.5, -46.5) for storing iron ore and iron plates.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage Facility\nThis facility stores the produced iron plates. It consists of:\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-6.5, -49.5), (-6.5, -48.5), (-7.5, -48.5), (-5.5, -48.5), (-4.5, -48.5), and (-3.5, -48.5) for storing iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the inserter's pickup position is correctly aligned with the source entity. Check for any blockages or misalignments that may prevent the inserter from picking up items.\n\n### No Ingredients to Smelt in Furnace\n- Ensure that the furnaces are supplied with the necessary ingredients (iron ore) for smelting. Check the inserter and chest connections to ensure a continuous supply of raw materials to the furnaces.\n\n### Inserter Alignment and Rotation Issues\n- Regularly check and correct the alignment and rotation of inserters to ensure they are facing the correct direction and are able to pick up and drop items efficiently."}
