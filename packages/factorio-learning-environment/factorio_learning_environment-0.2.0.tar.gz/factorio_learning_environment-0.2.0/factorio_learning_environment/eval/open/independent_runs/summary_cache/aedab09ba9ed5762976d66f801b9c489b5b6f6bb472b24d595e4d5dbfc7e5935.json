Check the coordinates before attempting to place.\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities\n- Verify that the entity you are trying to access (e.g., steam engine) exists at the specified coordinates before attempting to retrieve it. Double-check the position and ensure it is correct.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
