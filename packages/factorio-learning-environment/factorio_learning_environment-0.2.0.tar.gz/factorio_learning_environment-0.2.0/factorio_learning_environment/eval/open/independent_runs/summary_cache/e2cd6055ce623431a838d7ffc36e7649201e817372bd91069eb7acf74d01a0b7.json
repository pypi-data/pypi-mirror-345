{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Setup at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): This entity is responsible for mining iron ore. It is currently fueled with coal and is operational. It drops mined iron ore into a chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): This chest stores the mined iron ore from the burner mining drill. It currently contains 23 units of iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): This inserter is supposed to transfer iron ore from the chest to the stone furnace. It is currently out of fuel and waiting for source items.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0): This furnace is intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates. It is fueled with coal but is not receiving iron ore due to a misalignment or setup issue.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Inserter Setup\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items from the chest to the furnace. Frequent repositioning indicates potential misalignment.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Fueling\n- Regularly check and refuel the inserter to ensure it operates continuously. An inserter out of fuel will not transfer items, causing a bottleneck in the production line.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Iron Ore\n- Verify the inserter setup to ensure that the iron ore is being transferred from the chest to the furnace. Adjust the inserter's position and alignment as necessary to facilitate the transfer.\n\n### Chest Overflow\n- Monitor the chest's capacity to prevent overflow, which can halt mining operations. Regularly extract items from the chest to maintain space for new resources.\n\n### General Maintenance Tips\n- Regularly check the fuel levels of all entities to ensure continuous operation.\n- Ensure that all entities are correctly positioned and aligned to maintain an efficient production line."}
