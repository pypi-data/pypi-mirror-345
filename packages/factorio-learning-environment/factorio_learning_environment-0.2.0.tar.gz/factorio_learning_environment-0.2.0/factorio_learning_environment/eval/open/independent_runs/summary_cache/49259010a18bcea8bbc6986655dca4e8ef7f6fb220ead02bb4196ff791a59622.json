{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Automation Science Pack Production Line (around x=8.5, y=13.5)\nConsists of following entities:\n- Assembling machine-1 at position(8.5, 13.5)\n- Iron gear inserter at position(8.5, 10.5)\n- Iron gear chest at position(7.5, 10.5)\n- Output inserter at position(10.5, 13.5)\n- Output chest at position(11.5, 13.5)\n- Transport belt system from position(8.5, 11.5) to (6.5, 11.5)\n\n### Power Generation System (around x=-4.5, y=12.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam engine at position(-4.5, 12.5)\n- Boiler at position(-4.5, 16.0)\n- Offshore pump at position(-3.5, 27.5)\n- Electric pole network connecting positions (1.5,6.5), (2.5,8.5), (-0.5,8.5), (-1.5,12.5), (0.5,14.5), (8.5,15.5)\n- Pipe network connecting water and steam systems\n\n### Mining and Smelting Operations\nMultiple mining and smelting setups at various locations:\n1. Setup at x=41, y=-82:\n   - Burner mining drill\n   - Chest at (41.5, -80.5)\n   - Burner inserter at (41.5, -79.5)\n\n2. Setup at x=-28, y=-61:\n   - Burner mining drill\n   - Chest at (-27.5, -59.5)\n   - Burner inserter at (-26.5, -59.5)\n   - Stone furnace at (-25.0, -59.0)\n   - Output inserter at (-23.5, -58.5)\n   - Output chest at (-22.5, -58.5)\n\n3. Setup at x=-18, y=-53:\n   - Burner mining drill\n   - Chest at (-17.5, -51.5)\n   - Burner inserter at (-16.5, -51.5)\n   - Stone furnace at (-15.0, -51.0)\n   - Output inserter at (-13.5, -50.5)\n   - Output chest at (-12.5, -50.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Collision Errors\n- Check for existing entities before placing new ones - multiple attempts to place chests and inserters where transport belts, electric poles, or other entities already exist\n- When placing entities next to each other, ensure proper spacing and direction to avoid collisions\n- Consider the full dimensions of larger entities (like assembling machines and furnaces) when placing adjacent entities\n\n### Resource Management Errors\n- Ensure required items are in inventory before attempting to insert them into containers\n- Keep burner entities fueled to maintain operation - multiple mining drills are out of fuel\n\n### Production Line Setup\n- Plan the layout of production lines carefully to ensure all components (inserters, chests, belts) can be placed without conflicts\n- Consider the space needed for input/output logistics when designing production setups\n\n### Power System Management\n- Monitor and maintain fuel levels in boilers to ensure consistent power generation\n- Ensure proper connection of power poles to maintain electricity network coverage"}
