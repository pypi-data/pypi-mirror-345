{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0), extracting iron ore and dropping it into:\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5), which stores iron ore.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-13.0, -48.0), which smelts iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-11.0, -48.0), which smelts iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-9.0, -48.0), which smelts iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-14.5, -46.5), waiting to transfer items from the chest to the furnaces.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (41.0, -82.0), extracting coal and dropping it into:\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (41.5, -80.5), which stores coal.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (43.0, -82.0), which smelts iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (43.5, -80.5), waiting to transfer items from the chest to the furnace.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Insufficient Inventory Items\n- Ensure that your inventory has the required items before attempting to insert them into entities. This will prevent errors like \"No iron-ore to insert from your inventory.\"\n\n### Errors when Inserters are Waiting for Source Items\n- Make sure that the source entities (such as chests or belts) have items available for inserters to pick up. This will prevent inserters from being idle with the status \"waiting for source items.\"\n\n### Errors due to Full Chests\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are full to ensure continuous operation of mining drills and other entities that depend on them. This will prevent warnings like \"chest at drop position is full. Empty the chest to continue mining.\""}
