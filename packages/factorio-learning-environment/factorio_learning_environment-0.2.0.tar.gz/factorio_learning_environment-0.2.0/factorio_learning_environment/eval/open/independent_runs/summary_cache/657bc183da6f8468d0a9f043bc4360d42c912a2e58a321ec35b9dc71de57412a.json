{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Distribution System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, y=-82.0) extracting coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (40.5, y=-83.5) for coal storage.\n- Burner Inserter at position (41.5, y=-83.5) transferring coal from the chest to another chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (42.5, y=-83.5) receiving coal from the inserter.\n- Burner Inserter at position (41.5, y=-80.5) transferring coal to another storage.\n- Wooden Chest at position (41.5, y=-79.5) for additional coal storage.\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (42.5, y=-83.5) to (45.5, y=-83.5) for coal transportation.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, y=0.0) processing iron ore into iron plates.\n- Stone Furnace at position (2.0, y=0.0) processing iron ore into iron plates, currently with full output.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entity has items available for the inserter to pick up. Check the inventory of the source entity and ensure it is not empty.\n\n### Furnace Output Full\n- Regularly check the output inventory of furnaces to ensure they are not full. If a furnace's output is full, it will stop processing, so make sure to transfer the output items to free up space."}
