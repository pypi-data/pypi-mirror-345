{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo new structures have been successfully created on the map. Although the agent repeatedly attempted to place a Lab at (0.5, 2.5), all such attempts failed due to inventory and resource shortages. Pre\u2010existing furnace entities (an iron smelting furnace at Position(x=5.0, y=5.0) and a copper furnace at Position(x=-27.0, y=-60.0)) were identified and used for smelting operations, but none of these were built or modified by the agent during these steps.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 Errors in using get_entities:\n\u2003\u2013 Avoid passing unsupported keyword arguments (such as \u201cradius\u201d) or extra positional parameters.\n\u2003\u2013 Adhere strictly to the function\u2019s expected signature to prevent TypeErrors.\n\u2022 Lab placement and crafting issues:\n\u2003\u2013 Ensure that the required Lab item is present in the inventory before attempting placement.\n\u2003\u2013 Verify that returned collections from entity retrieval are not None before iterating.\n\u2003\u2013 Confirm that all sub-ingredients for Lab crafting (for example, iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, copper-cables, and copper-plates) are available and producible via the correct crafting or smelting methods.\n\u2022 Resource management:\n\u2003\u2013 Regularly check resource counts and production outputs to meet the dependencies for complex items.\n\u2003\u2013 Review the complete ingredient chain for Lab production to preempt failures due to missing prerequisites."}
