In addition, at Step 245 a target inserter was added at (x=21.5, y=10.5) with its drop aligned to (x=20.5, y=10.5) to mediate the belt connection.\n\u2022 Belt Route Attempts \u2013 initial waypoints were set to (x=0.0, y=26.0) and (x=0.0, y=10.0); later revised attempts introduced an alternate waypoint (x=-4.0, y=10.0).\n\u2022 Note \u2013 Multiple belt connection attempts have failed due to issues including incorrect target entity type selection (direct targeting of a Prototype.SteamEngine), grid alignment errors in the path, and insufficient transport belt inventory.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 Placement and Inventory Verification:\n  - Ensure that the required item exists in the inventory before attempting placement.\n  - Confirm that the intended placement area is free of obstructions; if an object exists in the target area, remove or relocate it prior to placement.\n\n\u2022 Belt Connection Targeting:\n  - Do not connect transport belts directly to powered entities such as Prototype.SteamEngine. Always interpose an inserter as the target to mediate item transfer.\n  - Verify that the target entity variable (e.g. target_chest) is properly defined before use.\n\n\u2022 Belt Path and Alignment:\n  - Confirm that all intermediate waypoints are grid aligned and form a monotonic axis\u2010aligned path. Misaligned or fractional coordinates will trigger normalization errors.\n  \n\u2022 Transport Belt Inventory Checks:\n  - Before connecting belt segments, ensure that the available inventory count of transport belts meets the required number.\n  - If crafting fails due to missing sub-ingredients (for example, iron-plate required for transport-belt production), establish or verify that the necessary production facilities (smelter, crafting machine) are operational.\n\n\u2022 Consistent Connection Strategy:\n  - Use intermediary waypoints that avoid interference from other infrastructure (such as electrical poles or existing machines) especially during belt routing.\n  - Maintain uniform entity types at both the source and target ends to avoid connection type conflicts.\n\n\u2022 General API Usage:\n  - Double-check API calls for proper parameter use and ensure that required existence checks (both inventory and map entities) are performed before operation."}
