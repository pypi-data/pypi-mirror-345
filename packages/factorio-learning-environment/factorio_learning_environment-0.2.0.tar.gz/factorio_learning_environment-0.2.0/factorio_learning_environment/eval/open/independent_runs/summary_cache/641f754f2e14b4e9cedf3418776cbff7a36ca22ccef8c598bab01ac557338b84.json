Avoid mixing different ores in the same furnace to prevent insertion errors.\n\n### Errors due to lack of power\n- Connect all electrical entities to a functioning power network to ensure they receive electricity. Check connections and ensure that the power source is operational.\n\n### Errors due to lack of fuel\n- Regularly check fuel levels in all fuel-dependent entities like boilers and mining drills. Refill them as necessary to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Errors due to full storage\n- Regularly empty storage entities such as chests to prevent mining drills from halting due to full output slots."}
