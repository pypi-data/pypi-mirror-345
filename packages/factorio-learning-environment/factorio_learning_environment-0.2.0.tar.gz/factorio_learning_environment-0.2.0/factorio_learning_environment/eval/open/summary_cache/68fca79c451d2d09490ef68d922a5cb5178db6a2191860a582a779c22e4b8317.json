{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron gear wheel production line at position around (16.0, 71.0) to (21.5, 73.5)  \nConsists of the following connected entities forming a production chain for iron gear wheels:  \n- Burner mining drill at position (16.0, 71.0) extracting iron ore, currently fueled with coal  \n- Stone furnace at position (17.0, 73.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates, fueled with coal and actively working  \n- Burner inserters at positions (17.5, 71.5), (19.5, 73.5), and (23.5, 73.5), intended to move items between mining drill, furnace, assembling machine, and chest; all currently out of fuel and unable to operate  \n- Wooden chest at position (18.5, 73.5) collecting iron gear wheels  \n- Assembling machine 2 at position (21.5, 73.5) set to craft iron gear wheels from iron plates, but not receiving power and thus inactive  \n- Small electric poles at positions (18.5, 72.5), (18.5, 75.5), and (21.5, 75.5) intended to provide electricity connections; power network is established but assembler remains unpowered  \n\nThis structure integrates mining, smelting, assembling, and storage within a compact area, connected by inserters and powered by electric poles. However, burner inserters lack fuel and the assembling machine is not receiving electricity, causing production to halt.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to assembler not receiving power despite pole connections  \n- Verify that electric poles are correctly connected in a continuous power network covering the assembling machine and all inserters.  \n- Confirm that poles have power and that the assembling machine\u2019s connection points are within pole coverage.  \n- Check for any missing or incorrectly placed poles that might break the power network.  \n- Ensure the assembling machine is not placed on a tile that blocks power connection or is isolated from poles.\n\n### Errors inserting coal into burner inserters  \n- Burner inserters require fuel (coal) to operate; repeatedly failing to insert coal indicates either inventory depletion or incorrect insertion logic.  \n- Confirm that sufficient coal is available in the player\u2019s inventory before attempting insertion.  \n- Avoid attempting to insert coal into burner inserters when inventory is empty to prevent repeated errors.  \n- Implement checks to verify inventory contents before fuel insertion attempts.\n\n### Errors due to inserters being out of fuel and unable to operate  \n- Inserters without fuel cannot move items, causing blockages in production lines.  \n- Ensure burner inserters are regularly fueled with coal to maintain operation.  \n- Consider automating fuel supply to burner inserters or replacing them with electric inserters if power is available.\n\n### Errors related to output blockage and no sink entity for items  \n- Burner mining drill reports output blocked by items on the ground due to no connected entity to accept output.  \n- Ensure inserters are properly placed and fueled to pick up items from mining drills and transfer them downstream.  \n- Verify that inserters have space in their destination inventories (furnaces, chests) to avoid blockage.\n\n### General tips to mitigate placement, power, and fuel errors  \n- Before inserting items or fuel, always check inventory quantities to avoid failed insertions.  \n- Regularly verify power network connectivity and energy levels of electric entities to prevent production halts.  \n- Maintain fuel supply chains for burner entities to keep inserters and drills operational.  \n- When placing entities, confirm target tiles are free and not occupied by other entities to avoid placement failures.\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nNo user-defined functions have been defined in the current steps."}
