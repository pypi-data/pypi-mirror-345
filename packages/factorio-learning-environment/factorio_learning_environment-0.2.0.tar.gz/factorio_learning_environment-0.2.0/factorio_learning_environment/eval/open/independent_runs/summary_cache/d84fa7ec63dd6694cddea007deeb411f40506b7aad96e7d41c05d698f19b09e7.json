{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Infrastructure (Incomplete)\n- **Offshore Pump** at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\n- **Boiler** at position (x=-5.5, y=25.0)\n- **Steam Engine** at position (x=-12.5, y=24.5)\n- **Pipe Groups**:\n  - PipeGroup at position (x=-12.5, y=19.5) with multiple segments leading towards the boiler.\n  - PipeGroup at position (x=-8.5, y=23.5)\n  - PipeGroup at position (x=-7.5, y=25.5)\n- **Electricity Network**:\n  - Small electric poles connecting various entities, including inserters at positions (x=16.5, y=0.5) and (x=17.5, y=0.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\n- **Furnace** at position (x=15.0, y=0.0) with a status indicating no ingredients to smelt, but containing 60 iron plates.\n- **Inserters**:\n  - Inserter at position (x=17.5, y=0.5) connected to power but not receiving electricity.\n  - Inserter at position (x=16.5, y=0.5) connected to power but not receiving electricity.\n- **Chests**:\n  - Wooden chest at position (x=5.5, y=0.5)\n  - Wooden chest at position (x=18.5, y=0.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure that the pipe connections between the offshore pump and the boiler are correctly aligned and that there are no obstructions. Verify that the correct type of pipes (standard or underground) are being used for the intended connections.\n\n### Errors in Steam Engine Connection\n- Double-check the alignment and connectivity between the boiler and the steam engine. Ensure that the pipes are correctly placed and that there are no gaps or misalignments in the connection path.\n\n### Electricity Network Not Plugged In\n- Verify that all components requiring electricity are within the coverage area of the electric poles. Ensure that the poles themselves are connected to a power source and that there are no breaks in the electricity network.\n\n### Inserters Not Receiving Power\n- Ensure that inserters are placed within the coverage area of powered electric poles. Check the connectivity of the poles to the power source to resolve any issues of inserters not receiving electricity."}
