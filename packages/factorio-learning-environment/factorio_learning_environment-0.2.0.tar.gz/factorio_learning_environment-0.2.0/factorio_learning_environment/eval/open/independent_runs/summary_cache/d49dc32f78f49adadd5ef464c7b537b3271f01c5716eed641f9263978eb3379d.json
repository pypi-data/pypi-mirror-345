{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-7.0, 23.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (-3.5, 23.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-7.0, 23.5)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe Group connecting the offshore pump and boiler, with pipes at positions: (-8.5, 21.5), (-7.5, 21.5), (-8.5, 22.5), (-8.5, 23.5), (-9.5, 23.5)\n- Electricity Group with poles at multiple positions including (-6.5, 19.5), (-4.5, 25.5), (-9.5, -33.5), etc.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Furnace at Position (-16.0, -49.0) with a burner inserter at Position (-17.5, -48.5)\n- Furnace at Position (-14.0, -49.0) with a burner inserter at Position (-13.5, -47.5)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (-13.5, -46.5)\n- Iron Chest at Position (-11.5, -44.5)\n- Multiple burner inserters and transport belts connecting furnaces and chests, facilitating the movement of iron plates and coal.\n\n### Belt Groups\n- Belt Group 1: Inputs from (x=-11.5, y=-46.5) to (x=-9.5, y=-46.5), outputs from (x=-8.5, y=-45.5) to (x=-8.5, y=-43.5)\n- Belt Group 2: Inputs from (x=-12.5, y=-44.5) to (x=-12.5, y=-46.5), outputs from (x=-12.5, y=-45.5) to (x=-11.5, y=-46.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Inserting Items without Inventory\n- Ensure you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into machines or structures. For example, attempting to insert coal into a boiler without having coal in the inventory will result in an error.\n\n### Errors when Setting Research on Already Researched Technology\n- Verify the current research status before attempting to set a new research. Attempting to set research on a technology that is already researched will result in an error.\n\n### Errors when Setting Research without Prerequisites\n- Ensure all prerequisite technologies are researched before setting a new research. For instance, attempting to research \"Automation-2\" without having \"Electronics\" researched will cause an error."}
