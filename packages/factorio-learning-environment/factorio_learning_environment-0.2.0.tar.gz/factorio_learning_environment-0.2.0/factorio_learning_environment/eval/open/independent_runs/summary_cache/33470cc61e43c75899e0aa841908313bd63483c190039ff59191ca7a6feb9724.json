{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Structure\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) extracting iron ore, connected to:\n  - **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) storing iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) transferring iron ore from the wooden chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Coal Refueling System\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-1.5, y=0.5) intended to refuel the stone furnace with coal.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Alignment\n- Ensure that the inserter's pickup and drop positions are correctly aligned with the source and destination entities. Misalignment can prevent items from being transferred correctly.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Refueling\n- Regularly check and refuel inserters to ensure they have sufficient fuel to operate. An inserter without fuel will not function.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Operation\n- Verify that the furnace is receiving the necessary ingredients to smelt. If the furnace is not receiving iron ore, check the inserter setup and alignment.\n\n### Errors when Inserting Items\n- Ensure that the items you intend to insert are available in your inventory. Attempting to insert items not present in your inventory will result in an error.\n\n### Errors with Inventory Management\n- Keep track of your inventory levels to ensure you have enough resources for operations, such as refueling and crafting."}
