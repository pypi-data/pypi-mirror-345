{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) with coal as fuel. This drill is responsible for extracting iron ore and is connected to:\n  - **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) which stores extracted iron ore and iron plates.\n  - **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-15.5, y=-48.5) which is currently empty.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) with coal as fuel. This inserter moves items from the wooden chest to the stone furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0) with coal as fuel. This furnace is intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates but is currently not producing due to a lack of ingredients.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when extracting items from chests\n- Ensure that the target chest contains the specified item before attempting to extract. This will prevent errors related to missing items in the chest.\n\n### Errors when processing in furnaces\n- Verify that the furnace has the necessary ingredients to process. If the furnace is not producing, check the input inventory to ensure it contains the required materials for smelting.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity in a tile before attempting placement to avoid conflicts with existing entities."}
