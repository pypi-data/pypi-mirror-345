{"content": "I see the core issue now. Let me analyze what we've learned:\n\n1. Current Limitations:\n- We cannot craft wooden chests because wood is a raw resource that must be gathered\n- We cannot craft iron chests because we need a specific crafting/smelting machine\n- We only have 1 iron plate, which isn't enough for crafting anyway\n\n2. Available Resources:\n- 39 transport belts\n- 28 coal\n- 1 iron plate\n\n3. Alternative Approach Needed:\nInstead of trying to craft chests, we should:\n1. Use existing storage solutions\n2. Focus on fueling the mining drill with the coal we have\n3. Check what other entities already exist in the game world\n\nLet's try a simpler approach focusing on just fueling the drill:\n\n```python\n# Check our inventory\ninventory = inspect_inventory()\nprint(f\"Current inventory: {inventory}\")\n\n# Get the mining drill reference\ndrill = get_entities({Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill})[0]\nprint(f\"Found drill at: {drill.position}\")\nprint(f\"Current drill status: {drill.status}\")\n\n# Add coal to the drill if needed\nif drill.status == EntityStatus.NO_FUEL:\n    insert_item(Prototype.Coal, drill, quantity=5)\n    print(\"Added fuel to drill\")\n\n# Verify drill status\nprint(f\"Final drill status: {drill.status}\")\n```\n\nThis should at least get the drill running. Then we can look for alternative storage solutions or ways to gather the raw materials we need for chests.", "summary_range": "[1-2752]"}
