{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (52.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (52.0, -82.0) extracting coal and dropping into a chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (53.5, -80.5) storing coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (52.5, -79.5) transferring coal from the chest to another chest at position (52.5, -78.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -78.5) storing coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (52.5, -76.5) waiting for source items.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-12.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-12.0, -51.0) extracting iron ore and dropping into a chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-11.5, -49.5) storing iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-11.5, -48.5) waiting for source items.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) with no ingredients to smelt, containing iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-8.5, -48.5) waiting for source items.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -46.5) waiting for source items.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-13.5, -45.5) empty.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source items are available for the inserters to pick up. Check for blockages or missing items in the supply chain.\n- Verify that the inserters are correctly positioned to pick up items from the intended source.\n\n### Warnings of Full Chests\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are full to prevent mining drills from halting operations.\n- Implement a system to automatically transfer items from full chests to prevent production stoppages.\n\n### Furnace with No Ingredients\n- Ensure that the furnace has a consistent supply of ingredients to maintain production efficiency.\n- Check the supply chain to the furnace to ensure it is receiving the necessary materials for smelting.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- **Utility Functions:** None defined.\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `wooden-chest`: int = 3\n  - `wood`: int = 10\n  - `coal`: int = 1040\n  - `iron-ore`: int = 1856\n  - `iron-plate`: int = 1433"}
