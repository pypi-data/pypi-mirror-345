{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Line at (-2.0, -76.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (x=-2.0, y=-76.0) connected to\n- Stone furnace (x=-1.0, y=-74.0)\n- Burner inserter (x=0.5, y=-74.5)\n- Iron chest (x=1.5, y=-74.5) containing 155 iron plates\n\n### Copper Ore Processing Line at (-21.0, -73.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (x=-21.0, y=-73.0)\n- Iron chest (x=-21.5, y=-74.5) containing 299 copper ore\n- Burner inserter (x=-20.5, y=-74.5)\n- Stone furnace (x=-19.0, y=-74.0) containing 100 copper plates\n\n### Advanced Processing Complex (x=3.0 to x=7.5, y=-75.5 to y=-71.5)\nComplex system consisting of:\n- Two stone furnaces (x=3.0, y=-73.0 and x=5.0, y=-73.0)\n- Multiple iron chests:\n  - At (x=3.5, y=-75.5) containing 50 iron plates\n  - At (x=7.5, y=-72.5) containing 18 iron plates\n  - At (x=3.5, y=-71.5)\n- Multiple burner inserters:\n  - At (x=3.5, y=-74.5)\n  - At (x=5.5, y=-74.5)\n  - At (x=6.5, y=-72.5)\n- Connected by multiple belt groups:\n  - Belt group from (x=1.5, y=-74.5) to (x=1.5, y=-72.5)\n  - Belt group from (x=0.5, y=-71.5) to (x=8.5, y=-74.5)\n  - Belt group at (x=2.5, y=-71.5) with multiple directions\n  - Belt group from (x=0.5, y=-70.5) to (x=7.5, y=-69.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Belt Construction\n- Ensure you have the required items (transport belts) in inventory before attempting to connect entities with belts\n- Craft necessary components (iron gear wheels, transport belts) before attempting belt construction\n\n### Entity Status Issues\n- Multiple burner mining drills are out of fuel - ensure regular fuel supply to all mining equipment\n- Multiple furnaces show \"no ingredients to smelt\" warning - ensure proper input material flow\n- Several inserters are waiting for source items - verify the logistics chain is properly connected and supplied\n\n### Resource Management\n- Keep track of fuel levels in burner entities\n- Ensure proper material flow through the production chain\n- Monitor storage chest capacities to prevent backup (some furnaces show \"furnace result is full\" warning)"}
