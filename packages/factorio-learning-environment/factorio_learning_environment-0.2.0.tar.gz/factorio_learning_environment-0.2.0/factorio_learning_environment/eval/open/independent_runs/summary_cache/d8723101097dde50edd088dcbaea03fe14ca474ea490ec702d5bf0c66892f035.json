{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (x=41.0, y=-82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0) with a drop position at (x=40.5, y=-83.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=40.5, y=-83.5) containing 800 units of coal\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=41.5, y=-83.5) with a pickup position at (x=42.5, y=-83.5) and a drop position at (x=40.5, y=-83.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=42.5, y=-83.5) containing 625 units of coal\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (x=61.0, y=-54.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=61.0, y=-54.0) with a warning of \"no ingredients to smelt\"\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=61.5, y=-52.5) containing 5 units of coal\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=62.5, y=-53.5) containing 5 units of coal\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=62.5, y=-52.5) containing 5 units of coal\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=64.0, y=-53.0) with a warning of \"no ingredients to smelt\"\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Full Storage\n- Ensure that storage chests are emptied regularly to prevent mining operations from halting. The chest at position (x=40.5, y=-83.5) is full, causing mining operations to pause.\n\n### Errors Related to Missing Ingredients\n- Make sure that all necessary ingredients are available for production processes. The stone furnaces at positions (x=61.0, y=-54.0) and (x=64.0, y=-53.0) are not operational due to missing ingredients.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions**: None defined.\n- **Important Variables**: \n  - `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Represents the current inventory of the agent with items like 'stone-brick', 'wood', 'coal', 'stone', and 'iron-plate'.\n  - `entities_on_map`: List[Entity] - Represents the entities currently placed on the map, including their positions and statuses."}
