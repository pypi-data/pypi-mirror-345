{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, -60.0) with a drop position at (4.5, -58.5). It is currently working but has a warning: \"chest at drop position is full. Empty the chest at (4.5, -58.5) to continue mining.\"\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (4.5, -58.5), (5.5, -60.5), (6.5, -60.5), (7.5, -60.5), (8.5, -60.5), and (9.5, -60.5) containing various amounts of iron plates and iron ore.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (-15.0, -48.0), (-13.0, -48.0), and (-11.0, -48.0). The furnace at (-15.0, -48.0) has a warning: \"furnace result is full.\" The furnace at (-11.0, -48.0) has a warning: \"no ingredients to smelt.\"\n\n### Storage Area\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-5.5, -52.5), (-14.5, -50.5), (-13.5, -50.5), (-12.5, -50.5), (-11.5, -50.5), (-10.5, -50.5), (-9.5, -50.5), (-8.5, -50.5), (-7.5, -50.5), and (-6.5, -50.5) containing various amounts of iron ore and iron plates.\n- **Iron Chests** at positions (-6.5, -50.5) and (-5.5, -50.5), with the latter containing iron ore and iron plates.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Resource Availability Errors\n- Ensure that there is sufficient coal available to refuel burner mining drills to prevent interruptions in mining operations.\n- Maintain a steady supply of iron ore to furnaces to ensure continuous smelting. This can be achieved by regularly checking and refilling the iron ore supply.\n\n### Inventory Management\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are full to prevent mining and production stoppages. This includes both the chest at the drop position of the burner mining drill and the furnace result inventories.\n\n### Ingredient Supply for Furnaces\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. If a furnace shows a \"no ingredients to smelt\" warning, check the supply chain to ensure that iron ore is being delivered to the furnace.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- **Utility Functions Defined:**\n  - None specified in the logs.\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `final_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the final inventory state, including items like 'wooden-chest', 'coal', 'iron-ore', 'iron-plate', and 'iron-gear-wheel'.\n  - `entities_on_map`: List[Entity] - Represents the entities currently present on the map, though detailed data is omitted in the logs."}
