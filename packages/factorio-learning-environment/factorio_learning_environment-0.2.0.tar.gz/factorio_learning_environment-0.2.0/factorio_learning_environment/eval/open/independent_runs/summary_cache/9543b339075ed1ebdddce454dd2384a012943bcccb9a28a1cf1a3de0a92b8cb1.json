{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility at position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) with coal fuel, working status, and connected to a Stone Furnace.\n- Stone Furnace at position (41.0, -80.0) with coal fuel, working status, and currently processing iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (43.5, -79.5) with normal status, currently empty.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Facility at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) with coal fuel, working status, and connected to a Wooden Chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) with normal status, currently empty.\n\n### Inactive Furnace at position (-20.0, -71.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -71.0) with no fuel and no ingredients to smelt, currently inactive.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to insufficient inventory items\n- Ensure that you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities. For example, attempting to insert coal into a drill without having coal in the inventory will result in an error.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `insert_item(item: Prototype, target: Entity, quantity: int) -> Entity`: This function attempts to insert a specified quantity of an item into a target entity. It failed when there was no coal in the inventory to insert.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `iron_drill`: Represents the iron mining drill entity where coal is being inserted.\n- `copper_drill`: Represents the copper mining drill entity where coal is being inserted.\n- `iron_furnace`: Represents the furnace where iron ore and coal are being inserted for smelting."}
