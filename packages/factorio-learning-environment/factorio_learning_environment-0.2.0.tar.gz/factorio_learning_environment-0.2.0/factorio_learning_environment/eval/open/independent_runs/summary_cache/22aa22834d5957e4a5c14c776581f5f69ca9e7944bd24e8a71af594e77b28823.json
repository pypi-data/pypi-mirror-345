{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Stone Furnace Automation at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace positioned at (-15.0, -50.0) used for smelting operations; current state shows a furnace result inventory of {'iron-plate': 8}, a fuel reserve of {'coal': 16}, and a warning indicating no ingredients to smelt.\n- Wooden Chest positioned at (-13.5, -49.5) serving as storage; its inventory has been emptied following a manual extraction.\n- Burner Inserter positioned at (-14.5, -48.5) responsible for transferring items between the furnace and the chest; currently in a state of waiting for source items with a fuel reserve of {'coal': 4}.\n\nERROR TIPS\n### Stale Entity Data Retrieval Issues\n- Always confirm synchronization between entity data queries and the current map state to ensure up-to-date information. Avoid relying on outdated or placeholder data (e.g., <STALE_ENTITY_DATA_OMITTED/>) by verifying entities after any waiting period.\n\n### Inconsistent Extraction Operation Practices\n- When performing manual extraction, ensure proximity to the target entity and verify that the targeted inventory has the desired items before executing extraction procedures.\n\n### Errors with Incorrect Insertion Arguments and Inventory Checks\n- Always verify that the target entity is correctly passed as an argument when inserting items, and confirm sufficient inventory is available prior to insertion.\n\n### Insufficient Production Output Verification Failures\n- Allow adequate time for smelting processes to update outputs before performing inventory checks.\n\n### Resource Retrieval and Placement Timing Issues\n- Confirm target locations are accessible and correct before initiating resource transfers, and maintain process synchronization between extraction and insertion actions.\n\n### Cumulative Production Delay and Timeout Management\n- Adjust waiting periods strategically to account for potential delays in processing smelting outputs, thereby ensuring that production checks occur at appropriate intervals.\n\n### Fuel Insertion and Inventory Availability Errors\n- Prior to refueling operations (e.g., for burner inserters), verify that the respective inventory holds the required fuel items to avoid enactment failures."}
