{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-16.0, -51.0) with a drop position at (-16.5, -52.5), currently working and extracting iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-14.0, -49.0), currently working and producing iron plates. The furnace is fueled by coal and contains iron ore as the source material.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied or invalid locations\n- Ensure that the target tile is unoccupied and valid for placement before attempting to place entities such as Wooden Chests, Transport Belts, and Burner Inserters.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient inventory\n- Before attempting to place entities like Burner Mining Drills, verify that you have the required items in your inventory.\n\n### Furnace not producing iron plates\n- Regularly check the setup of the furnace to ensure it is correctly configured with the necessary fuel and input materials to produce iron plates.\n\n### Clearing items from the drill's drop position\n- Regularly clear items from the drill's drop position to prevent any blockage that might stop the drill from functioning effectively."}
