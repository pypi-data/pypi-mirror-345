Check for obstacles or restrictions that may prevent placement.\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied positions\n- Verify that the target position is not already occupied by another entity or marked as non-buildable before attempting to place an entity.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into non-existent or incorrect entities\n- Make sure that the entity you are trying to insert items into exists and is capable of accepting the specified items. Double-check the proximity and compatibility of entities before insertion.\n\n### Errors due to lack of resources or incorrect resource supply\n- Confirm that the necessary resources are available and correctly supplied to the intended entities.
