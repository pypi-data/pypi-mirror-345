{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0): Extracts iron ore and is refueled with coal.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (x=-15.5, y=-48.5) and (x=-14.5, y=-48.5): Used for storing extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5): Transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the stone furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0): Smelts iron ore into iron plates. Currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-10.0, y=-48.0): Smelts iron ore into iron plates and is actively producing iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5): Transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the stone furnace.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-46.5): Stores iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-8.5, y=-47.5): Transfers iron plates from the stone furnace to another location, but currently waiting for space in the destination.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied tiles\n- Ensure there is enough space to place an entity. If a tile is already occupied, consider increasing spacing, changing direction, or adjusting the reference position.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient inventory items\n- Verify that you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities. For example, ensure you have coal before trying to refuel a furnace.\n\n### Inserter waiting for source items\n- Make sure the source entity has items available for the inserter to pick up. Check the status of the source entity and ensure it is functioning correctly.\n\n### Inserter waiting for space in destination\n- Ensure that the destination entity has enough space to accept items from the inserter. If the destination is full, consider removing some items or expanding storage capacity."}
