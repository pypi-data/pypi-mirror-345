{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Setup at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nThis setup is designed to extract and process iron ore into iron plates. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at Position (-15.0, -50.0): Responsible for extracting iron ore from the resource patch. It is currently fueled with coal.\n- **Wooden Chest** at Position (-14.5, -48.5): Used to store extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at Position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the stone furnace. It is fueled with coal.\n- **Stone Furnace** at Position (-12.0, -48.0): Used to smelt iron ore into iron plates. It is currently fueled with coal but not receiving iron ore due to setup issues.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Alignment and Functionality\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items from the chest to the furnace. Misalignment can prevent the transfer of iron ore, as seen in multiple logs.\n\n### Errors with Resource Management\n- Regularly check and manage coal supplies to ensure that all entities requiring fuel (mining drills, inserters, and furnaces) are adequately refueled. Insufficient coal has been noted as a recurring issue.\n\n### Errors with Chest Management\n- Monitor the chest's inventory to prevent it from becoming full, which can halt the mining process. Ensure that iron ore is regularly extracted from the chest to maintain space for new resources.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Input\n- Verify that the furnace is receiving iron ore from the inserter. If the furnace is not smelting, check the inserter setup and ensure it is functioning correctly.\n\nBy addressing these errors, the efficiency of the iron ore processing setup can be improved, leading to a more streamlined production of iron plates."}
