{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Operation at (15.5,70.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill at (15.5,70.5) extracting iron ore\n- Wooden chest at (15.5,72.5) storing iron ore (currently contains 15 iron ore)\n\n### Copper Ore Mining Operation at (-46.5,70.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill at (-46.5,70.5) extracting copper ore\n- Wooden chest at (-46.5,72.5) storing copper ore (currently contains 16 copper ore)\n\n### Power Generation System at (-9.5,-0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5,-0.5) extracting water\n- Boiler at (-5.0,-0.5) converting water to steam (currently has coal fuel)\n- Steam engine at (-0.5,-0.5) generating electricity\n- Pipe network connecting the components (currently not fully functional)\n\n### Iron Smelting Furnace at (16.0,76.0)\n- Stone furnace at (16.0,76.0) (currently not operational due to lack of fuel and input materials)\n\n### New Power Generation Attempts\n1. At (-9.5,19.5):\n   - Offshore pump at (-9.5,19.5)\n   - Boiler at (0.0,30.5)\n   - Steam engine at (5.5,30.5) (not connected)\n\n2. At (40.0,40.5):\n   - Boiler at (40.0,40.5)\n\n3. At (50.5,50.0):\n   - Boiler at (50.5,50.0) facing UP\n\n4. At (60.0,60.5):\n   - Boiler at (60.0,60.5) facing RIGHT\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Power System Placement Issues\n- Steam engines cannot be placed on water tiles - verify terrain before placement\n- Maintain proper spacing (2 tiles) between boiler and steam engine\n- Check for existing entities before placing new components\n\n### Boiler Placement Problems\n- Ensure boilers are placed on land, not water\n- Verify clear space in all directions when placing boilers\n- Check for existing entities that might block placement\n\n### Water Source Verification\n- Always verify water exists at target location before placing offshore pump\n- Use get_resource_patch() to confirm water availability\n- Offshore pumps must be placed directly adjacent to water\n\n### Component Connection Issues\n- Ensure all power plant components are properly connected with pipes\n- Verify steam engine placement aligns with boiler output direction\n- Check that all components are on the same power network\n\n### Placement Direction Considerations\n- Pay attention to entity facing directions when placing\n- Ensure steam engine placement aligns with boiler output direction\n- Verify pipe connections match component orientations\n\n### Power Network Verification\n- Check that all electrical consumers are connected to power poles\n- Verify steam engines show WORKING status\n- Monitor power production vs consumption\n\n### Entity Collision Prevention\n- Maintain sufficient spacing between power plant components\n- Check for existing entities before placement attempts\n- Consider using grid-aligned placement coordinates"}
