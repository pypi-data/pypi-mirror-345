{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0), extracting iron ore and dropping it into a chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5), storing extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-14.5, y=-46.5), intended to transfer iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0), intended for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Alignment\n- Ensure that the inserter's pickup position is correctly aligned with the chest's position. Misalignment can prevent the inserter from picking up items. Verify that the inserter's pickup and drop positions match the intended source and destination entities.\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities\n- Before placing an entity, check for potential collisions with existing entities or unsuitable terrain (e.g., water). Adjust the spacing, direction, or reference position to avoid placement errors.\n\n### Errors with Fuel Management\n- Ensure that there is sufficient fuel (e.g., coal) in your inventory before attempting to refuel entities. Regularly check and replenish fuel supplies to maintain continuous operation of drills and inserters."}
