{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(2.5, 2.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Electric poles at positions (2.5, 2.5) and (0.5, 1.5)\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (0, 0) and a furnace at position (0, 0)\n- Burner mining drill at position (2, 0) and a furnace at position (2, 0)\n\n### Copper cable factory at position(3.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine at position (3.5, 0.5) and inserter that puts into the assembling machine\n- Beltgroup that connects the furnace at position (2, 0) to the assembling machine at position (3.5, 0.5)\n\n### Lab at position(2, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab at position (2, 0) which requires 10 automation science packs to complete Automation research and is currently not powered.\n\n### Storage chest at position(3.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest at position (3.5, 0.5) which currently has no items.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing new electric poles\n- Ensure you are using a valid Prototype object when attempting to place new poles. Check the API documentation for correct usage.\n\n### Errors when powering the lab\n- Make sure the lab is connected to a power source. Check the positioning of electric poles and ensure they are within range to provide power.\n\n### Errors due to lack of required ingredients\n- Ensure you have the necessary ingredients (in this case, 10 automation science packs) in your inventory before attempting to complete research.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity on a tile before attempting to place it. Check for existing entities in the target position."}
