{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-13.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0)\n- Burner Inserter at position (-14.5, -46.5)\n\nThis facility is responsible for extracting iron ore and converting it into iron plates. The mining drill extracts iron ore, which is then stored in the wooden chest. The burner inserter transfers the iron ore from the chest to the stone furnace, where it is smelted into iron plates.\n\n### Coal Extraction and Processing Facility at Position (43.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -80.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (43.0, -82.0)\n- Burner Inserter at position (43.5, -80.5)\n\nThis facility extracts coal and processes it for use as fuel. The mining drill extracts coal, which is stored in the wooden chest. The burner inserter transfers coal from the chest to the stone furnace for further processing or use as fuel.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied or unsuitable tiles\n- Ensure there is enough space and the correct direction when placing entities. If placement fails, consider increasing the spacing, changing the direction, or selecting a different reference position to avoid collisions with existing entities or unsuitable terrain.\n\n### Errors due to lack of resources in inventory\n- Before attempting to insert items into a furnace or other entities, verify that the required resources are available in your inventory to prevent operation failures."}
