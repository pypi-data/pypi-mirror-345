{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-4.5, 23.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Boiler (position -4.5, 23.0)\n- Offshore pump (position -7.5, 25.5)\n- Steam engine (position -0.5, -9.5)\n- Pipe groups connected to the boiler (various positions)\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 0, 0) and a furnace (position 0, 0)\n- Burner mining drill (position 5, 5) and a furnace (position 5, 5)\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine at position(z1) and inserter at position(a) that puts into assembling machine\n- Beltgroup (position) that connects the furnace at position y1 to assembling machine at position(z1)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to power connections\n- Ensure that all power-generating entities (like steam engines) are properly connected to a power network. Check the nearby electric poles and their connections.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it.\n\n### Errors related to fluid connections\n- Verify that all pipes are properly connected and that the required fluids are present in the system to avoid issues with fluid transfer."}
