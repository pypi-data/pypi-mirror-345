{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, y=-60.0) extracting iron ore. It is connected to:\n  - **Wooden Chest** at position (4.5, y=-58.5) storing iron ore.\n- **Stone Furnaces** for smelting iron ore into iron plates:\n  - Furnace at position (-15.0, y=-48.0) with a status of NO_INGREDIENTS.\n  - Furnace at position (-13.0, y=-48.0) with a status of WORKING.\n  - Furnace at position (-11.0, y=-48.0) with a status of WORKING.\n- **Wooden Chests** for storing iron plates:\n  - Chests at positions (-10.5, -50.5), (-9.5, -50.5), (-8.5, -50.5), (-7.5, -50.5), (-6.5, -50.5) storing varying amounts of iron plates.\n  - Chests at positions (5.5, -60.5), (6.5, -60.5), (7.5, -60.5), (8.5, -60.5), (9.5, -60.5) storing iron plates moved from the main storage.\n\n### Iron Ore Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (4.5, y=-58.5) storing iron ore.\n- **Iron Chest** at position (-5.5, y=-50.5) storing iron ore and iron plates.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors when extracting from a chest\n- Ensure that the chest is not empty before attempting to extract items. Verify the inventory of the chest to confirm the presence of items before extraction.\n\n### Errors due to full storage\n- Regularly monitor the storage chests to ensure they are not full. If a chest is full, transfer items to another storage to prevent interruptions in production.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - No specific utility functions were defined or invoked in the provided steps.\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `iron_ore_inventory: Dict[str, int]` - Represents the inventory of iron ore in various chests.\n  - `iron_plate_inventory: Dict[str, int]` - Represents the inventory of iron plates in various chests.\n  - `coal_inventory: Dict[str, int]` - Represents the inventory of coal in furnaces and drills."}
