{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-4.5, 23.0)\nConsists of boiler (position -4.5, 23.0), offshore pump (position -7.5, 25.5), and steam engine (position -0.5, -9.5). The boiler is currently working with full output, while the steam engine is not connected to a power network and has no input liquid.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 0.0, 0.0) and a furnace (position 0.0, 0.0)\n- Burner mining drill (position 5.0, 5.0) and a furnace (position 5.0, 5.0)\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine at position(z1) and inserter at position(a) that puts into assembling machine\n- Beltgroup (position ) that connects the furnace at position y1 to assembling machine at position(z1)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when trying to remove electric poles\n- Ensure that the electric pole you are trying to remove exists at the specified position before attempting to pick it up. Double-check the coordinates.\n\n### Errors when using undefined entities\n- Make sure that all necessary classes or modules are properly imported or defined before using them in your code. In this case, ensure that the 'Entity' class is defined in your script.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it."}
