{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Iron Smelting Facility at Position (61.0, -54.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (61.0, -54.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (61.5, -52.5)\n- Burner Inserter at position (62.5, -53.5) which transfers items from the furnace to the chest\n\n### Coal Mining and Transport System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) with an output chest at position (40.5, -83.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (40.5, -83.5) storing coal\n- Multiple BeltGroups facilitating coal transport:\n  - BeltGroup from (45.5, -82.5) to (48.5, -79.5)\n  - BeltGroup from (43.5, -80.5) to (63.5, -50.5)\n  - BeltGroup from (42.5, -81.5) to (65.5, -46.5)\n  - BeltGroup from (44.5, -81.5) to (65.5, -54.5)\n  - BeltGroup from (49.5, -80.5) to (60.5, -69.5)\n  - BeltGroup from (49.5, -78.5) to (58.5, -69.5)\n  - BeltGroup from (50.5, -79.5) to (59.5, -70.5)\n  - BeltGroup from (59.5, -68.5) to (67.5, -54.5)\n\n### Unpowered Inserter\n- Burner Inserter at position (50.5, -49.5) currently out of fuel\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Inventory Management Errors\n- Ensure there is enough space in the inventory before attempting to harvest or insert items. Consider dropping or using excess items to free up space.\n\n### Crafting and Resource Gathering Errors\n- Before crafting items like wooden chests, ensure all raw materials such as wood are available in the inventory. Gather necessary resources beforehand.\n\n### Placement and Insertion Errors\n- Verify that the target location for placing entities is available and that the inventory contains the required item before attempting to place it.\n- Ensure there is a nearby entity that can accept items when attempting to insert them.\n\n### Output Blockage and Extraction Errors\n- Regularly clear output blockages by ensuring that storage entities like chests are not full, allowing for smooth extraction and processing of materials.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- No utility functions were defined or invoked in the provided logs.\n- Important variables:\n  - `current_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the current inventory of the agent, including items like 'transport-belt', 'burner-inserter', 'stone-furnace', 'coal', 'iron-plate', and 'iron-gear-wheel'."}
