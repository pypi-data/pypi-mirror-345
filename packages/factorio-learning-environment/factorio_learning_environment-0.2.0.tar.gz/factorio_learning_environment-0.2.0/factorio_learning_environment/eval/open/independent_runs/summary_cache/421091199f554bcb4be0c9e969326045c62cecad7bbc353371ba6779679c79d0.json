{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(0.5, 6.0)\nConsists of boiler (position 0.5, 6.0) and steam engine (position 0.5, 0.5). The boiler requires water to operate and produces steam to power the steam engine.\n\n### Copper plate factory at position(-5.0, -65.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position -5.0, -65.0) which processes iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner mining drill (position 47.0, -82.0) that extracts iron ore from the ground.\n\n### Wooden chests\nMultiple wooden chests are located at various positions:\n- Chest at position (46.5, -83.5) contains coal.\n- Chest at position (48.5, -83.5) is empty.\n- Chest at position (5.5, -79.5) is empty.\n- Chest at position (10.5, -79.5) is empty.\n- Chest at position (-4.5, -63.5) is empty.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting Boiler and Steam Engine\n- Ensure that you have enough pipes in your inventory to connect the boiler and steam engine. Check your inventory before attempting to connect.\n\n### Errors when placing Offshore Pump\n- Ensure that the Offshore Pump is in your inventory before attempting to place it. If it is not available, gather the necessary resources to craft one.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it. Check for any existing entities that might block placement."}
