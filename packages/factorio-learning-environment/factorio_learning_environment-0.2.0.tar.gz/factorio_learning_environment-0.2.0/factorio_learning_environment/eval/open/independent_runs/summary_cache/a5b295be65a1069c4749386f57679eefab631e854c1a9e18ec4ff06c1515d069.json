{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-12.0, -48.0) and (-10.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (-12.0, -48.0) with a burner inserter at position (-13.5, -48.5) transferring items.\n- Furnace at position (-10.0, -48.0) with a burner inserter at position (-8.5, -47.5) transferring items.\n- Wooden chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) and (-15.5, -48.5) storing resources.\n- Burner mining drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) extracting resources.\n- Additional wooden chest at position (-6.5, -47.5) storing iron plates.\n\n### Resource Handling System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner inserter at position (-14.5, -47.5) transferring items between chests and furnaces.\n- Wooden chest at position (-14.5, -46.5) storing iron ore.\n- Burner inserter at position (-11.5, -45.5) awaiting source items.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Space in Destination\n- Ensure that the destination entity (e.g., chest or furnace) has enough space to accommodate the items being transferred by the inserter.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Verify that the source entity (e.g., chest or mining drill) has items available for the inserter to pick up. Ensure that the production line is not stalled due to lack of resources.\n\n### Furnace Output Blocked\n- Regularly transfer the output from furnaces to avoid production halts due to full output inventory. Consider using additional storage or more frequent item transfers.\n\n### Refueling Errors\n- Ensure that all fuel-consuming entities, such as furnaces and mining drills, are adequately refueled to maintain continuous operation. Regularly check and replenish coal or other fuel sources."}
