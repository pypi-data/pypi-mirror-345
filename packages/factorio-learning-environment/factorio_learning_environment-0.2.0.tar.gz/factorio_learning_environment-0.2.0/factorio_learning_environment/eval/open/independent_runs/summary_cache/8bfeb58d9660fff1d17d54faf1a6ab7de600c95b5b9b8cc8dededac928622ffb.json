{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) with coal fuel, connected to:\n- Stone Furnace at position (41.0, -80.0) with coal fuel, currently not smelting due to no ingredients.\n- Wooden Chest at position (43.5, -79.5) for storage.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) with no fuel, connected to:\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) for storing mined iron ore.\n\n### Copper Furnace at Position (-20.0, -71.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -71.0) with no fuel and no ingredients to smelt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Insufficient Inventory\n- Ensure that there is enough coal in your inventory before attempting to insert it into furnaces or drills. This will prevent errors like \"Could not insert: No coal to insert from your inventory.\"\n\n### Timeout Errors\n- Consider optimizing the code or logic to prevent timeout errors, which can occur if operations take too long to execute.\n\n### Furnace Warnings\n- Regularly check furnaces to ensure they have both fuel and ingredients to smelt. This will avoid warnings such as \"no ingredients to smelt\" and \"out of fuel.\"\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `insert_item`: Used to insert items into entities. Ensure that the source inventory has the required items before calling this function to avoid insertion errors.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `iron_furnace`: Represents the iron furnace entity, used in insertion operations."}
