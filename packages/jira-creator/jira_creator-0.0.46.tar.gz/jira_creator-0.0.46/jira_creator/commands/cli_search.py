"""
This module provides a command-line interface (CLI) function for searching JIRA issues using JIRA Query Language (JQL).

The `cli_search` function allows users to search for issues based on a specified JQL query through a JIRA client
instance. It retrieves relevant issue fields and displays the results in a formatted table. The function includes error
handling for search-related exceptions to ensure appropriate messages are displayed when issues arise.

Functions:
- cli_search(jira, args): Executes a search for issues in JIRA using the provided JQL query.

Arguments:
- jira: A JIRA client object for API communication.
- args: An object containing parsed command-line arguments, which must include a 'jql' attribute representing the JQL
query.

Exceptions:
- The function may raise exceptions related to the JIRA API or invalid queries.

Note:
- This script depends on external modules such as 'core.env_fetcher' and 'exceptions.exceptions' for environment
variable fetching and exception handling, respectively.
