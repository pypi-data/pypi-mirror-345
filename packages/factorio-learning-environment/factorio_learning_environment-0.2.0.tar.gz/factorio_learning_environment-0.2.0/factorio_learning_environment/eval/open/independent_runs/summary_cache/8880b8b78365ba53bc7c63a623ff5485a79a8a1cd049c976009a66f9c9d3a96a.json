{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Coal Mining Operation at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (41.0, -82.0)  \n- **Wooden Chest** at position (41.5, -80.5)  \n\nThe Burner Mining Drill is actively mining coal and dropping it into the Wooden Chest for storage.\n\n---\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when placing entities in non-buildable positions\n- Ensure the target position is clear and buildable before attempting to place entities like the **stone furnace** or **coal drill**.  \n  - Example: Attempted to place a stone furnace at (51.5, -79.0) and a coal drill at (43.5, -83.5), but both positions were not buildable.  \n\n#### Errors when inserting items into entities\n- Verify that the target entity exists and can accept the item before attempting to insert.  \n  - Example: Attempted to insert coal into a furnace, but no nearby furnace was found to accept the coal.  \n\n#### Errors due to undefined variables\n- Ensure all variables are properly defined before using them in conditional statements.  \n  - Example: Attempted to check `new_coal_drill`, but the variable was not defined.  \n\n#### Errors when extracting items\n- Ensure the target entity (e.g., chest) contains the item you are trying to extract.  \n  - Example: Extracted coal from a chest successfully, but ensure the chest has the required items before extraction.  \n\n#### General Tips\n- Double-check entity positions and ensure they are valid and accessible before performing actions.  \n- Use debugging tools or logs to verify the state of entities and inventory before executing commands."}
