{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5) and another at position (54.5, -84.5).\n- The chest at position (52.5, -84.5) is full, containing coal and copper ore, and the drill is waiting for space in the destination.\n\n### Iron Smelting Facility at Position (-20.0, -70.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -70.0) with no ingredients to smelt and a full fuel source.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-23.5, -69.5) containing copper ore.\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) out of fuel, connected to the chest at (-23.5, -69.5).\n\n### Iron Ore Processing and Storage Facility at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) out of fuel, connected to Wooden Chests at positions (-14.5, -54.5) and (-12.5, -54.5).\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5) waiting for source items, connected to the chests and the mining drill.\n\n### Copper Smelting Facility at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Wooden Chests at positions (0.5, -4.5), (0.5, -3.5), (0.5, -2.5), each containing copper ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) waiting for source items, connected to a Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5) and a Transport Belt group.\n\n### Transport Belt System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (1.5, 1.5) to (3.5, 1.5) and (2.5, 1.5) to (4.5, 1.5).\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (3.5, 2.5) to (5.5, 2.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### TypeError: 'Chest' object is not callable\n- Ensure that the correct method is used to interact with entities. The error suggests that a 'Chest' object was mistakenly used as a callable function. Double-check the API documentation for the correct usage of entity interactions.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
