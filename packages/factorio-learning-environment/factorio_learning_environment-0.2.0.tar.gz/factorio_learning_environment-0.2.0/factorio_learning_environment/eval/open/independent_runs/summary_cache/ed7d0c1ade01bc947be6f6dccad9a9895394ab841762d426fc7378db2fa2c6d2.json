{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnace 1** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with 8 units of coal, currently working and producing iron plates from iron ore.\n- **Furnace 2** at position (x=2.0, y=0.0) with 3 units of coal, currently not working due to no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Coal Mining and Distribution System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0) with 17 units of coal, currently out of fuel.\n- **Burner Inserter 1** at position (x=41.5, y=-83.5), waiting for source items, moves coal from the mining drill to a wooden chest.\n- **Burner Inserter 2** at position (x=41.5, y=-80.5), waiting for source items, moves coal from a wooden chest to another location.\n- **Wooden Chest 1** at position (x=40.5, y=-83.5), connected to the burner mining drill and burner inserter 1.\n- **Wooden Chest 2** at position (x=42.5, y=-83.5), stores 26 units of coal.\n- **Wooden Chest 3** at position (x=46.5, y=-83.5), currently empty.\n- **Wooden Chest 4** at position (x=41.5, y=-79.5), stores 691 units of coal.\n\n### Coal Transport Belt System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Belt Group** from position (x=42.5, y=-83.5) to (x=45.5, y=-83.5), transporting coal with 8 units in inventory.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to fuel management\n- Ensure that all burner entities such as mining drills and furnaces have a sufficient supply of fuel to avoid interruptions in production.\n\n### Errors when inserters are waiting for source items\n- Verify that the source entity for inserters has items available to be moved. This can be due to a lack of production or misalignment of the inserter.\n\n### Errors due to no ingredients in furnaces\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. This may involve checking the supply chain to ensure raw materials are being delivered efficiently."}
