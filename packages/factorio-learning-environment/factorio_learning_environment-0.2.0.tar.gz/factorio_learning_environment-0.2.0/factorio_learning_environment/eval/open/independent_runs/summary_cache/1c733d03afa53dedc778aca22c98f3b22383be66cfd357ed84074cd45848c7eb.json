{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-44.5, -124.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (-40.5, -113.5)\n- Pipe connections between these components\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-15.0, -76.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at Position (-15.5, -77.5)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-19.0, -73.0)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0)\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) connected to a Wooden Chest at Position (6.5, -59.5)\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of:\n- Small Electric Poles connecting various entities, including the Inserter and Lab\n\n### Lab Facility\nConsists of:\n- Lab with input of automation-science-pack at Position (not specified)\n\n### Pipe Networks\nMultiple Pipe Groups with varying statuses (Full Output, Empty) across the map, connecting various fluid systems.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Connection Errors with Pipes\n- Ensure that pipes are correctly aligned and connected between the offshore pump and boiler. Verify that all necessary connections are clear and not obstructed.\n\n### Incorrect Argument Type in API Calls\n- When using the `insert_item` function, ensure that the second argument is an Entity or EntityGroup, not a Position. Double-check the function parameters to prevent AssertionErrors.\n\n### Power Connection Issues\n- Verify that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to connect power lines. Ensure that all poles are within range and properly connected to the power network.\n\n### Full Inventory Warnings\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are full to prevent mining drills from stopping due to lack of space.\n\n### No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt by checking their input inventories regularly."}
