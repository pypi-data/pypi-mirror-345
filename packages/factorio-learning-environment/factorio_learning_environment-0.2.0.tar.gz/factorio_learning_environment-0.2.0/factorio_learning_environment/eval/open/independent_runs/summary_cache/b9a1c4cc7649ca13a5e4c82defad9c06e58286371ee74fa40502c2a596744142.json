Multiple attempts were made to locate, craft, and place this Lab; however, none succeeded because of resource shortages and errors during its assembly. No new structures have been successfully established on the map.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 API Parameter Usage\n  - When calling get_entities(), ensure the function is invoked with its correct signature. Avoid using unsupported keyword arguments (such as \u201cradius\u201d) or providing extra positional parameters that the API does not expect.\n\n\u2022 Inventory Verification for Placement\n  - Before attempting to place a structure (e.g., the Lab), confirm that the required item is present in the inventory to avoid placement failures.\n\n\u2022 Handling Missing or Nil Entity Lists\n  - When filtering or iterating over entities returned from a lookup function, safeguard against None values by substituting with an empty list if necessary.\n\n\u2022 Crafting Resource Dependencies\n  - Prior to initiating Lab crafting, verify that all sub-ingredients (for example, iron plates, iron\u2010gear\u2010wheels, copper plates/cables, and electronic circuits) are available. Address shortages by ensuring proper smelting or gathering processes are completed.\n\n\u2022 Sequential Resolution of Crafting Failures\n  - Resolve missing intermediate components step by step. For instance, if lab crafting fails due to a shortfall in iron-gear-wheels or copper-cable production, perform the necessary resource conversions before reattempting the craft."}
