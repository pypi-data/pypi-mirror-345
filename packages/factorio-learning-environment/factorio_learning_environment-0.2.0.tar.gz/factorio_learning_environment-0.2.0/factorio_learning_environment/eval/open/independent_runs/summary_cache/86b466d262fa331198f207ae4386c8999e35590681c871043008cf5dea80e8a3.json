{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0), responsible for extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5), used to store extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5), aligned to transfer iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0), intended for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Misalignment Issues\n- Ensure that the inserter's pickup and drop positions are correctly aligned with the source and destination entities. Regularly check and adjust inserter alignment to ensure efficient transfer of materials.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Verify that the source entity (e.g., chest) contains the necessary items for the inserter to transfer. Ensure that the inserter is correctly positioned to pick up items from the source.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Ingredients\n- Check the setup of inserters and ensure that they are correctly transferring materials into the furnace. Confirm that the furnace has the necessary ingredients to process.\n\n### Refueling Errors\n- Ensure that there is sufficient coal in the inventory to refuel inserters and mining drills. Regularly monitor fuel levels and replenish as needed to maintain continuous operation."}
