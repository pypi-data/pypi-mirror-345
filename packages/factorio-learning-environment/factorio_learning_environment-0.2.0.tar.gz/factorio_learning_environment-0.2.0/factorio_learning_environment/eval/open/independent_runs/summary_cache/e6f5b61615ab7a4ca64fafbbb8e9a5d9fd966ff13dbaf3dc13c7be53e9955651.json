{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-13.5, 20.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Boiler at position(-13.5, 20.0)\n- Offshore pump at position(-10.5, 25.5)\n- Small electric poles at positions (-15.5, 19.5), (-15.5, 18.5)\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(-18.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position(-18.0, -49.0) and a furnace at position(-18.0, -49.0)\n\n### Iron plate factory at position(5.0, -73.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position(5.0, -73.0)\n\n### Lab at position(-21.5, 25.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab at position(-21.5, 25.5)\n\n### Assembling machine at position(-21.5, 25.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine at position(-21.5, 25.5)\n\n### Pipe network\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Pipe groups at positions (-11.5, 20.5) and (-4.5, 21.5)\n\n### Electricity network\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Electricity group at position(229346), with small electric poles at positions (-17.5, 26.5), (-16.5, 26.5), (-21.5, 22.5), (-23.5, 23.5), (-20.5, 23.5), (-21.5, 23.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to electric pole attributes\n- Ensure that you are accessing valid attributes of entities. In this case, the 'ElectricityGroup' does not have an 'energy' attribute. Verify the entity's documentation for available attributes.\n\n### Errors when trying to access entities at specific positions\n- Make sure the entity you are trying to access exists at the specified position. In this case, the lab entity was not found at position (-21.5, 25.5). Double-check the position and ensure the entity is placed correctly before attempting to access it.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing. This includes checking for existing entities in the desired location."}
