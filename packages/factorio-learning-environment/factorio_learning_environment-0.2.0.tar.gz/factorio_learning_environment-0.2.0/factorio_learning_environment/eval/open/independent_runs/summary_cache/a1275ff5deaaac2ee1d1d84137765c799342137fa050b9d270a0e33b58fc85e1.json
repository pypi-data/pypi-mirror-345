{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System (Updated)\n- **Offshore pump** at (-21.5, -2.5) - New placement but showing \"no fluid present\" warning\n- **Boiler** - Multiple placement attempts failed (Steps 96-103)\n- **Steam engine** at (22.5, 22.5) - Still disconnected from power network\n\n### Oil Production Complex\n- **Oil refinery** at (27.5, 40.5) - Powered but showing NO_POWER status\n- **Chemical plant** at (37.5, 22.5) - Configured for sulfur production but lacks power\n- **Storage tank** at (32.5, 22.5) - Empty and unused\n\n### New Water Infrastructure Attempts\n- Multiple offshore pump placements attempted between (-11.0,0.0) and (-21.5,-2.5)\n- No successful boiler connections established in recent steps\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Persistent Placement Issues (Updated)\n- **Water detection failures** - Still attempting placements without proper water verification (Steps 97,103)\n- **Position validation** - Boiler placement attempts overlapping water (Steps 100,102)\n- **Distance miscalculations** - Placement attempts beyond maximum range (Step 98)\n\n### New System Implementation Problems\n- **Obstacle detection** - Underground pipe placement failing due to existing objects (Step 99)\n- **Position calculation** - Still asserting boiler_pos without fallback (Steps 96,101)\n- **Water boundary checks** - Not verifying sufficient land clearance (Steps 100,102)\n\n### Critical System Design Flaws\n- **No progress tracking** - Repeatedly clearing infrastructure without completing systems\n- **No backup plans** - No alternative strategies when primary placement fails\n- **No entity verification** - Still not confirming successful placements before proceeding\n\n### Power System Issues\n- **Network isolation** - Steam engine remains disconnected despite nearby poles\n- **Voltage monitoring** - Still not implemented (current network voltage at 0)\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Functions\n- `connect_fluid_system()` - Needs obstacle detection enhancement\n- `verify_power_connection()` - Still missing voltage checks\n- `find_clear_path()` - New function needed based on obstacle patterns\n- `find_water_free_position()` - New requirement from recent failures\n\n### Variables\n- `water_pos` - Now at (-21.5, -2.5) but non-functional\n- `boiler_pos` - Still causing assertion errors\n- `obstacle_positions` - Needs expansion for water boundary detection\n- `placement_attempts` - New counter variable needed for retry logic"}
