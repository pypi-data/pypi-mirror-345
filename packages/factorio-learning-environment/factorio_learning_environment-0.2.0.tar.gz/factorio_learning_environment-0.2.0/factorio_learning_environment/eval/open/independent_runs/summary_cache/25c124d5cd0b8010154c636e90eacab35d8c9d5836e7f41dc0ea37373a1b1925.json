{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at position (-14.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-12.0, -51.0) which extracts iron ore and drops it into a chest at position (-11.5, -49.5).\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-11.5, -49.5) stores extracted iron ore.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-14.0, -49.0) which processes iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserters** at positions (-11.5, -48.5), (-8.5, -48.5), and (-13.5, -46.5) which are responsible for moving items between entities, though currently waiting for source items.\n\n### Coal Mining Facility at position (52.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (52.0, -82.0) which extracts coal and drops it into a chest at position (53.5, -80.5).\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (53.5, -80.5) stores extracted coal.\n- **Burner Inserters** at positions (52.5, -79.5) and (52.5, -76.5) which move coal between entities, though some are waiting for source items.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entities for inserters have items available to be moved. Check for blockages or ensure that the source entities are functioning correctly and producing items.\n\n### Chest Full Warning\n- Regularly empty chests to prevent mining drills from halting operations due to full storage. Specifically, ensure the chest at (-11.5, -49.5) is emptied to continue mining operations.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- None defined or invoked in the logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `current_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the current inventory of the agent, including items like 'wooden-chest', 'wood', 'coal', 'iron-ore', and 'iron-plate'."}
