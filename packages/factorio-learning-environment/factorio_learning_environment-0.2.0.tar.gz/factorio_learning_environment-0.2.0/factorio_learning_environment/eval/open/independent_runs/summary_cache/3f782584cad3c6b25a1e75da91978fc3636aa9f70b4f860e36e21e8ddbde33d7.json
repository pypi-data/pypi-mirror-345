{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Patch at position(40.5, -82.5)\n- The agent has harvested coal from this location, which is a resource used for fueling various machines.\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position(-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position -15.0, -50.0) which is currently extracting resources.\n- Wooden Chest (position -14.5, -48.5) for storing extracted iron ore.\n- The drill has a warning indicating that the chest at drop position is full, which may hinder further extraction.\n\n### Stone Furnace at position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace (position 0.0, 0.0) which is currently fueled with coal but has warnings indicating no ingredients to smelt and that the furnace result is full.\n- The furnace is connected to a Wooden Chest (position 2.5, 0.5) that contains iron ore and iron plates.\n\n### Wooden Chest at position(2.5, 0.5)\n- This chest is storing iron ore and iron plates, serving as a storage solution for the output of the furnace.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to full storage\n- The warning from the Burner Mining Drill indicates that the chest at (-14.5, -48.5) is full. To mitigate this, ensure to regularly empty chests or increase storage capacity to prevent interruptions in resource extraction.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Ensure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- **Functions Defined**: None noted in the logs.\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `coal`: int\n  - `iron-ore`: int\n  - `wood`: int\n  - `furnace_status`: str\n  - `drill_status`: str\n  - `chest_status`: str"}
