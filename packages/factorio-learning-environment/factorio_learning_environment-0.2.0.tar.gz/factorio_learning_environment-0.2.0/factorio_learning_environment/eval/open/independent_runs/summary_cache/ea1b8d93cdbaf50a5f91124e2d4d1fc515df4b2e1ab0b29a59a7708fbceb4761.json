For instance, attempting to insert coal when there is none in your inventory will result in an error.\n\n### Errors due to blocked outputs\n- Make sure that the output of a mining drill or any production entity is not blocked by items on the ground. Ensure there is a sink entity, such as a chest or conveyor belt, to accept the output.\n\n### Errors when furnace is not receiving ingredients\n- Verify that the furnace has a consistent supply of required ingredients (e.g., iron ore) to maintain production. Ensure that inserters are correctly positioned and fueled to transfer items into the furnace.\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied or invalid tiles\n- Ensure that the placement position for an entity is not occupied by another entity or is a valid tile. Adjust the spacing, direction, or reference position to avoid collisions or invalid placements."}
