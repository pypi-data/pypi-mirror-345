{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) fueled with coal, extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) and (x=-15.5, y=-48.5) for storing extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0) processing iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5) transferring iron ore from the chest to another location.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-46.5) storing additional iron ore.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-10.0, y=-48.0) processing iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-8.5, y=-47.5) transferring items between entities.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when extracting items from non-existent entities\n- Ensure that the target entity exists and contains the specified items before attempting to extract. Verify the entity's position and inventory contents.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into entities without available items\n- Before inserting items, confirm that your inventory contains the necessary items. Regularly check your inventory to avoid attempting to insert non-existent items.\n\n### Errors when inserters have no source items\n- Ensure that the source entity for the inserter contains items. Regularly monitor the supply chain to prevent inserters from idling due to lack of source items."}
