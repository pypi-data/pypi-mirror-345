{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (5.5, 26.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (5.5, 26.5)\n- Connected to multiple electric poles at positions:\n  - (19.5, 16.5)\n  - (26.5, 17.5)\n  - (30.5, 17.5)\n  - (21.5, 27.5)\n  - (27.5, 26.5)\n  - (5.5, 29.5)\n  - (12.5, 23.5)\n  - (24.5, 22.5)\n  - (35.5, 20.5)\n  - (1.5, 14.5)\n  - (17.5, 14.5)\n  - (10.5, 17.5)\n  - (20.5, 19.5)\n\n### Boiler System\n- Boiler at position (-3.5, 26.0) refueled with coal.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure that the pipe connections are correctly aligned and that there is a valid path between the boiler output and the steam engine. The error indicates a failure to connect pipes, which may be due to incorrect positioning or missing entities in the path.\n\n### Errors in Using Underground Pipes\n- When attempting to connect using both `Pipe` and `UndergroundPipe`, ensure that the entities are properly placed and that the connection path is clear and valid. Misalignment or incorrect placement can lead to connection failures.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Defined Functions\n- `connect_entities`: Attempts to connect two entities using specified prototypes (e.g., Pipe, UndergroundPipe). \n\n### Variables\n- `pipe_group`: (Type: ConnectionGroup) Holds the group of connected pipes, initialized when attempting to connect entities.\n- `boiler_output_position`: (Type: Position) Represents the output position of the boiler for pipe connections.\n- `steam_engine`: (Type: Entity) Represents the steam engine entity to which connections are attempted. \n\nThe agent should ensure that the entities are correctly positioned and that the connection paths are valid to avoid repeated connection errors."}
