{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Furnace at position (-15.0, -50.0)\n- **Entities**:\n  - Stone furnace (position: x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n- **Use-case**: Smelting iron ore into iron plates using coal as fuel.\n\n---\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when placing entities without required items in inventory\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to place an entity. For example, placing a stone furnace requires 5 stone. Check your inventory and craft the necessary items beforehand.\n\n#### Errors when inserting items into entities without sufficient inventory\n- Always verify that you have the required items in your inventory before inserting them into entities like furnaces. For example, inserting iron ore or coal into a furnace requires having those items in your inventory.\n\n#### Errors when extracting items from entities without sufficient output\n- Ensure the entity has produced enough output before attempting to extract items. For example, extracting iron plates from a furnace requires the furnace to have completed smelting.\n\n#### Errors when crafting items without sufficient resources\n- Verify that you have the necessary resources in your inventory before attempting to craft items. For example, crafting a stone furnace requires 5 stone.\n\n#### Errors when smelting due to insufficient fuel or inputs\n- Ensure the furnace has both sufficient fuel (e.g., coal) and input materials (e.g., iron ore) before starting the smelting process. Monitor the furnace status to avoid smelting timeouts.\n\n#### Errors when attempting to place entities in occupied tiles\n- Check the target position to ensure it is not already occupied by another entity before placing a new entity. For example, placing a furnace on a tile already occupied by another structure will fail.\n\n#### Errors when extracting items with invalid quantities\n- Ensure the quantity of items to extract is greater than 0 and does not exceed the available amount in the entity. For example, attempting to extract 0 iron plates will result in an error.\n\n#### Errors when harvesting resources without sufficient inventory space\n- Ensure you have enough inventory space before harvesting resources. For example, harvesting iron ore without sufficient space will result in an error.\n\n#### Errors when verifying entity existence or status\n- Always verify the existence and status of an entity before interacting with it. For example, ensure the furnace exists and is in a working state before inserting or extracting items."}
