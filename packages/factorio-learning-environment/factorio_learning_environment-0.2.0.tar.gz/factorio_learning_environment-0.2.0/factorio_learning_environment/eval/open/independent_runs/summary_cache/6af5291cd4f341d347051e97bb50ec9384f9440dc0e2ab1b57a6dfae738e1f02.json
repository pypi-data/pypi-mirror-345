Always route the belt to an inserter that feeds the engine.\n\u2003\n\u2013 Placement Range Errors:\n\u2003\u2022 When a placement error indicates the target is too far (e.g. wooden-chest at (3.5,15.5) with player at (0,0)), move closer so that the target position is within the permissible range.\n\u2003\n\u2013 Undefined Variable Errors:\n\u2003\u2022 Ensure that all referenced variables (for example, 'target_chest') are properly defined before use to avoid NameError issues.\n\u2003\n\u2013 Inventory Shortage Errors:\n\u2003\u2022 Before placing an entity (such as a wooden chest), verify that the item is available in the inventory.\n"}
