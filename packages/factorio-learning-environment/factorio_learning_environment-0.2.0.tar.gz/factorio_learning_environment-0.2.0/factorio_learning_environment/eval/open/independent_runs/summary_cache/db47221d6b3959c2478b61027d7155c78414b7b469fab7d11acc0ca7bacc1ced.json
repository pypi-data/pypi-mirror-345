All attempts to place entities have failed, resulting in no entities being present on the map.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure the target tile is not occupied or obstructed before attempting to place an entity. Multiple attempts to place a Wooden Chest and a Stone Furnace failed due to obstructions or occupied tiles.\n\n### Errors in movement commands\n- When using the `move_to` function, ensure that the indices provided are integers. Errors occurred due to incorrect data types being used as indices in movement commands."}
