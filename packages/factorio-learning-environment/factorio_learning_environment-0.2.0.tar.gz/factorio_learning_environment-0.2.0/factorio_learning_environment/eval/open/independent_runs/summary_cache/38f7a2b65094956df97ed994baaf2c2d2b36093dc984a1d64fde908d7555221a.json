{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) with coal fuel, currently working and connected to:\n- Stone Furnace at position (41.0, -80.0) with coal fuel, but currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility at Position (-21.0, -73.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-21.0, -73.0) with coal fuel, currently working but output is blocked due to no sink entity in place to accept the output. Connected to:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -71.0) with coal fuel, but currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors when extracting from a non-existent entity\n- Ensure that the entity from which you are trying to extract resources exists and contains the resources. For example, the error at position (41.0, -82.0) indicates that the burner-mining-drill does not contain iron-ore. Verify the presence and content of the entity before attempting extraction.\n\n### Errors due to blocked output\n- Ensure that there is a valid sink entity to accept the output from mining drills. The copper mining drill at position (-21.0, -73.0) has its output blocked. Make sure to place a connected entity like a furnace or a conveyor belt to handle the output.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - `extract_item`: Attempts to extract a specified quantity of a resource from an entity. Ensure the entity contains the resource and is correctly identified.\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `iron_ore_quantity`: Intended to store the quantity of iron ore extracted, but extraction failed due to the absence of iron ore in the specified mining drill."}
