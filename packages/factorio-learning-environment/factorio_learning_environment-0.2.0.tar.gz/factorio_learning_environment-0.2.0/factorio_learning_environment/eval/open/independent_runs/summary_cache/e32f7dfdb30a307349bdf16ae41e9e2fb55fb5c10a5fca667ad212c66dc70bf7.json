{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Furnace at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\n- Consists of a stone furnace fueled by coal, with a current energy level of 1600.0.\n- Status indicates \"no ingredients to smelt\" and \"furnace fuel source is full\".\n- Producing iron plates with a current inventory of 21 iron plates.\n\n### Pipe Network at Position (x=-12.5, y=21.5)\n- A group of pipes forming a fluid system with ID 9787.\n- Pipes are positioned at: (x=-12.5, y=21.5), (x=-11.5, y=21.5), (x=-11.5, y=22.5), (x=-10.5, y=22.5), (x=-10.5, y=23.5), (x=-9.5, y=23.5).\n- The system is currently empty.\n\n### Electricity Network\n- An electricity group with ID 51891.\n- Electric poles are positioned at: (x=-4.5, y=22.5), (x=-3.5, y=22.5), (x=-0.5, y=22.5), ..., (x=-3.5, y=21.5), (x=-1.5, y=21.5), (x=-0.5, y=21.5).\n- Current voltage is 0, indicating no power is being generated or distributed.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Offshore Pump Placement\n- Ensure the position for placing an offshore pump is suitable and adjacent to a water source. Verify the terrain and proximity to water before attempting placement.\n\n### Errors with Boiler Placement\n- Verify that the position for placing a boiler is suitable and clear of obstructions. Ensure the terrain supports the placement of the boiler.\n\n### Connection Failures\n- When connecting pipes or electric poles, ensure that the entities are placed correctly and that there are no gaps or misalignments in the network.\n\n### Validation Errors for Building Dimensions\n- Ensure that the dimensions for buildings are specified as valid integers. Review the input data for building dimensions to prevent validation errors.\n\n### Movement Errors\n- When moving to a new area, ensure that the target indices are integers. Avoid using string indices for movement operations."}
