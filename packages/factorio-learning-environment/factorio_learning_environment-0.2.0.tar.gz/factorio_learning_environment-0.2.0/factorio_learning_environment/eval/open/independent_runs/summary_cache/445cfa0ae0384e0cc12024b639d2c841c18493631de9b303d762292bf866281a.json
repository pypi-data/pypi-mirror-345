{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) with coal as fuel, actively mining iron ore. The drill is currently working but has a warning indicating that the chest at the drop position is full.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5) storing iron ore. The chest is connected to the mining drill and is currently full, containing 42 units of iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5) intended to transfer iron ore from the chest to the furnace. The inserter has been repositioned multiple times to align correctly but is currently out of fuel and waiting for source items.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0) intended for smelting iron ore into iron plates. The furnace is fueled but not receiving iron ore, resulting in a status of no ingredients to smelt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Alignment and Fueling\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items from the chest to the furnace. Regularly check the inserter's alignment and reposition if necessary.\n- Keep the inserter fueled to maintain continuous operation. Monitor fuel levels and refuel as needed to prevent stoppages.\n\n### Errors with Chest Management\n- Regularly check the chest's capacity to prevent it from becoming full, which halts the mining operation. Extract items from the chest to free up space and allow continuous mining.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Operations\n- Ensure that the furnace is receiving the necessary ingredients (iron ore) for smelting. Check the inserter setup and alignment to resolve issues with ingredient transfer.\n\n### Errors in Crafting Operations\n- Understand that coal is a raw resource that must be gathered and cannot be crafted. Avoid attempting to craft coal and instead gather it directly from the environment."}
