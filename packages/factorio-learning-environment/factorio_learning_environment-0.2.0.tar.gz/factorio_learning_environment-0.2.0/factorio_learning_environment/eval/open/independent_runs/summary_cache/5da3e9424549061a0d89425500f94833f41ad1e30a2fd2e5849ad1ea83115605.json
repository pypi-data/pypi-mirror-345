For example, ensure you have a lab in your inventory before trying to place it.\n\n### Errors When Finding Nearest Power Source\n- Ensure that the power source, such as a steam engine, exists on the map before trying to find it. This will prevent errors related to missing entities.\n\n### Errors Related to No Power\n- Ensure that your lab and other power-dependent structures are connected to a power source to avoid operational interruptions."}
