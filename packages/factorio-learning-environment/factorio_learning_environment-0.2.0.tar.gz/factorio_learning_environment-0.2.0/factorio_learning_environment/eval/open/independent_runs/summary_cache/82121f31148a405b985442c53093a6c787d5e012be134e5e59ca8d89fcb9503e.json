{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position(-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (position -15.0, -50.0) fueled with coal.\n- Wooden chest (position -14.5, -48.5) that stores iron ore.\n- The drill is currently operational but has a warning indicating that the chest at the drop position is full.\n\n### Stone Furnace at position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace (position 0.0, 0.0) which currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n- **Errors inserting iron ore**: \n  - The agent repeatedly encountered errors when attempting to insert iron ore into the furnace. This occurred because the agent had no iron ore in its inventory. \n  - **Tip**: Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into any structure.\n\n- **Furnace status after refueling**: \n  - The furnace consistently reported \"EntityStatus.NO_INGREDIENTS\" after attempts to refuel. \n  - **Tip**: Check the inventory of the furnace to ensure it has the necessary ingredients to operate.\n\n- **Chest at drop position is full**: \n  - The burner mining drill reported that the chest at the drop position is full. \n  - **Tip**: Regularly empty the chest to ensure the mining drill can continue to operate effectively.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions**: \n  - None defined or invoked in the current execution steps.\n\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `current_inventory`: Dictionary[str, int] = {'wood': 6}\n  - `chest_inventory`: Dictionary[str, int] = {'iron-ore': 292} (at the last step)\n  - `furnace_status`: EntityStatus = EntityStatus.NO_INGREDIENTS (after multiple refuels)"}
