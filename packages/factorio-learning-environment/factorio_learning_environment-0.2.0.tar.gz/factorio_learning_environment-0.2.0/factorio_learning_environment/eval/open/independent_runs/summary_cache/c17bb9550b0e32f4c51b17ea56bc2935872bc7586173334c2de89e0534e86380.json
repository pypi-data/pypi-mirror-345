{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n###Power Generation System (Incomplete/Not Working)\nConsists of:\n- Steam engine at position (-4.5, 14.5)\n- Boiler at position (-2.5, 24.0)\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\nMultiple attempts to connect these with pipes were made but failed due to placement issues.\n\n###Manufacturing Area\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine 1 at position (23.5, 2.5) for crafting inserters\n- Input wooden chest at (20.5, 2.5) containing 36 inserters\n- Output wooden chest at (26.5, 2.5)\n- Two burner inserters at (21.5, 2.5) and (25.5, 2.5) for automation\n\n###Science Pack Production\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine 1 at position (32.5, 5.5) for crafting logistic science packs\n- Multiple labs with various science pack inputs:\n  - Lab with 1 automation + 4 logistic science packs\n  - Lab with 2 automation + 2 logistic science packs\n  - Lab with 40 logistic science packs\n  - Several empty labs\n\n###Smelting Area\nConsists of:\n- Furnace at (0.0, 0.0)\n- Furnace at (2.0, 0.0) with coal fuel and iron plate output\n- Furnace at (4.0, 4.0) with coal fuel\n- Furnace at (6.0, 4.0)\n\n###Storage\n- Wooden chest at (-4.5, 25.5) near the boiler\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing pipes near existing structures\n- Before placing pipes, verify there is clear space in the target location\n- Check for overlapping entity footprints, especially around steam engines and boilers\n- Consider using underground pipes to bypass occupied areas\n\n### Errors when placing pipes over water\n- Avoid placing pipe-to-ground entities directly over water tiles\n- Place offshore pumps first, then connect regular pipes to their output\n\n### Entity connection errors\n- Ensure all fluid-carrying entities (boilers, steam engines, pipes) form complete, unbroken connections\n- Verify pipe networks are properly connected between power system components\n- Check that steam and water pipe networks are properly separated and connected to correct inputs/outputs\n\n### Power system errors\n- Ensure complete fluid flow path from water pump through boiler to steam engine\n- Verify boiler has both water input and steam output connections\n- Make sure steam engine has proper steam input connection"}
