Adjust spacing, direction, or reference position to avoid clashes with existing transport belts or inserters.\n\u2022 Belt Connection Validity:\n\u2003\u2013 When attempting to join belt segments, ensure there is an unobstructed, continuous path between the source and destination. Errors in connecting segments indicate invalid or blocked paths.\n\u2022 Inventory Verification:\n\u2003\u2013 Confirm that required items (for example, burner-inserters) are available in the inventory prior to repositioning or placement actions.\n\u2022 Entity Removal and Downstream Effects:\n\u2003\u2013 If a conflicting entity (such as a transport belt) is removed to clear the placement area, ensure no residual conflicts remain that might prevent subsequent placements.\n\nNAMESPACE\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nshift_entity_local(entity: Entity, offset: Tuple[float, float]) -> Entity\n\u2003\u2022 Shifts the given entity\u2019s position locally by the specified offset.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Previously used successfully; note potential repositioning issues.\nImportant Variables:\n\u2022 furnace_input_chest_pos (Position) \u2013 holds the position of the furnace\u2019s input chest.\n\u2022 current_player_inventory (Inventory) \u2013 tracks the player\u2019s inventory state."}
