{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (10.5, 34.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (10.5, 34.5), currently not connected to the power network and without input liquid.\n- Small Electric Poles at positions (10.5, 31.5) and (12.5, 34.5).\n- Pipes at positions (8.5, 34.5), (8.5, 37.5), and (9.5, 37.5).\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (15.0, 0.0), currently without ingredients to smelt.\n- Inserters at positions (16.5, 0.5) and (17.5, 0.5), both not receiving electricity.\n- Wooden Chests at positions (5.5, 0.5) and (18.5, 0.5).\n\n### Water Supply System\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-7.5, 25.5) connected to a series of pipes, providing water to the system.\n- Boiler at position (-1.5, 27.0) with a full output of steam.\n- Pipe groups connecting various parts of the water supply system, ensuring fluid distribution.\n\n### Additional Pipe Groups\n- Multiple pipe groups at various positions, including (-12.5, 18.5), (-11.5, 19.5), (-12.5, 21.5), (-9.5, 23.5), and (1.5, 29.5), facilitating fluid movement across the map.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors When Placing Pipes\n- Ensure you are within the maximum placement distance (10 units) from the target position before attempting to place pipes. Move closer to the target position if necessary.\n\n### Errors Due to Obstructions\n- Verify that the target tile is clear of any existing objects before placing a new entity. Remove any obstructions to avoid placement errors.\n\n### Electricity Connectivity Issues\n- Regularly check the connection status of all entities that require power. Ensure all necessary entities are connected to the power network to avoid operational disruptions.\n\n### Inserter Power Issues\n- Ensure that inserters are connected to the power network to prevent them from being inactive due to lack of electricity."}
