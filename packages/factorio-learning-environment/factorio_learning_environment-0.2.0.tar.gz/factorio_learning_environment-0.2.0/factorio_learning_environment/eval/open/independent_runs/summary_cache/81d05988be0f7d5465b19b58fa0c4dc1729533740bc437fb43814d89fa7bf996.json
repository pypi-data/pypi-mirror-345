{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(0.5, 0.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position 0.5, 0.5), boiler (position 0.5, 6.0) and requires connection via pipes to function properly. Currently, it is not connected to a power network and lacks input liquid.\n\n### Copper plate factory at position(-5.0, -65.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position -5.0, -65.0) which is currently full and not processing due to full output.\n- Burner mining drill (position 47.0, -82.0) extracting resources from the surrounding area.\n\n### Wooden chests\nMultiple wooden chests are located at various positions:\n- Chest at position (46.5, -83.5)\n- Chest at position (48.5, -83.5)\n- Chest at position (5.5, -79.5)\n- Chest at position (10.5, -79.5)\n- Chest at position (-4.5, -63.5)\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(2.5, -73.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 47.0, -82.0) and a stone furnace (position -5.0, -65.0) for processing iron ore.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to missing pipes\n- Ensure you have pipes in your inventory before attempting to connect the Boiler to the Steam Engine.\n\n### Errors when placing Offshore Pump\n- Ensure the Offshore Pump is in your inventory before attempting to place it.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors with furnace full output\n- Monitor the furnace inventory to avoid reaching full capacity which prevents further processing."}
