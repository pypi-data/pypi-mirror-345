Check for any entities that may obstruct the connection.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity in a tile before attempting to place it. Check the surrounding area for existing entities that may block placement.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items."}
