{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage at Position (x=4.0, y=-60.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=4.0, y=-60.0) with a drop position at (x=4.5, y=-58.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=4.5, y=-58.5) containing iron ore\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=5.5, y=-60.5) containing iron plates\n\n### Iron Plate Storage\nConsists of multiple wooden chests storing iron plates at the following positions:\n- Position (x=7.5, y=-60.5)\n- Position (x=6.5, y=-60.5)\n- Position (x=9.5, y=-60.5)\n- Position (x=8.5, y=-60.5)\n- Position (x=-4.5, y=-52.5)\n- Position (x=-5.5, y=-52.5)\n- Position (x=-3.5, y=-52.5)\n- Position (x=-2.5, y=-52.5)\n- Position (x=-14.5, y=-50.5)\n- Position (x=-13.5, y=-50.5)\n- Position (x=-12.5, y=-50.5)\n- Position (x=-11.5, y=-50.5)\n- Position (x=-10.5, y=-50.5)\n- Position (x=-9.5, y=-50.5)\n- Position (x=-8.5, y=-50.5)\n- Position (x=-7.5, y=-50.5)\n- Position (x=-6.5, y=-50.5)\n\n### Iron Ore and Iron Plate Storage\nConsists of iron chests storing iron ore and iron plates at the following positions:\n- Position (x=-6.5, y=-50.5)\n- Position (x=-5.5, y=-50.5)\n\n### Stone Furnaces\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-15.0, y=-48.0) with coal as fuel and iron ore as input\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-13.0, y=-48.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-11.0, y=-48.0) with coal as fuel and no ingredients to smelt\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Extracting from a Chest\n- Ensure that the chest is not full or blocked before attempting to extract items. The chest at position (x=4.5, y=-58.5) is full, preventing extraction.\n\n### Errors due to Lack of Fuel\n- Ensure that the burner mining drill at position (x=4.0, y=-60.0) is fueled to continue mining operations.\n\n### Errors with Full Output in Furnaces\n- Regularly empty the output of furnaces to prevent them from becoming full and halting production.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n- No utility functions or important variables were defined or invoked during these steps."}
