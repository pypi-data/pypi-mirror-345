{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n--------------------\nNo structures have been successfully constructed on the map during these steps. Multiple attempts to place a Lab at position (0.5, 2.5) did not complete due to crafting failures and inventory shortages. No other new structure entities have been added.\n\nERROR TIPS\n----------\n\u2022 API Call Consistency \u2013 When invoking get_entities, use the correct parameter style. Remove unsupported keyword arguments (such as \u201cradius\u201d) and ensure the number of positional arguments matches the function\u2019s definition.\n\u2022 None Handling \u2013 Always check that get_entities returns an iterable. If it returns None, use an empty list fallback before attempting to iterate.\n\u2022 Inventory Validation \u2013 Verify that a Lab is available in the inventory before attempting to place it on the map to prevent placement errors.\n\u2022 Prerequisite Resource Management \u2013 Confirm that all required sub-ingredients (for example, iron-gear-wheel, electronic-circuit, copper-cable) are available or producible before initiating Lab crafting.\n\u2022 Production Chain Check \u2013 Ensure that resource conversion processes (such as smelting) reliably update material counts so that intermediate products meet the demands of complex crafting operations."}
