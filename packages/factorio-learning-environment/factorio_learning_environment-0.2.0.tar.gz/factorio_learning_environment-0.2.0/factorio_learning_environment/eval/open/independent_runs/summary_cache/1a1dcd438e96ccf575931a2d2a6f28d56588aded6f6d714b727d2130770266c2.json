{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Crude Oil Extraction and Processing at position (17.5, 40.5)\nConsists of a Pumpjack (position: x=17.5, y=40.5), Oil Refinery (position: x=23.5, y=43.5), Storage Tank (position: x=29.5, y=44.5), Chemical Plant (position: x=29.5, y=49.5), and associated pipes and power poles. The Oil Refinery and Chemical Plant are now connected to the power network.\n\n### Electricity Generation at position (-5.5, 2.0)\nConsists of a Boiler (position: x=-5.5, y=2.0), Steam Engine (position: x=-0.5, y=5.5), Offshore Pump (position: x=-9.5, y=-0.5), and associated pipes and power poles. The Boiler is now consistently fueled with coal.\n\n### Water Supply at position (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of an Offshore Pump (position: x=-9.5, y=-0.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n* Errors when using entities without power\n  - Ensure that entities requiring power are connected to a power network.\n* Errors when connecting entities without fluid in the source entity\n  - Ensure that the source entity has fluid in it before attempting to connect it to another entity that requires fluid input.\n* Errors when entities are not connected properly\n  - Ensure that entities are connected properly.\n* Errors when accessing list indices out of range\n  - Ensure that list indices are within the valid range before accessing them.\n* Errors when using undefined variables\n  - Ensure that all variables are defined before using them.\n* Errors when placing entities at occupied or unplaceable positions\n  - Ensure that the target location is clear and placeable before attempting to place an entity.\n\n### NAMESPACE\nNo utility functions have been defined by the agent. \n\nImportant variables that have been assigned:\n- `storage_tank`: StorageTank entity\n- `chemical_plant`: ChemicalPlant entity\n- `oil_refinery`: OilRefinery entity\n- `boiler`: Boiler entity\n- `steam_engine`: SteamEngine entity\n- `offshore_pump`: OffshorePump entity\n- `pumpjack`: Pumpjack entity\n- `pipes`: list of Pipe entities\n- `power_poles`: list of SmallElectricPole entities\n\nThese variables are used to interact with the respective entities on the map."}
