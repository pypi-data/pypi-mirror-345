</h4>


``metatomic`` is a library that defines a common interface between atomistic
machine learning models, and atomistic simulation engines. Our main goal is to
define and train models once, and then be able to re-use them across many
different simulation engines (such as LAMMPS, GROMACS, *etc.*). We strive to
achieve this goal without imposing any structure on the model itself, and to
allow any model architecture to be used.
