{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace (position 0.0, 0.0)\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position (42.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position 42.0, -83.0)\n\n### Wooden Chest at position (42.5, -81.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest (position 42.5, -81.5)\n\n### Burner Inserters\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Inserter (position 42.5, -80.5)\n- Burner Inserter (position 43.5, -81.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n- **Errors when using burner mining drill with no fuel**: Ensure that the burner mining drill has sufficient fuel before it is expected to operate. Check the inventory of the drill and refill it as necessary.\n- **Errors when inserters are waiting for source items**: Make sure there are items in the source (e.g., wooden chest) that the inserter is trying to pull from. If the source is empty, the inserter will remain in a waiting state.\n- **Errors when inserters are waiting for space in destination**: Ensure that the destination (e.g., furnace) has space available for the items being inserted. If the destination is full, the inserter will not be able to place items.\n- **Repeated errors with the stone furnace**: The stone furnace often reports 'NO_INGREDIENTS'. Ensure that the furnace has the necessary ingredients to operate, such as iron ore.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- **Functions Defined**: None reported.\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `iron_ore`: int\n  - `coal`: int\n  - `wood`: int\n  - `burner_mining_drill_status`: str\n  - `stone_furnace_status`: str\n  - `wooden_chest_inventory`: dict"}
