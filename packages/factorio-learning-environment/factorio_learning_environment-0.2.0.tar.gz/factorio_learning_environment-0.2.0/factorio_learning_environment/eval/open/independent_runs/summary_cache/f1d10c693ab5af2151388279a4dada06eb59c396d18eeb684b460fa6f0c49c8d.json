{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper plate factory at position(4.0, -63.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position (4.0, -63.0)) with a fuel inventory containing coal and an output of copper plates.\n- An inserter that moves items from the furnace to the inventory (not explicitly listed but implied by the operation).\n\n### Lab at position(x)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab (position (x, y)) which is currently not powered, requiring connections to an electricity source.\n\n### Electricity group at position(x)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Small electric pole (position (2.5, 1.5))\n- Small electric pole (position (2.5, 0.5))\n- Small electric pole (position (2.5, 2.5))\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when extracting items from a furnace\n- Ensure that the furnace is not full and contains the item you want to extract before attempting to extract items. In this case, the error occurred because there was no valid entity containing iron-plate at the specified position.\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities by position\n- Verify that the entity you are trying to access exists at the specified position. The error occurred because there was no steam engine found at the assumed position (1.5, 0.5). Check the map for the correct position of the steam engine before trying to access it.\n\n### Errors related to power supply\n- Ensure that all necessary connections are made to power the lab and other electrical entities. The lab is currently not powered, which may hinder its functionality."}
