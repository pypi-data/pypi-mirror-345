{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-13.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0), extracting iron ore.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-13.0, -48.0), smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-11.0, -48.0), smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-9.0, -48.0), smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Iron Chests** at positions (-16.5, -48.5), (-15.5, -48.5), (-14.5, -48.5), (-13.5, -49.5), and (-14.5, -47.5), used for storing iron ore and iron plates.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-14.5, -48.5) and (-12.5, -49.5), used for temporary storage of iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserters** and **Iron Chests** facilitating the transfer of materials between entities.\n\n### Coal Storage Facility at Position (47.5, -80.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Iron Chests** at positions (41.5, -80.5), (42.5, -80.5), (44.5, -80.5), (45.5, -80.5), (47.5, -80.5), and (49.5, -80.5), used for storing coal.\n- **Burner Inserters** at positions (41.5, -78.5) and (43.5, -80.5), facilitating the movement of coal between chests.\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (41.0, -82.0), extracting coal.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (43.0, -82.0), potentially used for smelting operations.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (41.5, -79.5), used for temporary storage of coal.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the supply chain connected to the inserter is complete and that there are source items available for the inserter to pick up.\n\n### Errors with Refueling or Clearing Drop Chest\n- Verify that the target chest contains the expected items before attempting to extract or refuel. Ensure that the chest is not full and has the correct items for the operation.\n\n### Errors with Chest at Drop Position Being Full\n- Regularly check and clear chests at drop positions to prevent mining drills from halting operations due to full chests."}
