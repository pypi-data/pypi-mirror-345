{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Smelting Array at (0,0)\nConsists of four furnaces arranged in a grid:\n- Stone furnace at (0.0, 0.0)\n- Stone furnace at (2.0, 0.0) \n- Stone furnace at (2.0, 4.0)\n- Stone furnace at (4.0, 4.0)\nAll furnaces are currently idle with no ingredients\n\n### Automated Iron Mining & Smelting at (-18.0, -53.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-18.0, -53.0) mining iron ore\n- Stone furnace at (-17.0, -51.0) for direct smelting\nCurrently drill is working but blocked due to full output, furnace is working and contains iron plates\n\n### Automated Copper Mining & Smelting at (-21.0, -73.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-21.0, -73.0) mining copper ore\n- Stone furnace at (-20.0, -71.0) for direct smelting\nCurrently drill is working but blocked due to full output, furnace is working and producing copper plates\n\n### Research Lab Setup at (10.5, 0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Lab loaded with automation science packs\nCurrently not functioning due to lack of power\n\n### Incomplete Power Generation System\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Boiler at (-14.5, 19.0) with coal fuel\n- Steam engine at (-8.5, 19.5)\nSystem is not operational due to missing pipe connections between components\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Issues\n- When placing a furnace or other entity, ensure you have the required item in inventory first\n- Verify all required components are available before starting construction of complex systems\n\n### Resource Management Issues\n- Check inventory for required fuel (coal) before attempting to insert it into entities\n- Monitor furnace and drill outputs to prevent blockages:\n  - Drills are showing \"waiting for space in destination\" warnings\n  - Need to regularly extract products from furnaces to maintain production flow\n\n### Extraction Issues\n- Verify target entity exists and contains the desired item before attempting extraction\n- Ensure correct entity coordinates when attempting to extract items\n- When extracting from furnaces, confirm they have completed smelting and contain the desired output\n\n### Crafting Issues\n- Ensure all required raw materials are available before attempting to craft items\n- For items requiring machine assembly, build appropriate assembly machines first\n- Check if item requires furnace smelting before attempting manual crafting\n\n### Power System Setup Issues\n- Ensure all components (pump, boiler, steam engine) are properly connected with pipes\n- Have necessary pipes crafted before attempting to connect fluid-based systems\n- Connect power poles to create electrical network for powered entities\n\n### Resource Collection Workflow\n- Maintain adequate coal supplies for fueling multiple entities\n- Keep track of furnace contents to optimize extraction timing\n- Gather necessary raw resources (like wood) before attempting to craft items requiring them"}
