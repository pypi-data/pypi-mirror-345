It currently has 6 coal inside but is not smelting anything due to missing iron ore.\n\n### Iron Ore Mine at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of a burner mining drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) and a wooden chest at position (-14.5, -48.5). The drill has 9 coal and is actively mining iron ore, placing it into the adjacent chest. The chest currently contains iron ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when crafting items due to missing raw resources\n- Some items like `stone` and `wood` are raw resources that must be harvested, not crafted. Ensure you harvest these resources before attempting to craft items that require them.\n\n### Errors when crafting items due to missing intermediate crafted resources\n- When crafting complex items like `burner-mining-drill`, ensure you have all the required sub-ingredients like `iron-gear-wheel` and `stone-furnace`. If these sub-ingredients also require crafting, make sure you have the necessary resources and crafting machines available.\n\n### Errors when placing entities due to obstruction\n- Before placing an entity, ensure that the target location is not obstructed by other entities or unplaceable terrain like water.\n\n### Errors when placing entities due to distance\n- When placing an entity, ensure that you are within the maximum placement distance from the target location. Move closer to the target location if necessary.\n\n### Errors when placing entities due to missing items\n- When placing an entity, ensure that you have the entity in your inventory\n\n### Errors when placing an entity on a tile already occupied\n- Before placing an entity, ensure that the target location is not already occupied by another entity. Consider picking up the existing entity before placing a new one.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions:\n- `craft_item(item_prototype: Prototype)`:\n    - Failure: Occurs when a required sub-ingredient is missing or cannot be crafted. This can happen if the recipe for the sub-ingredient doesn't exist (raw resource) or if the necessary crafting machine is not available.\n    - Success: Creates the specified item and adds it to the inventory.\n- `place_entity(entity_prototype: Prototype, position: Position)`:\n    - Failure: Occurs when the target location is obstructed, unplaceable, or too far away. Also occurs if the entity is not in the inventory, or if another entity is already present at the location.\n    - Success: Places the specified entity at the given position on the map.\n\n### Important Variables:\n- `Prototype`: Used to specify the type of item or entity to craft or place.\n- `Position`: Used to specify the location to place an entity.\n```"}
