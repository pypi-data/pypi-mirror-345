{"content": "# FACTORIO AGENT REPORT\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System at position (-9.5, 1.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump (position x=-9.5, y=1.5)\n- Boiler (position x=-5.0, y=4.5)\n- Steam engine (position x=0.5, y=8.5)\n- Pipe network connecting these components\n- Small electric poles distributing power\n\nThis structure generates electricity by pumping water from a nearby water source, heating it in the boiler to produce steam, which then powers the steam engine.\n\n### Coal Mining Operation at position (16.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (position x=16.0, y=0.0)\n- Collection chest (position x=16.5, y=1.5)\n- Burner inserter (position x=17.5, y=1.5)\n- Transport belt (position x=18.5, y=1.5)\n\nThis structure mines coal from a coal patch. The burner mining drill extracts coal and places it into the collection chest. The burner inserter takes coal from the chest but currently has no valid output destination.\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Line at position (15.5, 70.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill (position x=15.5, y=70.5)\n- Iron ore collection chest (position x=15.5, y=72.5)\n- Stone furnace (position x=16.0, y=74.0)\n- Burner inserter (position x=14.5, y=73.5) to move items from storage to furnace\n- Inserter (position x=17.5, y=73.5) to move iron plates to assembling machine\n- Assembling machine (position x=19.5, y=73.5) set to craft iron gear wheels\n- Inserter (position x=21.5, y=73.5) to move gear wheels to output chest\n- Output chest (position x=22.5, y=73.5)\n- Coal storage chest (position x=13.5, y=73.5)\n- Small electric poles connecting the electrical components\n\nThis structure mines iron ore, smelts it into iron plates, and then assembles the plates into iron gear wheels. The electric mining drill extracts iron ore and places it into a collection chest. The ore should then be moved to the furnace for smelting, with the resulting iron plates being fed into the assembling machine to create iron gear wheels, which are then stored in the output chest.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied spaces\n- Before placing an entity, check if the target position is already occupied by another entity\n- Consider using different coordinates or adjusting the placement position if you encounter collision errors\n- When placing inserters between entities, ensure there is enough space between the source and destination entities\n\n### Errors when connecting entities with transport belts\n- Transport belts cannot connect directly to chests; use an inserter as an intermediary\n- When connecting distant entities with belts, ensure the path is valid and not too far apart\n- For long distances, consider using underground belts or planning a proper belt path\n\n### Errors when extracting items that don't exist\n- Verify that the target container actually contains the items you're trying to extract\n- Wait for production processes to complete before attempting to extract their outputs\n- Use status checks to confirm that entities are working and producing items\n\n### Errors with inserter placement and orientation\n- When placing inserters, ensure they are correctly oriented to pick up from the source and drop at the destination\n- Consider the pickup and drop positions of inserters when designing factory layouts\n- Leave enough space between entities for inserters to function properly\n\n### Errors with power connections\n- Ensure all electrical entities are connected to the power network via electric poles\n- Check that power-generating equipment (like steam engines) is properly set up and fueled\n- Monitor power production and consumption to avoid shortages"}
