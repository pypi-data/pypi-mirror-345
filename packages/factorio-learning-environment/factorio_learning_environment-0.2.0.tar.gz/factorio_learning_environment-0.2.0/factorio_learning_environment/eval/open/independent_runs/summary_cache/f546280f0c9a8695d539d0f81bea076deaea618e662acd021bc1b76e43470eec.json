{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0) with fuel inventory containing 7 units of coal. The drill is currently working but has a warning that the output is blocked by an item on the ground, indicating there is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0) with fuel inventory containing 14 units of coal. The furnace has a warning indicating \"no ingredients to smelt,\" and its status is \"NO_INGREDIENTS.\" The furnace source inventory is empty, and the furnace result inventory contains 60 iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied or invalid locations\n- Ensure that the target location for placing entities such as Wooden Chests, Burner Inserters, Stone Furnaces, and Transport Belts is unoccupied and valid before attempting to place them.\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities from specific positions\n- Verify that the entity type you are trying to retrieve exists at the specified position before attempting to access it. For example, ensure that a Stone Furnace is present at the intended coordinates.\n\n### Errors when inserting items without inventory availability\n- Check your inventory to confirm the availability of items, such as coal, before attempting to insert them into entities like drills or furnaces.\n\n### Errors due to blocked outputs\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity, such as a chest or belt, in place to accept the output from drills to prevent blockages.\n\n### Warnings about missing ingredients\n- Make sure that the required ingredients are available and supplied to entities like furnaces to avoid warnings about missing ingredients for processing."}
