{"content": "Here is the updated report:\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone processing setup at position(x=-50.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (position x=-50.0, y=0.0)\n- Stone furnace (position x=-54.0, y=0.0)\n- Wooden chest (position x=-51.5, y=0.5)\n- Burner inserter (position x=-51.5, y=-0.5)\n\n### New mining setup at position(x=-46.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (position x=-46.0, y=0.0) - output blocked\n- Stone furnace (position x=-43.0, y=0.0)\n- Burner inserter (position x=-44.5, y=-0.5)\n\n### Production facility at position(x=20.0, y=20.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace (position x=23.0, y=20.0) - no ingredients\n- Burner inserter (position x=21.5, y=20.5)\n- Assembling machine 2 (position x=26.5, y=20.5) - no power\n- Output chest (position x=28.5, y=20.5)\n- Small electric pole network (positions x=24.5,y=18.5 to x=26.5,y=18.5)\n\n### Power plant attempts\n1. Partial setup at x=0.0,y=20.5:\n   - Boiler (position x=0.0, y=20.5) - not connected\n   - Failed steam engine placement at x=0.0,y=22.0\n\n### Offshore pumps\n- At x=-20.5,y=-3.5 (not connected)\n- At x=-9.5,y=-0.5 (connected to pipe network)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Power plant placement issues (continued)\n- Steam engine placement failures due to:\n  - Blocking objects (x=0.0,y=22.0; x=60.0,y=62.0)\n  - Distance too far (x=60.0,y=62.0 when player at 0,0)\n- Solution: \n  - Move closer before placement attempts\n  - Clear target area completely before building\n  - Verify placement positions are water-free\n\n### Fluid connection problems (continued)\n- Failed to connect offshore pump at x=-9.5,y=-0.5 to boiler at x=0.0,y=20.5\n- Solution:\n  - Build closer water sources\n  - Use intermediate pipe connections\n  - Verify pipe routing paths are clear\n\n### Entity interaction issues (continued)\n- Multiple failed entity lookups (burner mining drill at x=-46.0,y=21.0, chest at x=-45.5,y=1.5)\n- Solution:\n  - Verify entity existence before interaction\n  - Track entity positions more carefully\n  - Handle missing entities gracefully\n\n### Power system issues (new)\n- Assembling machine shows NO_POWER despite being connected to poles\n- Solution:\n  - Verify power production is actually working\n  - Check pole connections are valid\n  - Ensure power network has sufficient generation\n\n### General recommendations\n1. Focus on completing one functional power plant\n2. Verify entity positions before interaction\n3. Clear areas completely before building\n4. Build power systems closer to water sources\n5. Check power network connections thoroughly"}
