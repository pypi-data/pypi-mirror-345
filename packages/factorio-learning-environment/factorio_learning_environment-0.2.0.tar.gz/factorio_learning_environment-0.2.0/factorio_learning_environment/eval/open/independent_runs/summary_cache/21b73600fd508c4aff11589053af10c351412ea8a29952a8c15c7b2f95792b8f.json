{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Plate Smelting Setup at position(x=52.0, y=-79.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position(x=52.0, y=-79.0)\n- **Burner Inserter** at position(x=53.5, y=-79.5) (out of fuel)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position(x=54.5, y=-79.5) (contains iron plates)\n- **Burner Inserter** at position(x=55.5, y=-78.5) (out of fuel)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position(x=56.5, y=-78.5)\n\n#### Iron Ore Mining Setup at position(x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position(x=-15.0, y=-50.0) (out of fuel)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position(x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n- **Burner Inserter** at position(x=-13.5, y=-48.5) (waiting for source items)\n- **Burner Inserter** at position(x=-12.5, y=-48.5) (waiting for source items)\n\n#### Storage Area at position(x=0.5, y=0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Wooden Chest** at position(x=0.5, y=0.5) (contains various items)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position(x=1.5, y=0.5) (contains various items)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position(x=2.5, y=0.5) (contains coal)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position(x=3.5, y=0.5) (contains coal)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position(x=4.5, y=0.5) (contains coal and iron ore)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position(x=5.5, y=0.5) (contains iron ore, plates, and gear wheels)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Mining Drill Not Working\n- **Error**: The mining drill at position(x=-15.0, y=-50.0) is not working due to lack of fuel and a full chest at the drop position.\n- **Tip**: Ensure the mining drill has sufficient fuel and that the chest at the drop position is not full. Empty the chest or redirect the output to another storage.\n\n#### Burner Inserters Out of Fuel\n- **Error**: Burner inserters at positions(x=53.5, y=-79.5) and (x=55.5, y=-78.5) are out of fuel.\n- **Tip**: Provide coal or other fuel sources to the burner inserters to keep them operational.\n\n#### Furnace Has No Ingredients\n- **Error**: The stone furnace at position(x=52.0, y=-79.0) has no ingredients to smelt.\n- **Tip**: Ensure that the furnace is supplied with iron ore and fuel (coal) to start the smelting process.\n\n#### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- **Error**: Burner inserters at positions(x=42.5, y=-80.5) and (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) are waiting for source items.\n- **Tip**: Ensure that the source chests have items to be picked up by the inserters. If the chests are empty, supply them with the necessary items.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n#### Utility Functions\n- **None defined yet**\n\n#### Important Variables\n- **None assigned yet**"}
