Check the positions and orientations of pipes to ensure they form a continuous path between the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine.\n\n### Errors when Connecting to Electricity Network\n- Verify that all entities requiring power are connected to the electricity network and that the network itself is properly set up with no breaks in the connection. Ensure that all small electric poles are correctly placed and connected to form a continuous network.\n\n### Errors with Steam Engine Warnings\n- Address warnings related to the steam engine such as \"not connected to power network\" and \"no input liquid\". Ensure that the steam engine is properly connected to both the power network and the fluid system providing steam."}
