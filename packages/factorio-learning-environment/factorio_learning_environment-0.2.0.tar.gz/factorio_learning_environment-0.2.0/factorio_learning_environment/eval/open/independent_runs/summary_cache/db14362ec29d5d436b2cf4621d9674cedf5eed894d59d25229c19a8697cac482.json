{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position x=-15.0, y=-50.0\n- **Furnace 1** at position x=-12.0, y=-48.0\n- **Furnace 2** at position x=-10.0, y=-48.0\n- **Burner Inserter** at position x=-14.5, y=-47.5\n- **Inserter** at position x=-11.5, y=-45.5\n- **Destination Chest** at position x=-14.5, y=-46.5\n- **Storage Chest** at position x=-6.5, y=-48.5\n\nThis facility is responsible for mining iron ore, transferring it to furnaces for smelting into iron plates, and storing the produced iron plates in a storage chest.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items into entities\n- Ensure that the target entity has enough capacity to accept the items being inserted. This will prevent exceptions such as \"Could not insert: LuaItemStack\".\n\n### Errors when extracting items with insufficient quantity\n- Verify that the source entity contains the required quantity of items before attempting to extract. This will avoid errors like \"Could not extract iron-ore from wooden-chest: must be greater than 0\".\n\n### Inserter waiting for source items\n- Ensure that the source entity connected to the inserter has items available for transfer to prevent the inserter from idling."}
