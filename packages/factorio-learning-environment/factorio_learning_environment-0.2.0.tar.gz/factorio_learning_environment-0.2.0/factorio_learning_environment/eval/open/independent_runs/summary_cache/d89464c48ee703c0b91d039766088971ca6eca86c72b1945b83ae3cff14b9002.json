{"content": "Based on the execution logs and entity data, I'll provide a structured report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System\nLocated around (-4.5, 14.5) to (-9.5, 24.5), consists of:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Water pipe system connecting offshore pump to boiler\n- Boiler at (-2.5, 24.0)\n- Steam engine at (-4.5, 14.5)\n- Steam pipe system attempting to connect boiler to steam engine\n- Wooden chest for fuel storage at (-4.5, 25.5)\n\n### Automation Factory\nLocated around (23.5, 2.5), consists of:\n- Assembling machine 1 at (23.5, 2.5) configured to create inserters\n- Input wooden chest at (20.5, 2.5) containing 36 inserters\n- Output wooden chest at (26.5, 2.5)\n- Two burner inserters at (21.5, 2.5) and (25.5, 2.5) for material movement\n- Small electric pole for power\n\n### Science Pack Production\nLocated around (32.5, 5.5), consists of:\n- Assembling machine 1 at (32.5, 5.5) configured to create logistic science packs\n- Small electric pole at (30.5, 7.5)\n\n### Smelting Area\nMultiple furnaces for metal processing:\n- Stone furnace at (0.0, 0.0)\n- Stone furnace at (2.0, 0.0) with coal fuel and iron plate output\n- Stone furnace at (4.0, 4.0) with full coal fuel\n- Stone furnace at (6.0, 4.0)\n\n### Research Area\nMultiple labs distributed across the map, currently unpowered but containing:\n- Lab with 1 automation pack and 4 logistic packs\n- Lab with 2 automation packs and 2 logistic packs\n- Lab with 40 logistic packs\n- Several empty labs\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Pipe Placement Errors\n- Ensure target location is clear of other entities before placing pipes\n- Check for entity collisions at positions like (-2.5, 15.5) and (-2.0, 14.5)\n- When placing underground pipes, verify both entrance and exit positions are free\n\n### Power System Issues\n- Steam engine not receiving fluid due to disconnected pipe system\n- Ensure continuous pipe connections between boiler steam output and steam engine input\n- Keep sufficient coal supply in boiler to maintain power generation\n\n### Production Issues\n- Assembling machines lacking power due to incomplete electrical network\n- Ensure resources are available before starting production (iron plates, gear wheels, electronic circuits)\n- Verify recipe requirements are met before attempting production\n\n### Resource Management\n- Maintain coal supply for power generation and burner devices\n- Monitor fuel levels in burner inserters and furnaces\n- Keep track of raw material supply for production chains"}
