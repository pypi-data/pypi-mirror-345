For example, you need sufficient iron plates to craft a stone furnace.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into furnaces\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before trying to insert them into the furnace. For instance, you cannot insert coal or iron ore if you do not have them in your inventory.\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure that the position where you are trying to place a new entity is not occupied by another entity. \n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items. \n\n### Errors when inserting into a furnace without fuel\n- Check that the furnace has fuel before trying to insert items for smelting. If the furnace is out of fuel, it will not operate."}
