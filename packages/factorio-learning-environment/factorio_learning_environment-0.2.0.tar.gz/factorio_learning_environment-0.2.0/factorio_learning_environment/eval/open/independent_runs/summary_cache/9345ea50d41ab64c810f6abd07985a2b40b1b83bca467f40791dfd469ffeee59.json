{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=4.0, y=-60.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=4.5, y=-58.5) for iron ore collection.\n- Multiple Wooden Chests at positions (x=5.5, y=-60.5), (x=7.5, y=-60.5), (x=6.5, y=-60.5), (x=9.5, y=-60.5), (x=8.5, y=-60.5) for storage purposes.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chests at positions (x=-14.5, y=-50.5), (x=-13.5, y=-50.5), (x=-12.5, y=-50.5), (x=-11.5, y=-50.5), (x=-10.5, y=-50.5), (x=-9.5, y=-50.5), (x=-8.5, y=-50.5), (x=-7.5, y=-50.5), (x=-6.5, y=-50.5) for storing iron plates.\n- Iron Chest at position (x=-5.5, y=-50.5) for storing iron plates.\n\n### Iron Smelting Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-15.0, y=-48.0) with coal as fuel, producing iron plates.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-13.0, y=-48.0) with coal as fuel, producing iron plates.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-11.0, y=-48.0) with coal as fuel, producing iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Lack of Fuel\n- Ensure sufficient coal is available in the inventory to refuel the burner mining drill to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Errors when Inserting Items\n- Verify that the inventory contains the items you intend to insert into a chest or machine to avoid insertion errors.\n\n### Errors due to Full Chests\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are full to prevent disruptions in the mining and production processes.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `insert_item`: Used to insert items into chests. Ensure the source inventory has the items intended for insertion to avoid exceptions.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `iron_chest`: Represents the iron chest used for storing iron plates.\n- `extracted_iron_plates`: Represents the quantity of iron plates extracted from furnaces or chests."}
