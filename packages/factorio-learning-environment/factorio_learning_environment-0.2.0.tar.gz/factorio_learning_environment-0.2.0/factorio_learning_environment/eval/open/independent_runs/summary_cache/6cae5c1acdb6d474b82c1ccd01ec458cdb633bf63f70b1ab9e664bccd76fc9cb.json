{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) extracting iron ore. The drill is connected to:\n  - **Iron Chest** at position (x=-16.5, y=-48.5) storing iron ore.\n  - **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) storing iron ore.\n  - **Iron Chest** at position (x=-15.5, y=-48.5) currently empty.\n- **Stone Furnaces** processing iron ore into iron plates:\n  - Furnace at position (x=-13.0, y=-48.0) with no ingredients currently.\n  - Furnace at position (x=-11.0, y=-48.0) producing iron plates.\n  - Furnace at position (x=-9.0, y=-48.0) producing iron plates.\n- **Iron Chests** for storing processed materials:\n  - Iron Chest at position (x=-13.5, y=-49.5) currently empty.\n  - Iron Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5) currently empty.\n- **Wooden Chests** for additional storage:\n  - Wooden Chest at position (x=-12.5, y=-49.5) currently empty.\n  - Wooden Chest at position (x=-9.5, y=-49.5) currently empty.\n\n### Coal Storage and Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Iron Chests** for storing coal:\n  - Iron Chest at position (x=47.5, y=-80.5) with coal and iron plates.\n  - Iron Chest at position (x=49.5, y=-80.5) with coal.\n- **Burner Inserters** for transferring coal:\n  - Burner Inserter at position (x=43.5, y=-80.5) transferring items between chests and furnaces.\n  - Burner Inserter at position (x=41.5, y=-78.5) waiting for source items.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Iron Chests** storing iron plates:\n  - Iron Chest at position (x=42.5, y=-80.5) with iron plates.\n  - Iron Chest at position (x=44.5, y=-80.5) with coal and iron plates.\n  - Iron Chest at position (x=45.5, y=-80.5) with coal and iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when extracting items from furnaces\n- Ensure that the furnaces are not full and have space to output items before attempting to extract.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placement.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient resources in connected chests\n- Regularly check and replenish resources in connected chests to ensure continuous operation of inserters and drills."}
