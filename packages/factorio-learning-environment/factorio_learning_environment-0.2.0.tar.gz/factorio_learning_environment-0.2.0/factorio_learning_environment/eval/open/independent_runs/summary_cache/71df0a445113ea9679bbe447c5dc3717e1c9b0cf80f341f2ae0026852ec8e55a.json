{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Setup at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) storing iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -48.5) transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Alignment\n- Ensure that the inserter's pickup position is correctly aligned with the chest. The pickup position should match the chest's position to avoid misalignment errors.\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities\n- Before placing an entity, verify that the target tile is not occupied by another entity and is suitable for placement. Consider adjusting spacing, direction, or reference position to avoid collisions with nearby entities.\n\n### Errors Due to Insufficient Resources\n- Always check your inventory for sufficient resources before attempting to insert items into entities. Ensure you have enough coal or other necessary resources to fuel your machines.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Ingredients\n- Regularly inspect the inserter setup to ensure that the furnace is receiving the necessary ingredients. Misalignment or incorrect setup can prevent the transfer of materials to the furnace."}
