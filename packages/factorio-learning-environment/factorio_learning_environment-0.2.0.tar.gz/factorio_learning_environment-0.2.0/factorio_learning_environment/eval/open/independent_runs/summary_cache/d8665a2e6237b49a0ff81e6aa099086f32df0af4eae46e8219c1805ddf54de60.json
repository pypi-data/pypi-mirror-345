{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\n- **Iron Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) for extracting iron ore.\n- **Iron Furnace** at position (x=41.0, y=-80.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Iron Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) intended to collect iron ore, though currently not functioning as expected.\n\n### Coal Mining Facility\n- **Coal Mining Drill** at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0) for extracting coal.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Processing Facility\n- **Copper Furnace** at position (x=-20.0, y=-71.0) for smelting copper ore into copper plates.\n- **Copper Chest** at position (x=-39.5, y=-71.5) intended to collect copper ore, though currently not functioning as expected.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors with Chest Positioning\n- **Iron Chest and Copper Chest Misalignment**: Both chests are not collecting ore as intended. Ensure that the chests are properly aligned with the output of mining drills or furnaces to collect resources efficiently.\n\n### Inventory Management Errors\n- **Coal Insertion Error**: Attempted to insert coal into the iron drill without having coal in inventory. Ensure that the required resources are available in the inventory before attempting to insert them into machines.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- **Utility Functions**\n  - `insert_item(item_type: Prototype, target_entity: Entity, quantity: int)`: Attempts to insert a specified quantity of an item into a target entity. \n    - **Failure Mode**: The function failed when there was no coal in the inventory to insert into the iron drill.\n  \n- **Important Variables**\n  - `iron_drill`: Represents the iron mining drill entity.\n  - `coal`: Represents coal resource in the inventory.\n  - `iron_chest`: Represents the iron chest entity intended for collecting iron ore.\n  - `copper_chest`: Represents the copper chest entity intended for collecting copper ore."}
