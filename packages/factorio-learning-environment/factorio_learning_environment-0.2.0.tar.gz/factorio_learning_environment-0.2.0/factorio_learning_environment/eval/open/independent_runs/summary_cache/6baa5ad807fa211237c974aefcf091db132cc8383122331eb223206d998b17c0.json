{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-10.5, 25.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (-1.5, 24.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting the Offshore Pump to the Boiler and Steam Engine, with various connection points including (-10.5, 24.5) and (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Small Electric Poles at various positions, including (-3.5, 22.5), to attempt connection to the power network\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at Position (-19.0, -73.0) with no ingredients to smelt, containing copper plates\n- Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0) with no ingredients to smelt, containing iron plates\n- Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) not receiving electricity, connected to a small electric pole and a wooden chest\n- Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5) and another at Position (6.5, -59.5) containing iron plates\n\n### Research Lab\n- Lab with input of automation science packs, located without power\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Pipe Connection\n- Ensure pipes are correctly aligned and unobstructed when connecting from the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine. Check for any placement blockages that may prevent successful connections.\n\n### Errors in Electricity Network\n- Verify that all small electric poles are properly connected and within range to supply power. Ensure there are no nil values or indexing errors in the connection process.\n\n### Errors in Fuel Insertion\n- Before attempting to insert fuel into entities like boilers, confirm that the required fuel type is available in your inventory.\n\n### Errors in Power Generation\n- After setting up the steam engine, ensure that all necessary connections are made and that there is a sufficient supply of input liquid to generate power. Check for any warnings or errors related to the lack of fluid or power network connection.\n\n### General Placement Errors\n- Always verify that the target tile is unoccupied before placing any entity to avoid placement blockages."}
