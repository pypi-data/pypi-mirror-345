{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES  \n\n#### Electricity Generator at position (x=-9.5, y=-0.5)  \n- **Offshore pump** at (x=-9.5, y=-0.5)  \n- **Boiler** at (x=-5.0, y=2.5)  \n- **Steam engine** at (x=0.5, y=6.5)  \n- **Small electric pole** at (x=3.5, y=6.5)  \n- Connected via pipes and power poles, but boiler is out of fuel and steam engine is not connected to power.  \n\n#### Oil Extraction and Processing Facility at position (x=17.5, y=40.5)  \n- **Pumpjack** at (x=17.5, y=40.5) (not receiving electricity)  \n- **Storage tank** at (x=22.5, y=44.5) (connected via pipes)  \n- **Oil refinery** at (x=29.5, y=48.5) (not receiving electricity, input/output pipes connected but no power)  \n- **Petroleum gas storage tank** at (x=35.5, y=49.5) (connected but empty)  \n- **Chemical plant** at (x=41.5, y=52.5) (not connected to power, missing coal and petroleum gas)  \n- **Wooden chest** at (x=39.5, y=52.5) (empty, intended for coal input)  \n\n### ERROR TIPS  \n\n#### Fluid Connection Issues  \n- **Refinery input/output not functional despite pipe connections**  \n  - Ensure power is supplied to the refinery (`oil-refinery` at x=29.5, y=48.5) and pumpjack (`pumpjack` at x=17.5, y=40.5).  \n  - Verify fluid flow direction: crude oil must reach refinery input (x=30.5, y=51.5).  \n\n#### Entity Placement Errors  \n- **Repeated inserter placement failure at (40.5, 52.5)**  \n  - Clear obstructing entities (e.g., pipes or poles) before placing inserters near the chemical plant.  \n- **Power pole placement too far (distance > 10 tiles)**  \n  - Move player closer to target (e.g., x=26.5, y=46.5) before placing poles.  \n\n#### Power Management  \n- **Critical entities (pumpjack, refinery) lack power**  \n  - Extend power grid using small electric poles to cover distant structures.  \n  - Prioritize connecting pumpjack (x=17.5, y=40.5) and refinery (x=29.5, y=48.5).  \n\n#### Chemical Plant Setup  \n- **Missing coal and petroleum gas for plastic production**  \n  - Place inserter to transfer coal from chest (x=39.5, y=52.5) to chemical plant.  \n  - Ensure petroleum gas is piped from refinery to chemical plant input (x=42.5, y=54.0).  \n\n#### Boiler Fuel  \n- **Boiler at (x=-5.0, y=2.5) is out of fuel**  \n  - Refuel manually or automate coal delivery with inserters.  \n\n#### Assertion Errors  \n- Replace `refinery.status == EntityStatus.WORKING` with checks for `NO_POWER` or `FULL_OUTPUT` to diagnose issues.  \n\n### NAMESPACE  \n*(No new functions defined by the agent in these steps.)*"}
