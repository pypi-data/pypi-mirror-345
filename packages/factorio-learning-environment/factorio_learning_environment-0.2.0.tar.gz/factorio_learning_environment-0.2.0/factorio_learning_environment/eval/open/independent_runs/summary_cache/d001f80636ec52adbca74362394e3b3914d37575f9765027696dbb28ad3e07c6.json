{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nNo structures have been successfully created on the map as of the current steps. The logs indicate attempts to place entities, but none have been successfully placed due to errors.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure the target tile is clear before attempting to place an entity. The logs indicate multiple attempts to place entities where the position was not clear, resulting in placement failures.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Verify that the intended placement position is not already occupied by another entity. This will prevent placement errors such as those seen with the Burner Inserter and Wooden Chest.\n\n### General placement errors\n- Double-check the coordinates before placing entities to ensure they are within valid and accessible areas. Several errors occurred due to attempts to place entities at invalid or obstructed coordinates."}
