{"content": "# FACTORY REPORT\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System at position (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump (position x=-9.5, y=-0.5)\n- Boiler (position x=-5.0, y=2.5)\n- Steam engine (position x=0.5, y=6.5)\n- Connected with pipes and small electric poles\n- Currently operational with coal as fuel\n\n### Iron Mining and Processing Complex at position (17.5, 72.5)\nConsists of:\n- 5 Electric mining drills positioned at:\n  - (x=17.5, y=72.5)\n  - (x=22.5, y=72.5)\n  - (x=27.5, y=72.5)\n  - (x=32.5, y=72.5)\n  - (x=37.5, y=72.5)\n- 5 Iron smelting furnaces positioned at:\n  - (x=20.0, y=76.0)\n  - (x=24.0, y=76.0)\n  - (x=29.0, y=76.0)\n  - (x=34.0, y=76.0)\n  - (x=39.0, y=76.0)\n- 5 Steel smelting furnaces positioned at:\n  - (x=21.0, y=81.0)\n  - (x=25.0, y=81.0)\n  - (x=30.0, y=81.0)\n  - (x=35.0, y=81.0)\n  - (x=40.0, y=81.0)\n- 15 Inserters for material movement:\n  - 5 inserters between mining drills and iron furnaces\n  - 5 inserters for feeding iron ore into iron furnaces\n  - 5 inserters for feeding iron plates into steel furnaces\n- Small electric poles connecting the system to the power grid\n- All furnaces have been fueled with coal\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with inserter placement and orientation\n- When placing inserters, ensure they are correctly oriented to pick up from the source and drop at the target\n- The inserters between miners and furnaces are currently not correctly aligned with the miners' drop positions\n- Ensure inserters are rotated in the correct direction to move materials in the intended flow\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Check if a tile is already occupied before attempting to place an entity there\n- Use the entity inspection to verify the position is free before placement\n- When placing transport belts, ensure the target position doesn't already have an inserter or other entity\n\n### Errors with connecting entities using transport belts\n- Transport belts cannot connect directly to furnaces - use inserters as intermediaries\n- When connecting entities with belts, ensure the path is clear and doesn't overlap with existing entities\n- For complex connections, plan the layout before placing entities to avoid conflicts\n\n### Errors with mining drill output handling\n- Mining drills need a clear drop position or a properly aligned inserter/belt to collect their output\n- Currently all mining drills are showing \"WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION\" status\n- Ensure the drop position of mining drills is properly connected to the next stage of production\n\n### Errors with material flow in the production chain\n- The production chain is currently stalled because materials aren't flowing properly\n- Inserters need to be correctly oriented to pick up from miners and drop into furnaces\n- Review the entire production flow to ensure materials can move from miners through iron furnaces to steel furnaces"}
