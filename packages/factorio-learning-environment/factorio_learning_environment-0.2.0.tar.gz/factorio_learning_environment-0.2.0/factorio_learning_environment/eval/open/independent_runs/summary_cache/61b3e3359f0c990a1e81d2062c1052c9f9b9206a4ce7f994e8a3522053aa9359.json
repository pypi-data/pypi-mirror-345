{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0): Extracts iron ore and delivers it to the adjacent wooden chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5): Stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5): Transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the stone furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates, but currently not receiving iron ore due to inserter misalignment.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Alignment Errors\n- Ensure that the inserter's pickup position is correctly aligned with the chest's position to facilitate the transfer of items. Misalignment causes the inserter to fail in picking up items.\n\n### Inserter Placement Errors\n- When placing an inserter, verify that there is no collision with existing entities and that the area is suitable for placement. Adjust spacing, direction, or reference position if necessary to avoid placement errors.\n\n### Fuel Management Errors\n- Maintain sufficient coal in your inventory to refuel mining drills and inserters. Running out of coal will halt operations and require manual intervention to resume.\n\n### Furnace Input Errors\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly positioned to drop iron ore into the furnace. Misalignment will prevent the furnace from receiving ingredients, leading to a lack of smelting activity."}
