{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (46.0, -82.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace at position (46.0, -82.0) that converts iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden chest at position (47.5, -81.5) that collects the produced iron plates.\nUpdates:\n- At step 38, 2 iron plates were extracted from the furnace.\n- At step 39, 10 additional coal were harvested and inserted into the furnace to continue smelting.\n- At step 40, the furnace fuel count was updated to 28 coal; 2 iron plates were produced and subsequently extracted.\n- The current furnace inventory now shows an updated fuel amount along with production parameters reflecting the recent operations.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to insufficient resource availability and incorrect inventory checks\n- Verify resource presence in the inventory before inserting into an entity. Always confirm the expected resource (e.g., coal, iron ore) is available to avoid failures.\n\n### Errors related to timing in processing cycles and smelting timeouts\n- Allow sufficient processing time for smelting operations to complete. In cases of timeout (e.g., additional iron plates not produced), adjust waiting periods or verify fuel and production settings to facilitate correct processing cycles.\n\n### Repeated mistakes with resource assertions\n- Check inventories and resource patches prior to operations to ensure that the required amounts are accessible, thereby preventing assertion failures."}
