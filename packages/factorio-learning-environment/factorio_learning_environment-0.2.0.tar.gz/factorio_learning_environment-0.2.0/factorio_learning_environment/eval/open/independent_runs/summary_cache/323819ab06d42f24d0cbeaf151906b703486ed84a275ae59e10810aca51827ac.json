{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n-------------------\nNo permanent new structures have been successfully placed on the map. The agent made several attempts to supply a Lab at position (0.5, 2.5) for Automation Science Packs research but never completed its placement due to inventory and crafting-chain issues. Although operations made use of existing smelting furnaces (an iron furnace at Position(x=5.0, y=5.0) and a copper furnace at Position(x=-27.0, y=-60.0)) for resource production, no new structure was constructed by the agent.\n\nERROR TIPS\n----------\n\u2022 API Parameter Errors \u2013 When calling get_entities, use the correct signature. Avoid passing unexpected keywords (such as \u2018radius\u2019) or extra positional arguments. Also, check that the returned value is iterable before using it.\n\u2022 Placement Failures \u2013 Verify that the required item (e.g. Lab) is present in inventory prior to attempting placement. Ensure the target tile is correctly validated for placement.\n\u2022 Crafting Chain Shortfalls \u2013 Before attempting to craft complex items like the Lab, confirm that all sub-ingredients (iron-gear-wheel, electronic-circuit, copper-cable, etc.) are producible with available machines or processes. This avoids failures from missing or uncraftable dependencies.\n\u2022 None Handling \u2013 Ensure that functions expected to return collections (such as get_entities) do not yield None. If they do, fall back to an empty list rather than iterating directly."}
