{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Plate Production Facility at position (x=2.0, y=-63.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner mining drill** at position (x=2.0, y=-63.0) extracting iron ore.\n- **Stone furnace** at position (x=4.0, y=-63.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner inserter** at position (x=3.5, y=-61.5) transferring items between the drill, furnace, and chests.\n- **Wooden chest** at position (x=2.5, y=-61.5) storing iron ore temporarily.\n- **Wooden chest** at position (x=4.5, y=-61.5) storing iron plates.\n\n#### Additional Stone Furnace at position (x=6.0, y=-63.0)\n- **Stone furnace** at position (x=6.0, y=-63.0) currently idle due to lack of ingredients.\n\n---\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when extracting items from an empty furnace\n- Ensure the furnace has produced the required items before attempting to extract them. Check the furnace's inventory status before extraction.\n\n#### Errors when placing items into a full chest\n- Verify the chest's inventory capacity before attempting to insert items. Use multiple chests or expand storage if necessary.\n\n#### Errors when inserting items into a furnace without fuel\n- Always ensure the furnace has sufficient fuel (e.g., coal) before adding ingredients for smelting.\n\n#### Errors when inserter is waiting for source items\n- Ensure the inserter has access to the required items (e.g., iron ore) and that the source entity (e.g., mining drill) is operational.\n\n#### Errors when furnace has no ingredients to smelt\n- Regularly check and supply the furnace with the necessary raw materials (e.g., iron ore) to avoid idle time."}
