{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) fueled with coal, extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (x=-15.5, y=-48.5) and (x=-14.5, y=-48.5), used for storing iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5), transferring iron ore from the chest to the stone furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0), converting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-46.5), storing produced iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5), transferring items between chests and the furnace.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extract_item with incorrect parameters\n- Ensure the correct parameters are used when calling functions. For example, the `extract_item` function does not accept a `position` keyword argument. Double-check the function signature before using it to avoid `TypeError`."}
