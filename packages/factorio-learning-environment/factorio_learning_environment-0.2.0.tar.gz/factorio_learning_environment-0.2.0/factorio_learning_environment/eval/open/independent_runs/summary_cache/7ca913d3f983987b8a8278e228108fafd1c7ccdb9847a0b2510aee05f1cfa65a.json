{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-20.0, -70.0) to (-18.0, -70.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -70.0) with iron ore input and iron plate output.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-18.0, -70.0) with iron ore input and iron plate output.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-19.0, -65.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -65.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-21.0, -62.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-21.0, -62.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining Facility at Position (-23.0, -68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) connected to a transport belt network.\n- Transport Belt network from position (-25.5, -70.5) to (-21.5, -66.5).\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Facility at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) connected to a transport belt network.\n- Transport Belt network from position (-15.5, -54.5) to (-12.5, -51.5).\n\n### Storage and Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (-16.5, -64.5) storing iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-20.5, -63.5) empty.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-12.5, -54.5) storing iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5) storing coal, iron ore, and iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (3.5, 0.5) empty.\n\n### Belt Groups\n- Multiple belt groups connecting various mining drills, furnaces, and chests, facilitating the transport of resources across the map.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Transport Belt Connectivity\n- Ensure that transport belts are properly connected to facilitate the movement of resources. Verify connections between belts to prevent resource blockages.\n\n### Errors with Furnaces Full Output\n- Regularly check furnaces to ensure they are not full. Extract processed materials to avoid production halts.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Monitor inserters to ensure they are supplied with source items. Adjust the supply chain to maintain a steady flow of resources to inserters.\n\n### Errors with No Ingredients to Smelt in Furnaces\n- Ensure a consistent supply of raw materials to furnaces to maintain continuous production. Check the input supply chain for any disruptions."}
