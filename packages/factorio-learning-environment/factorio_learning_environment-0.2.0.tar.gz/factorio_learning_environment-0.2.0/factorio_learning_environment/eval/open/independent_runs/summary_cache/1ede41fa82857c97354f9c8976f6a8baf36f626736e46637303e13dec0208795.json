{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) collecting iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0) for additional smelting capacity.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-14.5, -46.5) transferring items between entities.\n- Iron Chest at position (-14.5, -47.5) upgraded for increased storage capacity.\n\n### Coal Processing Facility at Position (41.5, -80.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) extracting coal.\n- Stone Furnace at position (43.0, -82.0) for smelting operations.\n- Iron Chest at position (41.5, -80.5) upgraded for increased storage capacity.\n- Burner Inserter at position (43.5, -80.5) transferring items between entities.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors due to inserters waiting for source items\n- Ensure that the source entities have the required items before the inserters attempt to transfer them.\n\n### Errors due to full chests\n- Regularly check and empty chests to prevent them from becoming full, which can halt production processes.\n\n### Errors due to furnaces having no ingredients to smelt\n- Ensure that furnaces are supplied with the necessary raw materials to maintain continuous operation."}
