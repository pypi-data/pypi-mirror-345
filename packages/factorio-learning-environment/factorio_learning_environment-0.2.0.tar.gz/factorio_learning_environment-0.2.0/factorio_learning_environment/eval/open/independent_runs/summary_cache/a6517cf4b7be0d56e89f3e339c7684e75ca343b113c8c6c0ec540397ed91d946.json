For example, ensure you have small electric poles in your inventory before attempting to place them.\n\n### Errors due to overlapping with water\n- Avoid placing entities on tiles where the footprint overlaps with water. Check the terrain before placing entities.\n\n### Errors due to no fuel in boilers\n- Ensure that boilers have the necessary fuel to operate. Regularly check and refill fuel as needed.\n\n### Errors due to disconnected steam engine\n- Ensure that the steam engine is properly connected to the electric network to function correctly."}
