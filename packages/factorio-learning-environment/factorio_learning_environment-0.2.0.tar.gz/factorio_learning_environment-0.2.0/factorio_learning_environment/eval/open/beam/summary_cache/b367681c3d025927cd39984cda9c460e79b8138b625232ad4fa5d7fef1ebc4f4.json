{"content": "Ah, now I understand the core issue. The error message is telling us that we don't have a stone furnace in our inventory to place. Let's analyze what we've learned:\n\n1. Current Status:\n- We can't place a furnace because we don't have one in inventory\n- We need to check our inventory first and craft/obtain necessary items\n\n2. Let's check what we have and what we need:\n\n```python\n# First, let's check our current inventory\nprint(f\"Current inventory: {inspect_inventory()}\")\n\n# Check if we can craft a stone furnace\nprint(f\"Available recipes: {get_craftable_items()}\")\n\n# If stone furnace is craftable, craft it\nif Prototype.StoneFurnace in get_craftable_items():\n    craft_item(Prototype.StoneFurnace, 1)\n    print(\"Crafted stone furnace\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Cannot craft stone furnace\")\n\n# Verify updated inventory\nprint(f\"Updated inventory: {inspect_inventory()}\")\n```\n\nThis should help us understand:\n1. What items we currently have\n2. Whether we can craft a stone furnace\n3. What we need to do next to get the required materials\n\nLet me know what the output shows and we can proceed with the next steps based on what resources are available.", "summary_range": "[1-528]"}
