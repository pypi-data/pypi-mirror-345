{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0) with a wooden chest at position (x=40.5, y=-83.5) storing coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=41.5, y=-83.5) transferring coal from the mining drill to the chest.\n- Additional wooden chests at positions (x=42.5, y=-83.5), (x=43.5, y=-83.5), and (x=44.5, y=-83.5) for coal storage.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=61.0, y=-54.0) with an inventory of iron plates.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=64.0, y=-53.0) with an inventory of iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=62.5, y=-53.5) and (x=65.5, y=-52.5) for transferring materials to and from the furnaces.\n- Wooden chest at position (x=61.5, y=-52.5) storing various materials including stone bricks and coal.\n\n### Belt Network\nConsists of multiple BeltGroups connecting various parts of the facility:\n- BeltGroup connecting inputs at (x=45.5, y=-82.5) to outputs at (x=67.5, y=-54.5).\n- BeltGroup connecting inputs at (x=43.5, y=-80.5) to outputs at (x=63.5, y=-50.5).\n- BeltGroup connecting inputs at (x=42.5, y=-81.5) to outputs at (x=65.5, y=-46.5).\n- BeltGroup connecting inputs at (x=44.5, y=-81.5) to outputs at (x=65.5, y=-54.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Belts\n- Ensure that the path for connecting belts is valid and clear of obstructions. The repeated failure to connect belts from (x=43.5, y=-81.5) to (x=65.0, y=-51.0) and (x=66.0, y=-51.0) indicates a need to verify the path and adjust the layout or clear any obstacles.\n\n### Errors with Inserters\n- Address the warnings of inserters waiting for source items by ensuring that the source inventory has the necessary items to transfer. This can be achieved by maintaining a steady supply of materials and monitoring the inventory levels.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `current_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Represents the current inventory of the agent, including items like 'wooden-chest', 'transport-belt', 'burner-inserter', 'coal', 'iron-ore', 'iron-plate', and 'iron-gear-wheel'.\n- `entities_on_map`: List[Entity] - Represents the list of entities currently on the map, including their positions and statuses."}
