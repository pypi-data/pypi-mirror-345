{"content": "Based on the new logs, I'll update the report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production (Position 0,0 and 2,0)\nTwo furnaces dedicated to producing iron plates:\n- Furnace 1 at (0,0) with coal fuel (11), processing iron ore (22) into iron plates (2)\n- Furnace 2 at (2,0) with coal fuel (12), processing iron ore (23) into iron plates (2)\nBoth furnaces are actively working\n\n### Copper Plate Production (Position 4,4 and 6,4)\nTwo furnaces dedicated to producing copper plates:\n- Furnace 3 at (4,4) with coal fuel (17), processing copper ore (7) into copper plates (7)\n- Furnace 4 at (6,4) with coal fuel (18), processing copper ore (7) into copper plates (7)\nBoth furnaces are actively working\n\n### Power Generation System (Position -7.5, 18.5)\nComplete power generation setup consisting of:\n- Steam engine at (-7.5, 18.5), working status, containing steam (200) at 165\u00b0\n- Boiler at (-7.5, 22.0), working status with coal fuel (6), containing water (199.9) and steam (147.5)\n- Offshore pump at (-7.5, 25.5), working status, containing water (99)\n- Connected pipe groups:\n  - Steam pipes at (-7.5, 15.5)\n  - Empty pipes at (-7.5, 20.5)\n  - Water pipes at (-8.5, 23.5)\n\n### Power Distribution Network\nExtensive power pole network operating at 600kV, connecting multiple areas including poles at:\n- (1.5, 17.5), (1.5, 16.5), (5.5, 15.5)\n- (7.5, 17.5), (-9.5, 18.5), (3.5, 6.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Research and Technology Issues\n- Use correct technology names: 'logistic-science-pack' instead of 'LogisticSciencePack'\n- Check if technology is already researched before attempting to research it again\n- Verify technology prerequisites and required science packs before researching\n\n### Lab Location and Access Issues\n- Lab positions are not being found despite extensive searching patterns\n- Current search methods (exact positions, near power poles, grid pattern) are ineffective\n- Consider implementing a more systematic search pattern or verifying lab existence\n\n### Resource Management\n- Monitor coal levels in boiler - currently running out of fuel frequently\n- Maintain consistent fuel supply to prevent power generation interruptions\n- Ensure proper resource distribution between furnaces and boiler\n\n### Recipe and Crafting Errors\n- Use correct prototype names for recipes\n- Verify recipe existence before attempting to craft items\n- For items requiring machine crafting (like iron plates), use appropriate assembly machines or furnaces instead of trying to hand craft\n\n### Entity Connection Issues\n- When connecting entities (like boiler to steam engine), ensure connection points are not blocked\n- Verify proper spacing and orientation before attempting to connect entities\n- Check if required connection points are accessible before placing pipes\n\n### Automation Science Pack Production\n- Cannot hand-craft automation science packs as they require machine assembly\n- Ensure proper production chain setup for sub-components like iron gear wheels\n- Set up dedicated assembly machines for automated production of science packs"}
