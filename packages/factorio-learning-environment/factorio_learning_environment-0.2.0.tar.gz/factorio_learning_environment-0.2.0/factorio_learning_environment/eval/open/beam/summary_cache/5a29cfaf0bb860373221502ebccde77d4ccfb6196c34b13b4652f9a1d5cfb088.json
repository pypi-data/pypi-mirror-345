{"content": "Great progress! You now have both coal and iron ore in your inventory. With these resources, you can start crafting essential items to automate the mining process. Here are the next steps:\n\n1. **Craft a Stone Furnace:**\n   - Stone furnaces are used to smelt iron ore into iron plates, which are crucial for crafting more advanced items.\n   - You will need stone to craft a stone furnace, so locate and harvest some stone.\n\n2. **Craft a Burner Mining Drill:**\n   - Burner mining drills are used to automate the mining of resources. They require iron plates and stone furnaces.\n   - Smelt the iron ore into iron plates using the stone furnace.\n\n3. **Set Up Automation:**\n   - Place the burner mining drill on an iron ore patch and fuel it with coal.\n   - Use the stone furnace to smelt the mined iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Tips for Success:\n- **Resource Management:** Keep an eye on your inventory and ensure you have enough resources to craft necessary items.\n- **Automation:** Focus on automating resource gathering as soon as possible to increase efficiency.\n- **Fuel Management:** Ensure you have a steady supply of coal to keep your drills and furnaces running.\n\n### Example Code for Crafting and Automation:\n```python\n# Locate and harvest stone\nstone_patch_position = nearest(Resource.Stone)\nmove_to(stone_patch_position)\nharvested_stone = harvest_resource(stone_patch_position, quantity=10)\n\n# Craft a stone furnace\ncraft_item(Item.StoneFurnace, quantity=1)\n\n# Smelt iron ore into iron plates\nplace_furnace(position=iron_ore_patch_position)\nadd_fuel_to_furnace(fuel_type='coal', quantity=5)\nsmelt_iron_ore(quantity=10)\n\n# Craft a burner mining drill\ncraft_item(Item.BurnerMiningDrill, quantity=1)\n\n# Place the burner mining drill on the iron ore patch\nplace_mining_drill(position=iron_ore_patch_position)\nadd_fuel_to_mining_drill(fuel_type='coal', quantity=5)\n```\n\nBy following these steps, you'll be able to set up a basic automated mining operation, which is a crucial foundation for expanding your factory in Factorio.", "summary_range": "[1-6]"}
