For example, the warning in multiple steps occurred because the chest at (-45.5, 1.5) was full.\n* Errors when Burner Mining Drill is out of fuel\n  - Ensure that the Burner Mining Drill is fueled before continuing to mine resources.\n* Errors when researching a technology that is already researched\n  - Check the current research status before attempting to research a technology.\n* Errors when attempting to place an entity at a position occupied by another entity\n  - Ensure that the target position is clear of other entities before attempting to place an entity.\n* Errors when using non-existent technology or prototype\n  - Ensure that the technology or prototype exists before attempting to use it.\n* Errors when inserting items into a full inventory\n  - Check if the inventory is full before attempting to insert items.\n* Errors when connecting entities without valid connections\n  - Ensure that the source and target connection points are not blocked and the target is able to receive the fluid from the source.\n* Errors when using invalid EntityGroup\n  - Ensure that the EntityGroup is valid before attempting to use it.\n* Errors when Electric Mining Drill is not receiving electricity\n  - Ensure that the Electric Mining Drill is connected to a valid power source. For example, the warning in multiple steps occurred because the Electric Mining Drill at (-47.5, 4.5) was not receiving electricity.\n* Errors when Boiler is out of fuel\n  - Ensure that the Boiler is fueled before continuing to produce steam.\n* Errors when extracting items from an empty chest\n  - Check if the chest is empty before attempting to extract items.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\nThe following variables have been assigned:\n- `stone`: count of stone resources (type: int)\n- `stone-brick`: count of stone-brick resources (type: int)\n\nThe following function has been defined:\n- `get_entities(entities: List[Prototype]) -> List[Entity]`: Returns a list of entities on the map that match the given prototype. \n  - Failure mode: IndexError when the list is empty.\n  - Success mode: Returns a list of entities when the list is not empty. \n- It is observed that the function `get_entities` has been used to access Steam Engines, but it returned an empty list, resulting in an IndexError. This suggests that the function is working as expected, but the agent needs to handle the case where the list is empty"}
