{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Stone Furnace Automation at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace positioned at (-15.0, -50.0) used for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest positioned at (-13.5, -49.5) serving as storage for iron plates output from the furnace.\n- Burner Inserter positioned at (-14.5, -48.5) that automates the transfer of iron plates from the furnace to the chest by extracting from the furnace and depositing into the chest.\n\nERROR TIPS\n### Errors with Incorrect Insertion Arguments and Inventory Checks\n- Always verify that the target entity, not just a positional coordinate, is passed as an argument when inserting items. Additionally, ensure that sufficient inventory is available before attempting the insertion.\n  \n### Insufficient Production Output Verification Failures\n- When asserting production outcomes, account for possible delays in smelting. Allow sufficient time for production to complete before validating outputs to avoid premature outcome checks.\n  \n### Resource Retrieval and Placement Timing Issues\n- Confirm that the resource location is correct and accessible prior to harvesting. Ensure synchronized timing between harvesting and inserting actions to maintain expected production cycles and inventory states.\n  \n### Cumulative Production Delay and Timeout Management\n- Monitor production cycles closely; adjust wait periods if smelting outputs are delayed to prevent premature assertions.\n  \n### Fuel Insertion and Inventory Availability Errors\n- When refueling entities such as inserters, verify that the inventory contains the required fuel item before attempting insertion. Ensure inventory checks are in place to avoid errors like attempting to insert coal when none is available.\n\nPrevious error tips regarding API usage, resource retrieval, insufficient fuel, insufficient input resources, and recipe access continue to apply unchanged."}
