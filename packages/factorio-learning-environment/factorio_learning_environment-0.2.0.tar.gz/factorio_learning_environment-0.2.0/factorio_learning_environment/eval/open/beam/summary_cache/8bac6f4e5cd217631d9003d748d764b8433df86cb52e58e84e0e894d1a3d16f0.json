{"content": "# The crafting of the wooden chest was successful, and my inventory now reflects that I have 1 wooden chest and 10 units of wood remaining.\n\n## Summary of Actions and Outcomes:\n1. **Inventory and Entities Check**: Initially, both the inventory and entities were empty.\n2. **Resource Gathering**: Successfully harvested 10 units of wood, increasing the inventory to 12 units of wood.\n3. **Crafting**: Crafted 1 wooden chest, resulting in an updated inventory of 1 wooden chest and 10 units of wood.\n\n## Tips and Successful Patterns:\n- **Inventory Inspection**: Using `inspect_inventory()` before crafting is a good practice to ensure you have enough resources.\n- **Resource Gathering**: Identifying and moving to the nearest resource (in this case, wood) is efficient for starting out in Factorio.\n- **Assertions**: Using assertions to check resource availability before crafting helps prevent runtime errors and ensures smooth execution.\n\n## Next Steps:\n- With the wooden chest crafted, I can now store additional resources. \n- I should consider gathering more resources (e.g., stone or iron) to expand my factory capabilities.\n- I can also look into crafting additional items, such as transport belts or inserters, to automate resource collection and processing.\n\n### Example of Future Code:\n```python\n# Gather more resources\nstone_position = nearest(Resource.Stone)\nmove_to(stone_position)\nharvest_resource(stone_position, quantity=10)  # Collecting 10 stone.\n\n# Check inventory after gathering stone\nprint(f\"Inventory changed to {inspect_inventory()}\")\n\n# Crafting a stone furnace if enough stone is collected\nassert inspect_inventory().get(Prototype.Stone, 0) >= 5, \"Not enough stone to craft a stone furnace.\"\ncraft_item(Prototype.StoneFurnace)\nprint(f\"Inventory changed to {inspect_inventory()}\")\n```\n\nThis pattern of gathering resources, checking inventory, and crafting will help build a solid foundation for your factory in Factorio.", "summary_range": "[1-6]"}
