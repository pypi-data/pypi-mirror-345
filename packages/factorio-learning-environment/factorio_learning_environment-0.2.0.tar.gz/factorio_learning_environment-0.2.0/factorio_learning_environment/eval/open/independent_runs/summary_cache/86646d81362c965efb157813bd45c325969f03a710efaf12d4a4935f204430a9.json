{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) with a status of NO_FUEL and warnings of 'out of fuel'.\n- Stone Furnace at position (41.0, -80.0) with a status of NO_FUEL and warnings of 'out of fuel'.\n- Wooden Chest at position (43.5, -79.5) with a status of NORMAL.\n\n### Iron Plate Mine at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) with a status of WORKING and fueled with coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) with a status of NORMAL.\n\n### Copper Furnace at Position (-20.0, -71.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -71.0) with a status of NO_FUEL and warnings of 'out of fuel' and 'no ingredients to smelt'.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors due to Insufficient Inventory\n- Ensure that you have enough resources in your inventory before attempting to insert items into entities. Specifically, make sure you have coal available before trying to insert it into furnaces or drills.\n\n### Errors when Entities Run Out of Fuel\n- Regularly check the fuel status of your mining drills and furnaces to prevent them from running out of fuel. Consider setting up a consistent fuel supply chain to maintain operational efficiency.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - `insert_item(item: Prototype, target: Entity, quantity: int)`: Used to insert items into entities. Ensure the inventory has sufficient items before calling this function to avoid exceptions.\n\n- **Variables:**\n  - `iron_furnace`: Represents the iron furnace entity used in the insertion process.\n  - `coal`: Integer representing the amount of coal in the inventory.\n  - `iron_ore`: Integer representing the amount of iron ore in the inventory.\n  - `iron_plate`: Integer representing the amount of iron plate in the inventory.\n  - `copper_plate`: Integer representing the amount of copper plate in the inventory."}
