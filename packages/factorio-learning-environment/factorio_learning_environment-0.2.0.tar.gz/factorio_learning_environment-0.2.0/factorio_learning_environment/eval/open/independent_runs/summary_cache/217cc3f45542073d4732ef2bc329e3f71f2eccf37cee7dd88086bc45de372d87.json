{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Smelting Area\nConsists of four stone furnaces:\n- Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Furnace at position (2.0, 0.0)\n- Furnace at position (4.0, 4.0)\n- Furnace at position (6.0, 4.0)\nAll furnaces are currently idle with no ingredients but have coal as fuel.\n\n### Power Generation System\nLocated around position (-2.5, 24.0), consists of:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Boiler at position (-2.5, 24.0)\n- Steam engine at position (4.5, 24.5)\n- Two pipe groups connecting the components:\n  - Water input pipes from pump to boiler\n  - Steam output pipes from boiler to steam engine\n- Electric pole network connecting power to other structures\n\n### Research Lab\n- Lab at position (10.5, 0.5)\n- Connected to power grid\n- Currently loaded with automation science packs\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inventory Management Errors\n- Ensure required materials are in inventory before attempting crafting operations\n- Check if raw materials need to be smelted in furnaces before they can be used in crafting\n\n### Entity Placement Errors\n- Verify you have the required entity in inventory before attempting to place it\n- When placing connected systems (like pipes), ensure you have all required connection components\n\n### Recipe and Crafting Errors\n- Some items (like copper plates) require smelting in furnaces and cannot be directly crafted\n- Raw resources like wood must be gathered from the environment, they cannot be crafted\n\n### Power System Errors\n- Ensure all components of power system are properly connected\n- Power-consuming entities need to be connected to the electricity network via electric poles\n\n### Programming/API Errors\n- When working with entity dimensions, use the correct attribute access method instead of direct arithmetic operations\n- Ensure proper error handling when dealing with entity placement and connections"}
