{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report (Steps 120-127)\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at position (-18.5, 69.5)\n(Still partially operational with persistent connection issues)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump (position x=-18.5 y=69.5) - working but water connection incomplete\n- Boiler (position x=-4.5 y=50.0) - now with 6 coal units, status FULL_OUTPUT\n- Steam engine (position x=0.5 y=50.5) - still not connected to power network\n- Pipe groups:\n  - Water pipes (positions: x=-18.5,y=67.5; x=-18.5,y=68.5) - connected to pump\n  - Steam pipes (positions: x=-6.5,y=50.5; x=-2.5,y=50.5) - boiler output connected\n- Power pole networks:\n  - Main grid (positions: x=0.5,y=53.5) - inactive\n  - Isolated pole at x=-50.5 y=18.5\n\n### New Power Plant at (0,0)\n(Now operational with fuel)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump (position x=-9.5 y=-2.5) - working\n- Boiler (position x=0.5 y=2.0) - now fueled with 9 coal\n- Steam engine (position x=0.5 y=7.5) - working but not connected to grid\n- Pipe groups:\n  - Water pipes (positions: x=-8.5,y=-2.5; x=-8.5,y=-1.5)\n  - Steam pipes (positions: x=0.5,y=0.5; x=1.5,y=0.5)\n\n### Stone Mining and Smelting Operation at position (-49.5, 10.5)\n(Unchanged from previous report)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill (position x=-49.5 y=10.5)\n- Stone furnace (position x=-46.0 y=11.0)\n- Input inserter (position x=-47.5 y=10.5)\n- Output chest (position x=-44.5 y=11.5)\n- Power pole (position x=-46.5 y=12.5)\n\n### Mining Operation at position (-52.5, 16.5)\n(Now operational with fuel)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill (position x=-52.5 y=16.5) - receiving stone but no power\n- Stone furnace (position x=-50.0 y=16.0) - working with coal (18 remaining)\n- Power pole (position x=-50.5 y=18.5) - still isolated\n\n### New Stone Mining Operation at (-46.0, 21.0)\n(Now operational but with output issues)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (position x=-46.0 y=21.0) - output blocked\n- Stone furnace (position x=-44.0 y=21.0) - now fueled with 7 coal\n\n### Coal Mining Operation at (16.0, 0.0)\n(Now operational)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (position x=16.0 y=0.0) - now fueled with 9 coal\n- Wooden chest (position x=16.5 y=1.5) - now receiving coal output\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Range Issues\n- Repeated attempts to place entities too far from character position\n  - Solutions:\n    1. Implement distance verification before placement\n    2. Add automatic movement to target position before building\n    3. Create range validation system\n\n### Inventory Management Failures\n- Attempting to place Assembling Machine 1 without having it in inventory\n  - Solutions:\n    1. Implement inventory checks before placement attempts\n    2. Add automatic crafting of missing items\n    3. Create resource tracking system\n\n### Production Chain Issues\n- Missing materials for Assembling Machine 1 (iron plates, gears, circuits)\n  - Solutions:\n    1. Implement prerequisite production verification\n    2. Add automatic setup of required production lines\n    3. Create dependency resolution system\n\n### Output Blocking Problems\n- Burner mining drill output blocked at (-46.0,21.0)\n  - Solutions:\n    1. Implement output destination verification\n    2. Add automatic inserter placement for blocked outputs\n    3. Create output monitoring system\n\n### Existing Issues from Previous Report\n- Entity placement conflicts\n- Attribute access errors\n- Fuel management problems\n- Construction sequence issues\n- Pipe connection problems\n- Water edge placement failures\n- Power system validation\n- Position validation"}
