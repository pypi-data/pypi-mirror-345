{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnaces**:\n  - Furnace at position (-16.0, -49.0): Fueled by coal, currently working with iron ore in its source inventory and producing iron plates.\n  - Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0): Fueled by coal, currently working with iron ore in its source inventory.\n- **Burner Inserters**:\n  - At position (-13.5, -47.5): Waiting for source items, connected to a furnace and a wooden chest.\n  - At position (-14.5, -45.5): Waiting for source items, connected to a transport belt and a wooden chest.\n  - At position (-11.5, -45.5): Waiting for source items, connected to a transport belt and an iron chest.\n  - At position (-9.5, -44.5): Waiting for source items, connected to a transport belt.\n  - At position (-14.5, -43.5): Waiting for source items, connected to a transport belt and a wooden chest.\n- **Chests**:\n  - Wooden chest at position (-13.5, -46.5): Empty.\n  - Wooden chest at position (-13.5, -44.5): Contains iron ore and iron plates.\n  - Iron chest at position (-11.5, -44.5): Empty.\n- **Belt Groups**:\n  - Belt group connecting positions (-11.5, -46.5) to (-9.5, -46.5), and (-8.5, -45.5) to (-8.5, -43.5).\n  - Belt group connecting positions (-12.5, -44.5) to (-12.5, -46.5), and (-12.5, -45.5) to (-11.5, -46.5).\n- **Individual Belts**:\n  - Belt from (-16.5, -48.5) to (-16.5, -46.5).\n  - Belt from (-14.5, -45.5) to (-14.5, -47.5).\n  - Belt from (-14.5, -45.5) to (-14.5, -43.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Blockage and Waiting Issues\n- **Blocked Inserters**: Ensure that the destination for inserters is not full to prevent blockages. Regularly clear the destination inventory to maintain flow.\n- **Inserters Waiting for Source Items**: Check the supply chain to ensure that source items are being provided to the inserters. This may involve ensuring that belts and chests are adequately stocked and connected.\n\n### Belt Direction and Connectivity\n- **Belt Output Issues**: Verify that belts are correctly aligned and connected to ensure smooth item transportation. Misaligned belts can disrupt the supply chain and lead to inserter waiting issues.\n\n### Incorrect Argument Usage in Optimization\n- **Entity Argument Errors**: Ensure that when using optimization functions, the second argument must be an Entity or EntityGroup. Avoid passing incorrect types like Position to prevent errors.\n\n### Nearby Entity Acceptance Issues\n- **Entity Acceptance Errors**: Ensure that there is a nearby entity that can accept the items being inserted. Verify the proximity and compatibility of entities to avoid insertion errors."}
