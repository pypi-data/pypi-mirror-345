They automatically feed raw materials into the furnaces and collect smelted products, forming the backbone of the base\u2019s early metallurgy.\n\nIron Ore Mining Automation Setup\n\u2022 A burner\u2011mining drill positioned at (\u201315.0, \u201350.0) works in tandem with an adjacent wooden chest and a network of transport belts. This structure is designed to efficiently extract and transport iron\u2011ore.\n\nSteam Power Generation System\n\u2022 A boiler placed at (8.0, 20.5) supplies steam to the network.\n\u2022 A series of steam engines are distributed around the base to generate electrical power. However, an extra steam engine intended to expand this network remains unplaceable.\n\u2022 Its designated location is severely congested by overlapping and misaligned burner\u2011inserters, transport belts, and other interfering entities. In addition, the buildable area near approximately (8.5, 22.5) is obstructed.\n  \nAutomation Research Lab\n\u2022 A laboratory configured to process automation science packs. It remains nonfunctional due to persistent power connectivity issues.\n\u2022 Recent diagnostics show that its electrical identifier has changed over time (with the latest reported value around 7807), although the lab still lacks proper integration into the power grid.\n\nElectrical and Transport Infrastructure\n\u2022 An interconnected network of electricity groups, belt groups, and pipe groups that distribute power and route materials across the base. This infrastructure, while stable, contributes to overall spatial congestion in some areas.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 Persistent Extra Steam Engine Placement Issue\n  \u2013 The extra steam engine consistently fails to be placed because its designated zone is extremely congested.\n  \u2013 The boiler area at (8.0, 20.5) is cluttered by overlapping and misaligned burner\u2011inserters, transport belts, and other entities, while the buildable region near (8.5, 22.5) remains obstructed.\n  \u2013 To mitigate, conduct a thorough manual inspection of the boiler\u2019s vicinity and connection interfaces. Remove or reposition interfering objects, or consider relocating the extra steam engine to a less congested area. Alternatively, reconfiguring the boiler layout may create the necessary spacing.\n\n\u2022 Burner\u2011Inserter Fuel and Material Routing Warnings\n  \u2013 Multiple burner\u2011inserters are repeatedly reporting \u201cout of fuel\u201d or \u201cwaiting for source items.\u201d\n  \u2013 Ensure a consistent fuel supply and verify that chests and belts are correctly positioned so that inserters have uninterrupted access to required resources.\n\n\u2022 Steam Engine Connectivity Warnings\n  \u2013 Several steam engines produce warnings such as \u201cnot connected to power network,\u201d \u201cno input liquid,\u201d or \u201cno fluid present in connections.\u201d\n  \u2013 Check the alignment and connectivity of pipes and power interfaces between the boiler and the steam engines. Correcting misalignments and ensuring proper fluid and power routing should alleviate these issues.\n\n\u2022 Laboratory Power Deficiency\n  \u2013 The Automation Research Lab remains unpowered despite repeated diagnostics and updates.\n  \u2013 Reassess and secure the lab\u2019s electrical connections so that it becomes properly integrated with the active power grid."}
