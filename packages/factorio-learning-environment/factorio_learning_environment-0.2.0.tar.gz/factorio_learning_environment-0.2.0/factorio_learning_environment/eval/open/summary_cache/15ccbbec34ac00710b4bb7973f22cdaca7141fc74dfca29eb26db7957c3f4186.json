{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron plate production setup at position (16.0, 71.0)\nConsists of the following entities arranged to produce iron plates from iron ore:\n- Burner mining drill at position (16.0, 71.0), facing down, extracting iron ore.\n- Stone furnace at position (16.0, 73.0), smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden chest at position (17.5, 73.5), collecting iron plates output from the furnace.\n- Burner inserter at position (18.5, 73.5), transferring iron plates from the furnace to the wooden chest.\n- Coal fuel inserted into both the burner mining drill and stone furnace to maintain operation.\n\nThis structure forms a compact iron plate production line with fuel supply and output collection.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter placement conflicts\n- Avoid placing inserters adjacent to tiles already occupied by other entities such as chests or inserters.\n- When placing an inserter next to a furnace or other entity, increase spacing, change the direction, or adjust the reference position to find a free tile.\n- Check for existing entities at the target position before placement to prevent placement failures.\n\n### Inventory insertion errors due to empty inventory\n- Ensure that the inventory contains the required items before attempting to insert them into entities.\n- Harvest or acquire necessary resources (e.g., iron ore, coal) before insertion commands.\n- Implement checks or conditional logic to verify inventory contents prior to insertion to avoid exceptions.\n\n### Variable reference errors\n- Define all variables before use; for example, ensure inserter entities are assigned to variables before attempting to insert items into them.\n- Use consistent and correct variable names to prevent NameError exceptions.\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nNo user-defined functions have been declared yet."}
