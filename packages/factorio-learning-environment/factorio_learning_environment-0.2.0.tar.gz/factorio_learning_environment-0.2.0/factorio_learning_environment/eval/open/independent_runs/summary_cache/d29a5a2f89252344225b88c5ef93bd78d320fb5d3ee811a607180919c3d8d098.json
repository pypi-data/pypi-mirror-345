{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n  - Refueled with coal and operational, extracting iron ore.\n  - Connected to a **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) for ore storage.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Stores extracted iron ore and iron plates.\n  - Connected to a **Burner Inserter**.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the stone furnace.\n  - Refueled with coal and operational.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0)\n  - Processes iron ore into iron plates.\n  - Currently contains 6 iron plates and is refueled with coal.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Insufficient Fuel for Operations\n- Ensure adequate coal supply in inventory to refuel mining drills, inserters, and furnaces to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Furnace Production Issues\n- Verify that the furnace has a sufficient supply of iron ore to process. The furnace frequently reported having no ingredients to smelt, indicating a need for better ore supply management.\n\n### Chest Capacity Management\n- Regularly empty the chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) to prevent mining operations from stalling due to a full chest."}
