{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal\n  - Current Status: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Function: Smelting iron ore into iron plates\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal\n  - Current Status: Waiting for space in destination\n  - Function: Extracting iron ore\n  - Warning: Output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities without having them in inventory\n- Ensure the required entity is available in the inventory before attempting to place it. For example, attempting to place a stone furnace or wooden chest without having them in the inventory resulted in errors.\n\n### Errors in crafting due to missing sub-ingredients\n- Check the availability of all required sub-ingredients before crafting an item. For instance, crafting a burner mining drill failed due to missing stone and iron plates.\n\n### Errors related to output blockage\n- Ensure there is a sink entity or storage to accept the output from mining drills to prevent blockage and inefficiencies.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `place_entity`: Attempts to place an entity at a specified position. Ensure the entity is available in inventory and the position is valid before calling this function.\n- `craft_item`: Attempts to craft a specified item. Verify all required sub-ingredients are available before invoking this function.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `furnace_position: Position` - Position where the stone furnace is placed.\n- `mining_drill_position: Position` - Position where the burner mining drill is placed.\n- `inventory: dict` - Current inventory of the agent, includes items like coal, stone, iron plates, and iron gear wheels."}
