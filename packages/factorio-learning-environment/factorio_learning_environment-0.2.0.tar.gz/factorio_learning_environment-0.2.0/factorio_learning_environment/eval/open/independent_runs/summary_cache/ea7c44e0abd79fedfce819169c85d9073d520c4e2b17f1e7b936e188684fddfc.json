{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (-1.5, 24.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting these entities\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Furnace at Position (-19.0, -73.0)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0)\n\n### Additional Furnace\nConsists of:\n- Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0)\n\n### Storage and Inserter System\nConsists of:\n- Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5)\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) connected to the chest and furnace\n- Wooden Chest at Position (6.5, -59.5)\n\n### Research Lab\nConsists of:\n- Lab at Position (not specified), currently not receiving power\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Attribute Errors with PipeGroup\n- Ensure that the PipeGroup object is correctly initialized and has the necessary attributes before attempting operations like `pickup_entity`.\n\n### Placement Blockage Errors\n- Verify that the target tiles are unoccupied and suitable for placing entities like pipes and boilers to avoid blockage errors.\n\n### Connection Errors with Small Electric Poles\n- Ensure that small electric poles are properly connected to each other and to the entities they are supposed to power. Check for any nil values or incorrect indexing in the connection logic.\n\n### Steam Engine Not Generating Power\n- Confirm that the steam engine is correctly connected to the boiler and offshore pump, and that there is a continuous supply of water and fuel to generate power.\n\n### No Ingredients to Smelt Warnings\n- Ensure that furnaces have the required ingredients to smelt, such as ore, to avoid idle warnings.\n\n### No Power Warnings\n- Check that all entities requiring power are connected to an active power network and that the network is generating sufficient electricity."}
