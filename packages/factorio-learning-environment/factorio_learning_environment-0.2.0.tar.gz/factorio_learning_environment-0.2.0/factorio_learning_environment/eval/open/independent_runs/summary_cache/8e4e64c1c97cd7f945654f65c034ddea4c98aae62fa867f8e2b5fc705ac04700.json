{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Smelting Area at (0,0)\nConsists of four furnaces in a row:\n- Stone furnace at (0.0, 0.0)\n- Stone furnace at (2.0, 0.0)\n- Stone furnace at (4.0, 4.0)\n- Stone furnace at (6.0, 4.0)\n\n### Copper Smelting Area at (0,4)\nConsists of two furnaces:\n- Stone furnace at (0.0, 4.0)\n- Stone furnace at (2.0, 4.0)\n\n### Research Lab Setup at (8.5, 0.5)\n- Lab building containing automation science packs (currently without power)\n\n### Power Generation System near (-9.5, 24.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Boiler at (-9.5, 23.0)\n- Steam engine at (-9.5, 19.5)\nCurrently not operational due to missing connections between components\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Inventory Management Errors\n- Ensure required materials are in inventory before attempting insertion operations\n- Check inventory for required items before attempting to craft or place entities\n\n### Entity Placement Errors\n- When placing steam engines, ensure the terrain is suitable and there are no obstacles\n- Check terrain conditions (like water tiles) before attempting to place structures\n\n### Power System Connection Errors\n- Power generation components (offshore pump, boiler, steam engine) need proper connections to function\n- Ensure proper piping between offshore pump and boiler\n- Verify steam engine placement allows for proper connection to boiler\n\n### Crafting Errors\n- Complex items like labs require multiple sub-components - ensure all prerequisites can be crafted\n- When crafting items requiring machine assembly (like copper plates), ensure proper production facilities are in place first\n\n### API Usage Errors\n- BuildingBox creation failed due to incorrect attribute access - review API documentation for correct property access\n- When connecting entities, ensure proper prototype specification for connection types"}
