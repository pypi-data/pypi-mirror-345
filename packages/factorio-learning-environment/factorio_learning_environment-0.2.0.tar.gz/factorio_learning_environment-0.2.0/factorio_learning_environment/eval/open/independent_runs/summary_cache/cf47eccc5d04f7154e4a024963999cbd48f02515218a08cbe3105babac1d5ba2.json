For example, 'BeltGroup' does not have a 'prototype' attribute. Verify object types and their attributes before accessing them.\n\n### AssertionError in Function Calls\n- When using functions like `insert_item`, ensure that the arguments passed are of the correct type. For instance, the second argument should be an Entity or EntityGroup, not a Position. Double-check the function signatures and expected argument types.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
