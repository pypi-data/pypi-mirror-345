{"content": "# Factorio Game Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0) fueled by coal, currently working with iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter 1** at position (1.5, 0.5) transferring iron plates from the furnace to a wooden chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (2.5, 0.5) storing iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter 2** at position (3.5, 0.5) extracting items from the wooden chest and placing them onto a transport belt.\n- **Transport Belt** connecting the burner inserter at position (3.5, 0.5) to the burner inserter at position (6.5, 0.5).\n- **Burner Inserter 3** at position (6.5, 0.5) transferring iron plates from the transport belt to an end chest.\n- **End Wooden Chest** at position (7.5, 0.5) collecting iron plates from the belt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities on Occupied Tiles\n- Ensure that the target tile is unoccupied before attempting to place an entity. Consider adjusting the spacing, direction, or reference position if placement fails due to an existing entity.\n\n### Errors when Connecting Belts Directly from a Chest\n- Use an inserter to extract items from a chest before connecting them to a transport belt. Direct connections from a chest to a belt are not possible.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Inventory Items\n- Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to place or craft entities. For example, gather wood before crafting a wooden chest.\n\n### Errors in Crafting Due to Missing Raw Resources\n- Gather necessary raw resources, such as wood, before attempting to craft items that require them. Raw resources cannot be crafted and must be collected from the environment."}
