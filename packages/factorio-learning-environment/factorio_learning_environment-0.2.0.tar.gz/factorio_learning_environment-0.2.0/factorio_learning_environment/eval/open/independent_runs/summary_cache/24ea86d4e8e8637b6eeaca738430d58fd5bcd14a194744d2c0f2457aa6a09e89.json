{"content": "Here's the report based on the provided logs:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining Operation at position(41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (position 41.0, -82.0) mining coal\n- Wooden chest for coal storage (position 41.5, -80.5)\n- Burner inserter (position 42.5, -80.5) moving coal from chest to belt system\n- Belt group with 3 transport belts moving right (positions 43.5 to 45.5, -80.5)\n\n### Standalone Furnace at position(-15.0, -50.0)\n- Stone furnace currently without ingredients\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Inventory Management Errors\n- Cannot place entities (splitter, wooden chest) that are not in inventory\n- Check inventory before attempting to place new structures\n\n### Belt System Issues\n- Belt groups are frequently being blocked and need removal\n- Ensure proper belt flow and capacity management\n\n### Inserter Capacity Issues\n- Burner inserter getting blocked due to full fuel capacity (50/50)\n- Monitor and manage inserter fuel levels before attempting to add more\n\n### Connection Planning Errors\n- Cannot connect transport belts directly to furnaces\n- Use inserters as intermediaries when connecting belts to furnaces\n\n### Chest Management\n- Chest getting full and blocking the mining operation\n- Implement proper overflow management or ensure regular extraction\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nFunctions:\n- `place_entity()`: Places entities on the map. Fails if item not in inventory or position occupied\n- `insert_item(prototype, target, quantity)`: Inserts items into entities. Fails if target full\n- `get_connection_amount(pos1, pos2, prototype)`: Calculates connection distance between positions\n\nImportant Variables:\n- `output_inserter`: BurnerInserter type\n- `overflow_chest`: Chest type\n- `fuel_belt2`: TransportBelt type\n- `splitter`: Splitter type"}
