{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, y=-60.0) with a drop position at (4.5, y=-58.5). This drill is currently operational but has a warning that the chest at the drop position is full.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (4.5, y=-58.5), (5.5, y=-60.5), (6.5, y=-60.5), (7.5, y=-60.5), (8.5, y=-60.5), and (9.5, y=-60.5). The chest at (4.5, y=-58.5) is storing iron ore.\n- **Iron Chest** at position (-5.5, y=-50.5) storing iron ore and iron plates.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (-15.0, y=-48.0), (-13.0, y=-48.0), and (-11.0, y=-48.0), each fueled with coal and processing iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-14.5, y=-50.5), (-13.5, y=-50.5), (-12.5, y=-50.5), (-11.5, y=-50.5), (-10.5, y=-50.5), (-9.5, y=-50.5), (-8.5, y=-50.5), (-7.5, y=-50.5), and (-6.5, y=-50.5). Several chests are full of iron plates, specifically at positions (-11.5, y=-50.5), (-10.5, y=-50.5), (-9.5, y=-50.5), and (-8.5, y=-50.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Full Chests\n- Ensure that chests used for storing mined resources or processed materials have enough capacity. Regularly check and empty full chests to prevent halting of operations.\n\n### Errors with Mining Drill Warnings\n- Address warnings from mining drills promptly. If a mining drill indicates that the chest at its drop position is full, empty the chest to allow continued mining operations.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `iron_ore_count: int` - Represents the count of iron ore extracted and stored.\n- `iron_plate_count: int` - Represents the count of iron plates stored.\n- `coal_count: int` - Represents the count of coal used as fuel in furnaces and mining drills.\n- `furnace_fuel: Inventory` - Represents the fuel inventory for each furnace.\n- `chest_inventory: Inventory` - Represents the inventory of each chest, including warnings for full chests."}
