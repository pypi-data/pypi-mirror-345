Status updated to FULL_OUTPUT after recent refuel. Connection points: (-5.5, 22.5) and (-5.5, 26.5); steam output at (-7.5, 24.5).\n- Offshore Pump at position(-9.5, 24.5) for water extraction.\n- Steam Engine at position(2.5, 21.5) for electricity generation. Status: NOT_CONNECTED with warnings: [\"not connected to power network\", \"no input liquid\", \"no fluid present in connections\"].\n- Pipeline Network: Multiple segmented pipeline connection attempts using manually placed pipes and intermediate waypoints (including positions such as (-3.5, 23.5), (-7.5, 23.0), (0.0, 21.5), (-4.0, 23.5), (0.0, 22.5), (-6.5, 23.5), and (-3.0, 22.5)) have failed to establish a continuous connection from the boiler\u2019s steam output to the steam engine.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 Connection and Repositioning Errors:\n\u2003\u2013 Ensure both source and target connection points are clear, well-aligned, and within the allowed placement range.\n\u2003\u2013 Validate that manually placed pipes are within maximum placement distances and free from obstructions.\n\n\u2022 Fluid Mismatch and Contamination:\n\u2003\u2013 Confirm that the fluid present in a source pipeline matches what is expected by the target entity.\n\u2003\u2013 Clear any extraneous or unintended fluids from pipeline segments before attempting connections.\n\n\u2022 Multi-Segment Pipeline Construction and Network Integration Challenges:\n\u2003\u2013 Adjust intermediate waypoint positions carefully to align with both source and target connection points.\n\u2003\u2013 Verify the compatibility of each pipeline segment and ensure that working PipeGroups (with appropriate fluid system identifiers) exist before merging networks.\n\n\u2022 Inventory and Resource Management:\n\u2003\u2013 Pre-check inventory levels (for example, ensuring sufficient coal for boiler refuel) to avoid resource-related interruptions.\n\n\u2022 General Placement and Stabilization:\n\u2003\u2013 Allow adequate stabilization time after clearing obstructions or repositioning entities to ensure target areas remain unobstructed for connection attempts."}
