{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (4.0, -60.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, -60.0), currently working and fueled with coal. It has a warning indicating that the chest at drop position (4.5, -58.5) is full.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (5.5, -60.5), (4.5, -58.5), and several others, storing iron plates and iron ore.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (-15.0, -48.0), (-13.0, -48.0), and (-11.0, -48.0), each with warnings of no ingredients to smelt, indicating they are not currently processing materials.\n\n### Storage Area\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Multiple **Wooden Chests** and **Iron Chests** located primarily around positions (-4.5, -52.5) to (-14.5, -50.5), storing a variety of resources including iron plates and iron ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Full Inventory\n- Ensure that chests at drop positions are regularly emptied to prevent mining drills from halting operations due to full inventories.\n\n### Errors Related to No Ingredients in Furnaces\n- Regularly supply stone furnaces with necessary ingredients to maintain continuous production. This involves ensuring a steady supply of iron ore to the furnaces.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions**: None defined in the current steps.\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `burner_mining_drill_position`: Position(x=4.0, y=-60.0)\n  - `chest_positions`: List of positions where chests are located, such as (5.5, -60.5), (4.5, -58.5), etc.\n  - `furnace_positions`: List of positions where furnaces are located, such as (-15.0, -48.0), (-13.0, -48.0), etc.\n  - `inventory`: Dict containing current inventory items such as {'wooden-chest': 2, 'coal': 30, 'iron-ore': 100, 'iron-plate': 7500, 'iron-gear-wheel': 4}."}
