{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5).\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Transport System at Position (-23.0, -68.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) with a drop position at Wooden Chest (position -23.5, -69.5).\n- Transport Belt network connecting various positions including (-24.5, -69.5) and (-21.5, -67.5).\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) connected to Wooden Chests at positions (-14.5, -54.5) and (-12.5, -54.5).\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5) facilitating transfer between chests.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-21.0, -62.0) processing iron ore with output storage at Wooden Chest (position -20.5, -63.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Storage and Transfer System at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with output to Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5).\n- Burner Inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) transferring items between chests at positions (1.5, 0.5) and (3.5, 0.5).\n\n### Belt Systems\nConsists of multiple BeltGroups facilitating transport across various positions:\n- BeltGroup connecting positions such as (-25.5, -70.5) to (-23.5, -70.5) and (-21.5, -66.5) to (-21.5, -68.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Insufficient Inventory\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to place an entity. For example, attempting to place a wooden chest at (54.0, -84.5) failed due to lack of wooden chests in inventory.\n\n### Errors with Full Storage\n- Regularly check and empty storage chests to prevent mining drills and inserters from halting operations due to full inventories. For instance, the chest at (52.5, -84.5) is full, causing the mining drill to stop.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Items\n- Ensure that the source items are available for inserters to function properly. For example, the burner inserter at (-16.5, -69.5) is waiting for source items, indicating a potential supply chain issue."}
