{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) connected to a Stone Furnace at position (41.0, -80.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (43.5, -79.5) for storage\n\n### Iron Plate Mine at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) for storage\n\n### Copper Furnace at Position (-20.0, -71.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -71.0) currently out of fuel and lacking ingredients to smelt\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Inventory Items\n- Ensure you have sufficient items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities. For example, the error at step 938 occurred due to a lack of coal in the inventory when trying to insert into a copper drill.\n\n### Timeout Errors\n- Monitor the execution time of operations to prevent TimeoutErrors, as seen in step 937. Consider optimizing the code or breaking down tasks into smaller, more manageable operations.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Defined Functions\n- `insert_item`: A function used to insert items into entities. It failed in step 938 due to insufficient inventory items.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `copper_drill`: Represents the copper mining drill entity. Used in the `insert_item` function.\n- `iron_furnace`: Represents the iron furnace entity. Used for inserting iron ore and coal."}
