{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (4.0, y=-60.0) with a drop position at (4.5, y=-58.5)\n- Wooden Chests at positions:\n  - (5.5, y=-60.5)\n  - (4.5, y=-58.5) containing 41 iron ore\n  - (-5.5, y=-52.5) containing 432 iron ore\n  - (-14.5, y=-50.5) containing 100 iron ore\n  - (-13.5, y=-50.5) containing 100 iron ore\n  - (-12.5, y=-50.5) containing 100 iron ore\n  - (-11.5, y=-50.5) containing 1590 iron plates\n  - (-10.5, y=-50.5) containing 1600 iron plates (full)\n  - (-9.5, y=-50.5) containing 1445 iron plates\n  - (-8.5, y=-50.5) containing 1445 iron plates\n  - (-7.5, y=-50.5) containing 665 iron plates\n  - (-6.5, y=-50.5) containing 1550 iron plates\n  - (-5.5, y=-50.5) containing 326 iron ore and 1700 iron plates\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnaces at positions:\n  - (-15.0, y=-48.0) with warnings for no ingredients and full result\n  - (-13.0, y=-48.0) with warnings for no ingredients and full result\n  - (-11.0, y=-48.0) with warnings for no ingredients and full result\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors due to Full Chests\n- Ensure that chests are regularly emptied to prevent production halts. The chest at position (4.5, y=-58.5) is full, which stops the mining drill from working.\n\n### Errors in Furnace Operations\n- Furnaces at positions (-15.0, y=-48.0), (-13.0, y=-48.0), and (-11.0, y=-48.0) are not operating due to lack of ingredients and full output. Ensure that ingredients are supplied and outputs are cleared to maintain continuous production.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- No utility functions have been defined by the agent in the given steps.\n- Important variables:\n  - `iron_ore_inventory: Dict[str, int]` - Tracks the amount of iron ore in various chests.\n  - `iron_plate_inventory: Dict[str, int]` - Tracks the amount of iron plates in various chests."}
