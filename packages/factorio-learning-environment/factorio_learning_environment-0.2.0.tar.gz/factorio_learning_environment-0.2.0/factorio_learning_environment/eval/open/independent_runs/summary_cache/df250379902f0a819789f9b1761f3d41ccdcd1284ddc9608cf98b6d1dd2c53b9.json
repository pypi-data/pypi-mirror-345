{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Basic Steam Power Generation at x=-5.5 y=2.0\nThis setup generates electricity using steam. It was refueled during this period but structurally unchanged.\n-   **Components:**\n    -   Offshore Pump at x=-9.5 y=-0.5 (Extracts water)\n    -   PipeGroup connecting pump to boiler (Transport water)\n        -   Pipes at: (x=-8.5,y=-0.5), (x=-7.5,y=-0.5), (x=-7.5,y=0.5), (x=-7.5,y=1.5)\n    -   Boiler at x=-5.5 y=2.0 (Heats water into steam using fuel)\n    -   Wooden Chest at x=-2.5 y=1.5 (Stores fuel for the boiler)\n    -   Burner Inserter at x=-3.5 y=1.5 (Moves fuel from chest to boiler)\n    -   Steam Engine at x=-2.5 y=5.5 (Consumes steam to generate electricity)\n    -   PipeGroup connecting boiler to steam engine (Transport steam)\n        -   Pipes at: (x=-5.5,y=3.5), (x=-2.5,y=2.5), ... (multiple pipes connecting)\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at x=-47.5 y=79.5\nThis setup mines copper ore and smelts it into copper plates using electricity.\n-   **Components:**\n    -   Electric Mining Drill at x=-47.5 y=79.5 (Mines copper ore)\n    -   Stone Furnace at x=-47.0 y=82.0 (Smelts copper ore into plates)\n    -   Wooden Chest at x=-44.5 y=82.5 (Stores fuel for the furnace)\n    -   Inserter at x=-45.5 y=82.5 (Moves fuel from chest to furnace)\n    -   Connected to the main power grid via Small Electric Poles (e.g., at x=-45.5 y=77.5, x=-45.5 y=81."}
