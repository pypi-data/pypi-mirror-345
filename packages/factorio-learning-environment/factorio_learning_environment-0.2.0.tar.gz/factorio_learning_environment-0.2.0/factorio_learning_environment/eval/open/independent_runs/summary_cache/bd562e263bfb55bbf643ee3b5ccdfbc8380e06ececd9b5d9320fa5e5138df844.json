{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at Position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\n- Boiler at Position (x=1.5, y=23.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\n- PipeGroup for steam, connecting various positions including (x=3.5, y=17.5) to (x=10.5, y=21.5)\n- PipeGroup for water, connecting various positions including (x=-9.5, y=23.5) to (x=-0.5, y=23.5)\n\n### Electricity Distribution Network\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at positions such as (x=27.5, y=26.5), (x=3.5, y=20.5), (x=14.5, y=20.5), and others, with a voltage of 0.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure that the positions for connecting pipes are accurate and that the entities being connected are compatible. In the case of connecting a pipe to a steam engine, verify that the connection points and types are correct to avoid failures.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Defined Utility Functions\n- `connect_entities(steam_output_position, steam_engine_position, Prototype.Pipe)`: This function attempts to connect entities using pipes. It failed due to incorrect connection points or incompatible entity types.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `steam_output_position`: Position type, used for connecting steam output.\n- `steam_engine_position`: Position type, used for connecting to the steam engine.\n- `Prototype.Pipe`: Entity type, used for specifying the type of connection in utility functions."}
