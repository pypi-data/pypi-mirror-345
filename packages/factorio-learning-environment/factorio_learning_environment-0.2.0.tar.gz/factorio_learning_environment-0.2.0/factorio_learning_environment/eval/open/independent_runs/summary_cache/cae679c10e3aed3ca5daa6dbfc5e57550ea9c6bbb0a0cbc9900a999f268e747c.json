{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Crude Oil Extraction Structure at position (20.5, 43.5)\nConsists of:\n- Pumpjack (position: x=20.5, y=43.5)\n- Boiler (position: x=15.5, y=44.0)\n- Steam Engine (position: x=11.5, y=44.5)\n- Offshore Pump (position: x=-9.5, y=-0.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting offshore pump to boiler (positions: x=-8.5 y=-0.5, x=-7.5 y=-0.5, ..., x=17.5 y=43.5, x=17.5 y=42.5, x=17.5 y=44.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting pumpjack to oil refinery (positions: x=21.5 y=41.5, x=23.5 y=41.5, ..., x=24.5 y=50.5, x=27.5 y=50.5, x=26.5 y=50.5)\n- ElectricityGroup connecting steam engine to pumpjack and oil refinery (poles at positions: x=11.5 y=46.5, x=15.5 y=46.5, x=22.5 y=45.5, x=23.5 y=44.5, x=19.5 y=46.5, x=22.5 y=43.5)\n\n### Oil Refinery Structure at position (26.5, 46.5)\nConsists of:\n- Oil Refinery (position: x=26.5, y=46.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using entities without proper setup or connection\n- Ensure that entities like pumpjacks and oil refineries are properly connected to power networks and have the necessary inputs (e.g., crude oil for oil refineries, fuel for boilers).\n- Make sure that entities are not placed too close to each other to avoid collisions.\n\n### Errors due to undefined variables\n- Ensure that variables are defined before they are used. For example, 'offshore_pump' and 'storage_tank' were used without being defined.\n\n### Errors when asserting entity status\n- Check the status of entities after placing or connecting them. For example, the pumpjack and oil refinery were not working due to lack of power or improper connections.\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure that the target position is within the maximum allowed distance. For example, the error \"The target position is too far away to place the entity\" occurred when trying to place a small-electric-pole at (15.5, 46.5).\n- Ensure that there are no existing objects in the way when placing entities. For example, the error \"Could not find a suitable position to place small-electric-pole at the target location, as there is an existing object in the way\" occurred when trying to place a small-electric-pole at (13.5, 44.5).\n\n### Errors when placing entities next to other entities\n- Ensure that the direction and spacing are correctly specified when placing entities next to other entities. For example, the error \"Cannot place entity at the position {x = 22.5, y = 46.5 with the current direction\" occurred when trying to place a storage-tank next to the oil refinery.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n\n* `place_entity_next_to(entity_type, reference_position, direction) -> Entity`: Places an entity of the given type next to the reference position in the specified direction. \n    + Failure modes: \n        - Could not place entity due to collision with existing entities or invalid placement position.\n    + Success modes: \n        - Successfully placed the entity.\n* `get_entity(entity_type, position) -> Entity`: Retrieves an entity of the given type at the specified position.\n    + Failure modes: \n        - No entity of the given type found at the specified position.\n    + Success modes: \n        - Successfully retrieved the entity.\n* `place_entity(entity_type, position) -> Entity`: Places an entity of the given type at the specified position.\n    + Failure modes: \n        - Could not place entity due to collision with existing entities or invalid placement position.\n        - Target position is too far away.\n    + Success modes: \n        - Successfully placed the entity.\n\n### Important Variables\n\n* `pumpjack`: Pumpjack entity (type: Entity)\n* `oil_refinery`: Oil Refinery entity (type: Entity)\n* `boiler`: Boiler entity (type: Entity)\n* `steam_engine`: Steam Engine entity (type: Entity)\n* `offshore_pump`: Offshore Pump entity (type: Entity)"}
