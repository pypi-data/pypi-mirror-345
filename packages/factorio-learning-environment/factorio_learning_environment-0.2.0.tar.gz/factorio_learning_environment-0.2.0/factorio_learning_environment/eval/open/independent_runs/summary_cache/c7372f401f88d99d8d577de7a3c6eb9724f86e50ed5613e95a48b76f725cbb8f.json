{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-9.5, 24.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5) [Status: WORKING]\n- Boiler at position (-10.5, 21.0) [Status: NOT_CONNECTED]\n- Steam Engine at position (-13.5, 23.5) [Status: NOT_CONNECTED]\n- Pipe groups connecting various positions, including:\n  - Pipe-group at position (-9.5, 23.5) [Status: FULL_OUTPUT]\n  - Other pipe-groups at positions (-10.5, 23.5), (-10.5, 22.5), (-7.5, 23.5), (-5.5, 16.5), (-5.5, 24.5), (-4.5, 16.5), (-4.5, 24.5) [Status: EMPTY]\n\n### Stone Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) [Status: NO_INGREDIENTS]\n\n### Electricity Network\n- Electricity-group at position (-3.6666666666666665, 20.214285714285715) [Status: NOT_PLUGGED_IN_ELECTRIC_NETWORK]\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing or Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure there is sufficient inventory of pipes before attempting to place them. Multiple attempts failed due to \"No pipe in inventory.\"\n- Verify that the target location for placing pipes or pipe-to-ground is clear of existing objects to avoid placement errors.\n- Avoid placing pipe-to-ground on water tiles as it results in an overlap error. Choose a different location that is suitable for placement.\n- When connecting underground pipes, ensure that the connection path is valid and clear of obstacles to avoid connection failures.\n\n### Errors with Entity Connection\n- Ensure that all components of the electricity generator (boiler, steam engine) are correctly connected to function properly. The current setup shows components as NOT_CONNECTED.\n- Verify that the electricity network is properly plugged in to avoid \"NOT_PLUGGED_IN_ELECTRIC_NETWORK\" status.\n\n### Errors with Stone Furnace\n- Provide necessary ingredients to the stone furnace to change its status from NO_INGREDIENTS to operational."}
