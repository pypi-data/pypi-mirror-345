{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace (position (0.0, 0.0)) with a full inventory of coal (50/50) and producing iron plates (45 iron plates currently).\n\n### Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest (position (-14.5, -48.5)) with an inventory containing 606 iron ore.\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position (-15.0, -50.0)) currently out of fuel and unable to drop items into the full wooden chest at (-14.5, -48.5).\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when trying to insert items into a full inventory\n- Ensure that the target entity (like a furnace or chest) has available space before attempting to insert items. In this case, the stone furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) was full, preventing the insertion of coal.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items. The agent has been extracting from the wooden chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) but may need to ensure the drill is operational to avoid delays.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n#### Utility Functions\n- `insert_item(item_type, target_entity, quantity)`: \n  - **Failure Mode**: Could not insert items if the target entity's inventory is full.\n  - **Success Mode**: Successfully inserts items if there is space in the target entity's inventory.\n\n#### Important Variables\n- `furnace`: type `Furnace`\n- `wooden_chest`: type `Chest`\n- `burner_mining_drill`: type `BurnerMiningDrill`\n- `inventory`: type `Inventory` (current items include 'wood', 'coal', 'iron-ore', 'iron-plate')"}
