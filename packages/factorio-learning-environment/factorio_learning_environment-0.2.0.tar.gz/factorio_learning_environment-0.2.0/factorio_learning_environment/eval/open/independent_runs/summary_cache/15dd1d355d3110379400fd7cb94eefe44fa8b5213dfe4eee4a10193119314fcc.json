{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo new structures have been successfully placed on the map. Although the agent interacted with existing furnaces (e.g. one at (5.0, 5.0) for smelting iron ore and another at (\u201327.0, \u201360.0) for copper ore), no structure built by the agent (such as a Lab) was ever successfully created. All attempts to place a Lab at (0.5, 2.5) failed due to inventory and crafting issues.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 API Usage Errors\n\u2003\u2013 When calling get_entities, use the correct function signature. Avoid unsupported keyword arguments (such as \u201cradius\u201d) and ensure the number of positional arguments matches the API\u2019s definition.\n\u2003\n\u2022 Null Reference Handling\n\u2003\u2013 Always confirm the return value from get_entities is not None before iterating over it. Use a fallback (like an empty list) to prevent \u201cNoneType\u201d iteration errors.\n\u2003\n\u2022 Lab Placement Failures\n\u2003\u2013 Verify the Lab item exists in inventory prior to attempting placement. Checking inventory centralizes resource availability and avoids placement errors.\n\u2003\n\u2022 Crafting Process and Resource Shortage\n\u2003\u2013 Ensure that all sub-ingredients (for example, iron-gear-wheels, electronic circuits, and copper cables) are available in sufficient quantities before beginning Lab crafting. Establish that every production chain for lab components is fully operational to prevent cascading crafting failures.\n\n"}
