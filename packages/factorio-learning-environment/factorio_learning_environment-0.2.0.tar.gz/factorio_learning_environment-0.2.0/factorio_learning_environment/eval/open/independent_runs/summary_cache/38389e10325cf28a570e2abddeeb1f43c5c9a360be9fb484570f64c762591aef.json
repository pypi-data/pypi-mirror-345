{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo new structures have been successfully created on the map. Multiple attempts were made to locate, place, and craft a Lab at (0.5, 2.5) for supplying Automation Science Packs, but none were completed due to resource and placement issues. Although furnaces were referenced for smelting operations\u2014one at Position(x=5.0, y=5.0) for iron plate production and a copper furnace at Position(x=-27.0, y=-60.0) for copper plate production\u2014no composite structure was successfully constructed as a result of these actions.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 API Call Errors\n\u2003\u2013 When using get_entities, ensure the function is invoked with the correct signature. Avoid using unexpected keyword arguments (such as \u201cradius\u201d) or providing extra positional arguments.\n\u2022 Lab Placement and Inventory Checks\n\u2003\u2013 Verify that the Lab exists in the inventory before attempting placement. Confirm resource availability to avoid placement failures.\n\u2022 Entity Retrieval Validation\n\u2003\u2013 Always check that the result from an entity-retrieval call is a valid, iterable collection rather than None before processing.\n\u2022 Lab Crafting Resource Shortages\n\u2003\u2013 Monitor the production chain and ensure all required sub-ingredients (e.g. iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, copper-cables) are available. Address any gaps in resource processing (such as insufficient smelted iron or copper plates) prior to retrying Lab crafting."}
