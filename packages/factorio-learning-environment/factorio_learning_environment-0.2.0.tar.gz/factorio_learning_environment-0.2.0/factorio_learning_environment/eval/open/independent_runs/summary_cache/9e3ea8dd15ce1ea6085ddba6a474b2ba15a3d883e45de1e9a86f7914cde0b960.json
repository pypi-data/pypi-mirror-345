Check your inventory status before insertion.\n\n### Errors when the furnace result is full\n- Monitor the output inventory of the furnaces to avoid inserting more ingredients when the result inventory is full. Remove excess items from the output before inserting more raw materials.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items to avoid extraction failures. \n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it. Check for existing entities in the target position."}
