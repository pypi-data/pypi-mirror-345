{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Electricity generator at position(x=1.5, y=1.0)\nConsists of steam engine, boiler at position(x=1.5, y=1.0) and offshore pump at position(x=-16.5, y=26.5)\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(x=1.5, y=3.0)\nConsists of following entities\n-  Boiler at position(x=1.5, y=3.0) \n-  Pipe at position(x=1.5, y=2.5) and pipe at position(x=2.5, y=2.5)\n\n### Offshore pump at position(x=-16.5, y=26.5)\nConsists of offshore pump at position(x=-16.5, y=26.5) and pipe at position(x=-16.5, y=25.5)\n\n### Pipe network at position(x=1.5, y=-6.5)\nConsists of pipe group with fluid system 233808, and multiple pipes including (x=1.5,y=-6.5),(x=2.5,y=-6.5),(x=3.5,y=-6.5)\n\n### Pipe network at position(x=3.5, y=-2.5)\nConsists of pipe group with fluid system 233818, and multiple pipes including (x=3.5,y=-2.5),(x=5.5,y=-2.5),(x=4.5,y=-2.5)\n\n### Pipe network at position(x=-16.5, y=25.5)\nConsists of pipe group with fluid system 233855, and multiple pipes including (x=-16.5,y=25.5),(x=-15.5,y=25.5)\n\n### Electricity network at position(x=7.5, y=2.5)\nConsists of electricity group with id 23905, and multiple poles including (x=7.5,y=2.5),(x=7.5,y=-0.5),(x=7.5,y=0.5),(x=3.5,y=2.5),(x=3.5,y=0.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n### Errors when placing entities at a distance\n-  Make sure to move to the target entity position before placing entities. The maximum distance to place an entity is 10 units.\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied tiles\n-  Ensure the target position is not occupied by another entity or water before attempting to place an entity. \n-  Check for any warnings or errors that may indicate the entity cannot be placed at the target position. \n### Errors when using API to place entities\n-  Verify the API call is correct and the entity prototype exists before attempting to place an entity. \n-  Check the entity's properties, such as direction and position, to ensure they are valid and match the game's requirements."}
