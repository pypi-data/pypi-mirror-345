{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Furnace at position(0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position (0, 0)) with fuel (coal) and currently producing copper plates. The furnace has a status of NO_INGREDIENTS due to lack of required ingredients for smelting.\n\n### Wooden Chest at position(2.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest (position (2.5, 0.5)) with an inventory containing 116 copper plates.\n\n### Copper Plate Production\nThis structure is formed by the interaction between the furnace and the wooden chest, facilitating the production and storage of copper plates.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n- **Errors when crafting items due to missing ingredients**: \n  - Ensure that the required ingredients for crafting are available in the inventory or accessible from the connected structures. The automation science pack requires copper plates, which cannot be crafted because the furnace has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n- **Errors when transferring items to a chest with insufficient inventory**: \n  - Verify that the chest has enough space to receive items before transferring them. The error message indicates that there were no copper plates available in the inventory to transfer to the chest, suggesting a need to check inventory levels before performing transfers.\n\n- **Repeated errors when crafting automation science pack**: \n  - The crafting of the automation science pack has failed multiple times due to insufficient copper plates. Ensure that the furnace is operational and has the necessary ingredients to produce copper plates before attempting to craft the automation science pack.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- **Utility Functions**: \n  - `craft_item(item)`: This function has failed multiple times due to insufficient ingredients for crafting the automation science pack.\n\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `copper-plate: int` - Current amount of copper plates in inventory.\n  - `stone-furnace: int` - Count of stone furnaces in inventory.\n  - `wood: int` - Amount of wood in inventory.\n  - `iron-plate: int` - Amount of iron plates in inventory.\n  - `automation-science-pack: int` - Count of automation science packs in inventory."}
