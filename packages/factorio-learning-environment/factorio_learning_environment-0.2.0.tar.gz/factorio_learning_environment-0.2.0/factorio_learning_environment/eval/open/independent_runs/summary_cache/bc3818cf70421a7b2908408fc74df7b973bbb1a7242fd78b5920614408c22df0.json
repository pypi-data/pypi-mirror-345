{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-12.5, 24.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (-12.5, 24.5)\n- Boiler at position (-5.5, 25.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Multiple Pipe Groups connecting the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Furnace at position (15.0, 0.0)\n- Inserters at positions (16.5, 0.5) and (17.5, 0.5)\n- Wooden Chests at positions (5.5, 0.5) and (18.5, 0.5)\n- Small Electric Pole at position (17.5, -0.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Fluid Connections\n- Ensure that all fluid connections are properly established between the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine. Check that pipes are correctly placed and connected.\n\n### Errors with Power Network Connections\n- Verify that all electric poles are correctly placed to connect the steam engine to the power network. Ensure that there are no gaps in the electric pole network.\n\n### Repeated Placement of Electric Poles\n- Avoid placing electric poles repeatedly at the same position. Confirm the placement once to ensure connectivity.\n\n### Inserter Power Issues\n- Ensure that inserters are connected to a power source. Check the electric pole network to confirm that power is being delivered to all inserters.\n\n### Offshore Pump Not Connected\n- Make sure the offshore pump is connected to the fluid network and that there is a clear path for water to flow to the boiler."}
