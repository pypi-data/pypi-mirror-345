{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report: Steps 0-55\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Basic Power Generation at x=-5.0 y=2.5\n*   **Purpose:** Generates steam from water and burns coal to produce electricity.\n*   **Components:**\n    *   Offshore Pump at `Position(x=-9.5, y=-0.5)` extracting water.\n    *   Boiler at `Position(x=-5.0, y=2.5)` consuming coal (refueled in steps 36, 40, 43, 47, 49, 55) and heating water.\n    *   Steam Engine at `Position(x=-0.5, y=2.5)` consuming steam and generating power.\n    *   Pipe Group connecting Offshore Pump to Boiler (`fluid_system=7106`).\n    *   Pipe Group connecting Boiler to Steam Engine (`fluid_system=7109`).\n    *   Connected to the main power grid (`ElectricityGroup id=91883`).\n\n### Iron Mining Setup at x=19.5 y=73.5\n*   **Purpose:** Mines Iron Ore. Smelting components were placed and then removed. Currently non-operational.\n*   **Components:**\n    *   Electric Mining Drill at `Position(x=19.5, y=73.5)` mining Iron Ore. Output is blocked.\n    *   Wooden Chest at `Position(x=20.5, y=79.5)` intended for storing Iron Plates. Currently empty.\n    *   "}
