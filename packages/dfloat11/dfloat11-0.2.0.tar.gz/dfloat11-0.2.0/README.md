**DFloat11** is a lossless compression framework that reduces the size of Large Language Models (LLMs) by approximately **30%** while preserving **bit-for-bit identical outputs** to the original model. It enables efficient GPU inference on resource-constrained hardware without sacrificing accuracy.

## 📰 News

- [05/05/2025] The `dfloat11` pip package has been upgraded to `v0.2.0`! We have made the following important changes:
  * We added support for Qwen 3, Gemma 3, and Phi 4!
  * The GPU decompression kernel is now 20-40% faster! We achieved it by improving thread occupancy and implementing tons of optimizations.
  * The DFloat11 models are now stored in safetensors format for better safety and loading performance.
  * When using a DFloat11 model, only the compressed model is downloaded, not the original model.

## 📦 Installation

Requires a CUDA-compatible GPU and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) installed.

```bash
pip install dfloat11[cuda12]
# or if you have CUDA version 11:
# pip install dfloat11[cuda11]
```

## 🔍 How It Works

DFloat11 compresses model weights using **Huffman coding** of BFloat16 exponent bits, combined with **hardware-aware algorithmic designs** that enable efficient on-the-fly decompression directly on the GPU. During inference, the weights remain compressed in GPU memory and are **decompressed just before matrix multiplications**, then **immediately discarded after use** to minimize memory footprint.

Key benefits:

* **No CPU decompression or host-device data transfer**: all operations are handled entirely on the GPU.
* **Decompression overhead is constant** per forward pass and **independent of batch size**, making DFloat11 increasingly efficient at larger batch sizes.
* DFloat11 is **much faster than CPU-offloading approaches**, enabling practical deployment in memory-constrained environments.
* At batch size = 1, inference is approximately 2× slower than the original BF16 model, but the performance gap narrows significantly with larger batches.
* The compression is **fully lossless**, guaranteeing that the model’s outputs are **bit-for-bit identical** to those of the original model.

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. Install the `dfloat11` pip package. See [Installation](#📦-installation).
2. Run the following code in Python, which automatically downloads the DFloat11 `Qwen3-8B` model and generates a response.
  ```python
  import torch
  from dfloat11 import DFloat11Model
  from transformers import AutoTokenizer

  model_id = "DFloat11/Qwen3-8B-DF11"

  model = DFloat11Model.from_pretrained(model_id, device_map="auto")

  tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)
  tokenizer.pad_token = tokenizer.eos_token

  prompt = "Question: What is a binary tree and its applications? Answer:"
  inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt", padding=True).to(model.device)

  with torch.no_grad():
      output = model.generate(
          **inputs,
          max_new_tokens=256,
          do_sample=True,
      )

  print(tokenizer.batch_decode(output, skip_special_tokens=True))
  ```
3. Replace the `model_id` in the script above with any pre-compressed model in the [Model Hub](#📚-model-hub).

## 🏎️ Benchmarking Performance

To test the speed and memory consumption a DFloat11 LLM during inference:

```bash
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python inference.py \
  --model_name_or_path DFloat11/Qwen3-8B-DF11 \
  --prompt "Question: What is a binary tree and its applications? Answer:" \
  --num_tokens 512 \
  --batch_size 1
```

> 💡 **Tip**: If you specify multiple CUDA devices (e.g., `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1`), the model will be automatically distributed across them using 🤗 Accelerate's `device_map="auto"`.

### Arguments

- `--model_name_or_path`: HuggingFace name or local path of the DFloat11 model (e.g., `DFloat11/Qwen3-8B-DF11`). See the [Model Hub](#📚-model-hub) section for a list of available DFloat11 models.
- `--bf16`: *(Optional)* Turn on this flag when passing a BFloat16 model to `--model_name_or_path`
- `--prompt`: Input prompt string for text generation
- `--num_tokens`: Number of new tokens to generate per sample
- `--batch_size`: Number of prompts to process in parallel
- `--seed`: *(Optional)* Random seed for reproducible results

### Output

The script prints:
- Generated responses
- Total decoding latency
- Tokens per second (throughput)
- GPU memory usage (allocated and peak)
