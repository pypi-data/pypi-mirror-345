Consider increasing the spacing, changing the direction, or adjusting the reference position to avoid collisions.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient inventory items\n- Verify that you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. This will prevent errors related to insufficient inventory items.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source items are available for the inserters to pick up. Regularly check and manage the inventory of source entities to keep the production line running smoothly."}
