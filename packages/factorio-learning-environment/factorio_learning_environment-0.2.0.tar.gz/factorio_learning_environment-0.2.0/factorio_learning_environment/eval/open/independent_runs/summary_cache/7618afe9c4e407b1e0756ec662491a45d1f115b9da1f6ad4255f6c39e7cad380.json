{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Smelting Area at (0,0) to (6,4)\nConsists of four furnaces:\n- Stone furnace at (0,0) - iron plate production\n- Stone furnace at (2,0) - iron plate production  \n- Stone furnace at (4,4) - iron plate production\n- Stone furnace at (6,4) - iron plate production\n\n### Copper Smelting Area at (0,4)\nConsists of two furnaces:\n- Stone furnace at (0,4) - copper plate production\n- Stone furnace at (2,4) - copper plate production\n\n### Research Lab at (8.5,0.5)\nSingle lab for automation science research, currently powered with 10 automation science packs but no power connection\n\n### Power Generation System near (-9.5,24.5)\nIncomplete power generation setup consisting of:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5,24.5)\n- Boiler at (-9.5,23.0)\n- Steam engine at (-9.5,19.5)\nComponents are placed but not properly connected with pipes and not functioning\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Errors\n- Check inventory before attempting to place entities - several errors occurred trying to place lab and offshore pump without having them in inventory\n- Ensure target location is suitable for entity placement - steam engine placement failed due to water/terrain conflicts\n\n### Crafting Dependencies \n- When crafting complex items like labs, ensure all prerequisite items and recipes are available first\n- For items requiring machine assembly (like copper plates), use appropriate production buildings rather than trying to craft directly\n\n### Power System Connection Issues\n- Power generation components (pump, boiler, steam engine) need proper pipe connections to function\n- Ensure correct positioning and spacing between power system components\n- Use appropriate pipe entities to connect water flow between offshore pump and boiler\n\n### Inventory Management\n- Monitor iron ore and copper ore levels in furnaces to maintain continuous production\n- Keep sufficient coal available for furnace operation\n\n### API Usage Errors\n- Invalid arithmetic operations with prototype attributes caused errors - ensure proper attribute access\n- Connection between entities requires valid connection methods and compatible entity types"}
