Sometimes, updates can fix bugs or issues that cause unresponsiveness.\n\n3. **Simplify Commands**: If you regain access, start with very simple commands (like checking the status of the game or querying for basic information) to see if any output is produced.\n\n4. **Consult Community Forums**: If the problem persists, consider reaching out to the Factorio community or checking forums for similar issues. Other users may have experienced the same problem and could offer solutions.\n\n5. **Documentation Review**: Review the official Factorio documentation for any notes on common issues with the REPL environment.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWithout specific commands or outputs, it is challenging to provide targeted advice or analysis. If you can share any particular commands or context, I would be more than happy to assist you further!", "summary_range": "[1-334]"}
