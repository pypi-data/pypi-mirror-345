{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Mining and Smelting Setup at (-28, -61)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-28.0, -61.0)\n- Stone furnace at (-27.0, -59.0)\n- Burner inserter at (-25.5, -58.5)\n- Wooden chest at (-24.5, -58.5) containing copper plates\n\n### Iron Mining Complex at (-10, -59)\nConsists of three mining drills in sequence:\n- Burner mining drill at (-10.0, -59.0)\n- Burner mining drill at (-8.0, -59.0)\n- Burner mining drill at (-6.0, -59.0)\nConnected by transport belts and wooden chests:\n- Wooden chest at (-9.5, -57.5)\n- Wooden chest at (-7.5, -57.5)\n- Wooden chest at (-5.5, -57.5)\nMultiple burner inserters managing material flow between components\n\n### Iron Smelting Line at (0, 0)\nFour parallel smelting units:\n1. First unit:\n   - Stone furnace at (0.0, 0.0)\n   - Input inserter at (0.5, -1.5)\n   - Output inserter at (0.5, 1.5)\n   - Storage chest at (0.5, 2.5)\n\n2. Second unit:\n   - Stone furnace at (2.0, 0.0)\n   - Input inserter at (2.5, -1.5)\n   - Output inserter at (2.5, 1.5)\n   - Storage chest at (2.5, 2.5)\n\n3. Third unit:\n   - Stone furnace at (4.0, 0.0)\n   - Input inserter at (4.5, -1.5)\n   - Output inserter at (4.5, 1.5)\n   - Storage chest at (4.5, 2.5)\n\n4. Fourth unit:\n   - Stone furnace at (6.0, 0.0)\n   - Input inserter at (6.5, -1.5)\n   - Output inserter at (6.5, 1.5)\n   - Storage chest at (6.5, 2.5)\n\n### Transport Belt Network\nMultiple belt groups connecting various parts of the factory:\n- Belt group from (-4.5, -57.5) to (0.5, -2.5)\n- Belt group from (-9.5, -54.5) to (-7.5, -54.5)\n- Belt group from (-6.5, -54.5) to (-4.5, -54.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Conflicts\n- Check for existing entities before placing new ones\n- When placing inserters next to entities, ensure the target position is not already occupied\n- Consider using different spacing or direction if initial placement fails\n\n### Inserter Configuration Issues\n- Multiple inserters are waiting for source items - ensure proper material flow to input\n- Some inserters are blocked by items on ground - verify proper output paths and storage availability\n- For furnace setups, ensure both input and output paths are clear and properly configured\n\n### Resource Flow Problems\n- Several furnaces show \"no ingredients to smelt\" - verify proper input material delivery\n- Some mining drills show \"output blocked\" warnings - ensure proper output collection setup"}
