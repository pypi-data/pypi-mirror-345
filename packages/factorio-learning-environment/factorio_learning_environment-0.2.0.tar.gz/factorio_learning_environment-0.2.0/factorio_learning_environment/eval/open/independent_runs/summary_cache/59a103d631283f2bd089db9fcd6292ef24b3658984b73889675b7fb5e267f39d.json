{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at Position (-1.5, 24.5) \n- Boiler at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting these entities with positions including (-8.5, 23.5), (-9.5, 23.5), (-7.5, 23.5), (-7.5, 24.5), and (1.5, 24.5)\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at Position (9.0, -64.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n\n### Iron Plate Mine at Position (6.0, -62.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) not receiving electricity\n- Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5) and another at Position (6.5, -59.5) containing iron plates\n\n### Lab at Position (N/A)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab with automation science pack input, not receiving power\n\n### Pipe Network\n- PipeGroup with fluid system 5526, status EMPTY, at Position (-1.5, 11.5)\n- PipeGroup with fluid system 5538, status FULL OUTPUT, at Position (-8.5, 23.5)\n- PipeGroup with fluid system 5541, status EMPTY, at Position (1.5, 22.5)\n- PipeGroup with fluid system 5544, status EMPTY, at Position (-4.5, 26.5)\n\n### Electricity Network\n- ElectricityGroup with ID 79022, voltage 0, connecting various small electric poles\n- ElectricityGroup with ID 79032, voltage 0, connecting various small electric poles\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure there are no obstructions in the path before attempting to connect pipes. Clear any blocking entities to establish a successful connection.\n\n### Errors when Generating Power\n- Verify that the steam engine is properly connected to the boiler and receiving steam. Ensure there are no blockages or disconnections in the fluid network.\n- Check that the steam engine is connected to the power network and receiving necessary inputs to generate power.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Not Receiving Power\n- Confirm that inserters are connected to a powered electric pole. Ensure the electricity network is operational and supplying power to connected entities.\n\n### Errors with Lab Not Receiving Power\n- Make sure the lab is connected to a functioning power network. Check the connections and ensure the electricity network is active and supplying power."}
