{"content": "## Report\n\n### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (61.0, -54.0)\nThis facility is responsible for producing iron plates from iron ore using a stone furnace. It consists of:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (61.0, -54.0) which processes iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (61.5, -52.5) used for storing coal.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (62.5, -53.5) used for storing coal.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (62.5, -52.5) used for storing coal.\n\n#### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nThis facility is responsible for mining coal and storing it in chests. It consists of:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (41.0, -82.0) which extracts coal.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (41.5, -83.5) which transfers coal from the mining drill to the chests.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (40.5, -83.5) used for storing coal.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (42.5, -83.5) used for storing coal.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entity for the inserter has items available for pickup. If the inserter is waiting, check the supply line to ensure there are no blockages or shortages.\n\n#### Furnace Result is Full\n- Regularly extract items from the furnace to prevent it from becoming full and halting production. Consider using inserters to automate the extraction process.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n#### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined by the agent in the given steps.\n\n#### Important Variables\n- `furnace_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the inventory of the stone furnace.\n- `current_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the agent's current inventory.\n- `entities_on_map`: List[Entity] - Stores the entities present on the map."}
