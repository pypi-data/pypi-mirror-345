{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnaces**: \n  - Stone Furnace at position (x=-16.0, y=-49.0) with fuel (coal) and iron ore input, producing iron plates.\n  - Stone Furnace at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0) with fuel (coal) and iron ore input, producing iron plates.\n\n- **Inserters**:\n  - Burner Inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-47.5) with pickup position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) and drop position (x=-13.5, y=-46.5), supplying iron ore to the furnace at (x=-14.0, y=-49.0).\n  - Burner Inserter at position (x=-14.5, y=-45.5) with pickup position (x=-14.5, y=-46.5) and drop position (x=-14.5, y=-44.5), moving items along the belt.\n  - Burner Inserter at position (x=-9.5, y=-44.5) with pickup position (x=-8.5, y=-44.5) and drop position (x=-10.5, y=-44.5), interacting with the belt system.\n\n- **Belts**:\n  - Belt at position (x=-16.5, y=-47.5) outputting towards (x=-16.5, y=-46.5).\n  - Belt at position (x=-14.5, y=-46.5) outputting towards (x=-14.5, y=-47.5).\n  - Belt at position (x=-12.5, y=-46.5) outputting towards (x=-11.5, y=-46.5).\n  - BeltGroup connecting various positions for transporting items between entities.\n\n- **Chests**:\n  - Wooden Chest at position (x=-13.5, y=-46.5) for storing items.\n  - Iron Chest at position (x=-11.5, y=-44.5) for storing items.\n\n### Transport System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Belts**:\n  - Multiple belts interconnecting the furnaces, inserters, and chests to facilitate the movement of materials and products.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items without sufficient inventory\n- Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. This will prevent errors related to missing items during operations.\n\n### Errors when using inserters waiting for source items\n- Check that the source entity has items available for the inserter to pick up. If the inserter is waiting for source items, verify the supply chain and ensure that items are being delivered to the source entity."}
