{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nNo structures have been successfully created on the map. All attempts to place entities have failed, resulting in an empty map with no entities present.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure the target tile is unoccupied and suitable for placement before attempting to place an entity. Multiple attempts to place entities such as wooden chests, stone furnaces, ore inserters, plate inserters, and output chests have failed due to placement issues.\n\n### Errors related to pathfinding\n- Verify the pathfinding logic to ensure the agent can successfully move to the desired position. Errors occurred when attempting to move to new positions, indicating issues with path requests.\n\n### Errors due to incorrect data handling\n- Ensure correct data types are used when handling positions and indices. Errors such as \"string indices must be integers\" suggest issues with data handling in movement or placement logic.\n\n### Errors with movement logic\n- Confirm that the agent's movement logic is functioning correctly to avoid errors when moving to starting or buildable positions. Errors were encountered during movement attempts, which may indicate logic flaws or incorrect assumptions about current positions."}
