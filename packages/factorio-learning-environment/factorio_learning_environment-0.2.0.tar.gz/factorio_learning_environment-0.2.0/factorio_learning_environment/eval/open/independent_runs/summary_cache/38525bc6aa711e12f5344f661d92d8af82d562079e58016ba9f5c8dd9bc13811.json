{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Transport System at Position (x=41.0, y=-82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0) with a warning of being out of fuel.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=40.5, y=-83.5) connected to the mining drill.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=41.5, y=-83.5) waiting for source items, transferring coal from the chest at (x=40.5, y=-83.5) to another chest at (x=42.5, y=-83.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=42.5, y=-83.5) containing 229 units of coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=41.5, y=-80.5) waiting for source items, transferring coal to a chest at (x=41.5, y=-79.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=41.5, y=-79.5) containing 171 units of coal.\n- BeltGroup connecting the chest at (x=42.5, y=-83.5) to another position, facilitating coal transport.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with a warning of no ingredients to smelt, producing 72 iron plates.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=2.0, y=0.0) with a warning of no ingredients to smelt, producing 86 iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Lack of Fuel\n- Ensure that all burner mining drills and inserters have sufficient fuel to operate. Regularly check and refuel them to prevent operation halts.\n\n### Errors due to Missing Ingredients\n- Verify that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Ensure a consistent supply of raw materials to maintain production efficiency.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Check that the source entities for inserters have items available for transfer. Adjust the supply chain to ensure continuous flow of materials.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
