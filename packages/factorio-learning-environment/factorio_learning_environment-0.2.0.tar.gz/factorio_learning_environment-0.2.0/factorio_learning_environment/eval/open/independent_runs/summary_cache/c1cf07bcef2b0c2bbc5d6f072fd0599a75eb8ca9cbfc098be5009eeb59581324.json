{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Fuel: 2 units of coal\n  - Warnings: Output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Drop Position: (x=-16.5, y=-52.5)\n  - Resources: 40,000 units of iron ore\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)\n  - Status: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Fuel: 14 units of coal\n  - Furnace Result: 60 iron plates\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure the target location for placing entities such as Wooden Chests, Burner Inserters, and Transport Belts is not occupied by another entity or obstructed. Verify the placement area is clear before attempting to place these entities.\n\n### Errors when moving entities\n- Verify that the destination location for moving entities like Stone Furnaces is valid and unoccupied. Ensure the target position is suitable for the entity being moved.\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities\n- When attempting to retrieve entities using API calls, ensure the entity exists at the specified position. Double-check the coordinates to confirm the presence of the entity before making the API call.\n\n### Errors due to blocked outputs\n- Ensure that the output of entities like Burner Mining Drills is not blocked. Place a suitable sink entity (e.g., a chest or conveyor belt) to accept the output and prevent blockage.\n\n### Errors due to missing ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Regularly check and supply the required resources to maintain continuous production."}
