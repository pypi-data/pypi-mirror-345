{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Ore Collection and Storage at Position (-23.0, -68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) with no fuel, connected to wooden chests at positions (-23.5, -69.5) and (-24.5, -67.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (-23.5, -69.5) storing copper ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-24.5, -67.5) storing iron ore.\n\n### Iron Ore Collection and Processing at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) with no fuel, connected to wooden chests at positions (-14.5, -54.5) and (-12.5, -54.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -54.5) storing iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-12.5, -54.5) storing iron ore and copper plate.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5) waiting for source items, connected to the above chests and the mining drill.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage at Position (-16.5, -64.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (-16.5, -64.5) storing iron ore and iron plate.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-15.5, -64.5) waiting for source items, connected to chests at positions (-16.5, -64.5) and (-14.5, -64.5).\n\n### Coal Collection and Storage at Position (52.5, -84.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) with fuel, connected to wooden chests at positions (52.5, -84.5) and (54.5, -84.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5) storing coal and copper ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (54.5, -84.5) storing coal.\n\n### Copper Plate Production at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with fuel, producing copper plates.\n- Stone Furnace at position (5.0, 0.0) with fuel, producing copper plates.\n\n### Belt System for Material Transport\nConsists of the following entities:\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (1.5, 1.5) to (3.5, 1.5) and (2.5, 1.5) to (4.5, 1.5).\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (3.5, 2.5) to (5.5, 2.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### TypeError: 'Chest' object is not callable\n- Ensure that you are using the correct method to interact with chest entities. Chests are objects and cannot be called like functions. Use appropriate methods to access or modify their contents.\n\n### Errors when using inserters waiting for source items\n- Verify that the inserters have access to source items. Ensure that the source chests or belts have items available for the inserters to pick up.\n\n### Errors due to full chests\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are full to prevent mining drills and other entities from halting operations due to lack of space.\n\n### Errors due to lack of fuel in mining drills\n- Ensure that mining drills are regularly refueled to maintain continuous operation. Check fuel levels and replenish as needed."}
