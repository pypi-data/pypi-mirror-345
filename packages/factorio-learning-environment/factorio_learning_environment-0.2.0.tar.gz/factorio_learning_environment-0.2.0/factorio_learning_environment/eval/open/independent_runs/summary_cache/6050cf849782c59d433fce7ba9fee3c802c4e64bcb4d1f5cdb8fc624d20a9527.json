{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) mining iron ore. It is currently out of fuel and has its output blocked by an item on the ground.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) connected to the mining drill, intended to collect mined iron ore.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-10.0, y=-50.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates. It is currently out of fuel and lacks ingredients to smelt.\n- **Burner Inserters**:\n  - At position (x=-15.5, y=-53.5), (x=-13.5, y=-52.5), and (x=-9.5, y=-48.5), all waiting for source items and out of fuel. They are intended to move items between the mining drill, chest, and furnace.\n\n### Transport Belt System\n- **BeltGroup**: \n  - Inputs from position (x=-16.5, y=-54.5) to (x=-14.5, y=-54.5), direction RIGHT.\n  - Outputs from position (x=-12.5, y=-54.5) to (x=-10.5, y=-54.5), direction RIGHT.\n  - Consists of 5 belts, currently empty.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Placement Errors\n- **Failed to find a suitable position for the wooden chest**: Ensure there is enough space and no obstructions at the intended placement location for the wooden chest.\n\n### Resource Supply Errors\n- **Iron ore is not reaching the chest**: Check the connectivity and alignment of the transport belts and inserters to ensure iron ore is being transported correctly from the mining drill to the chest.\n- **No iron ore available to supply to the furnace**: Verify that the mining drill is operational and that there is a clear path for iron ore to reach the furnace.\n\n### Inventory and Fuel Management\n- **Could not insert: No coal to insert from your inventory**: Regularly check and maintain sufficient coal supply in your inventory to refuel entities like mining drills and inserters.\n\n### API Usage Errors\n- **Error when inspecting inventory of wooden chest**: Ensure that the coordinates provided for inspecting the inventory of an entity are correct and that the entity exists at those coordinates.\n- **Error when picking up an entity**: When using the `pickup_entity` function, ensure the second argument is a valid Position object.\n\nBy addressing these issues, the efficiency and productivity of the operations can be significantly improved."}
