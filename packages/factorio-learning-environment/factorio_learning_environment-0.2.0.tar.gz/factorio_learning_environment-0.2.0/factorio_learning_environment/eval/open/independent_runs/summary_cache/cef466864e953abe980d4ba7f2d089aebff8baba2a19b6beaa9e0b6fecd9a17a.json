{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report - Steps 0-71\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generation at Position(x=-9.5, y=-0.5) to (x=0.5, y=6.5)\nThis structure generates electricity using steam power. It is currently not operational as the boiler is out of fuel and the steam engine reports no fluid input and is not connected to the power network.\n*   **Offshore Pump** at Position(x=-9.5, y=-0.5): Extracts water. Status: `WORKING`.\n*   **Pipe Group** from Position(x=-8.5, y=-0.5) to Position(x=-4.5, y=0.5): Transports water to the boiler. Status: `FULL_OUTPUT`. Contains 6 pipes.\n*   **Boiler** at Position(x=-5.0, y=2.5): Heats water into steam using coal. Status: `NO_FUEL`. Steam output at Position(x=-6.5, y=2.5).\n*   **Pipe Group** from Position(x=-6.5, y=2.5) to Position(x=-2.5, y=6.5): Intended to transport steam to the steam engine. Status: `EMPTY`. Contains multiple pipes.\n*   **Steam Engine** at Position(x=0.5, y=6.5): Intended to generate power from steam. Status: `NOT_CONNECTED`, `NO_INPUT_LIQUID`.\n\n### Coal Mining Setup at Position(x=17.5, y=1.5) to (x=17.5, y=7.5)\nExtracts coal and places it into a chest via an inserter chain. Currently inactive due to lack of power.\n*   **Electric Mining Drill** at Position(x=17.5, y=1.5): Mines coal. Status: `NO_POWER`. Drops coal at Position(x=17.5, y=3.5).\n*   **Wooden Chest** at Position(x=17.5, y=3.5): Intermediate storage for coal.\n*   **Burner Inserter** at Position(x=17.5, y=4.5): Moves coal from chest at (17.5, 3.5) to chest at (17.5, 5.5). Status: `WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS`.\n*   **Wooden Chest** at Position(x=17.5, y=5.5): Intermediate storage for coal.\n*   **Burner Inserter** at Position(x=17.5, y=6.5): Moves coal from chest at (17.5, 5.5"}
