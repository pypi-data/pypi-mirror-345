{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Furnace at position (1.0, 1.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace (position (1.0, 1.0)) with coal count: 0 and iron ore count: 9.\n\n### Wooden chest at position (3.5, 1.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest (position (3.5, 1.5)) with inventory: {'iron-plate': 50}.\n\n### Wooden chest at position (3.5, 3.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest (position (3.5, 3.5)) with inventory: {'iron-plate': 50}.\n\n### Wooden chest at position (3.5, 5.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest (position (3.5, 5.5)) with empty inventory.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when crafting items\n- Ensure that the required technology is researched before attempting to craft items that depend on it. For example, the recipe for steel-chest requires steel-processing technology.\n- Make sure you have enough of the required sub-ingredients before crafting an item. For example, crafting a wooden chest requires wood, which must be gathered first.\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure you are within the maximum distance to place an entity. If the target position is too far away, move closer before attempting to place the entity.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into entities\n- Ensure that the target entity has enough capacity to receive the items you are trying to insert. For example, if a furnace is out of fuel or ingredients, it may not accept additional items."}
