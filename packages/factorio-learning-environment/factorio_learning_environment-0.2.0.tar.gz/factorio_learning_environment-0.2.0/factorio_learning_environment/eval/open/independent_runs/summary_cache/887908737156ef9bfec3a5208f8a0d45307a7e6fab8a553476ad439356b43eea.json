{"content": "Here is the updated report:\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Partial Power Plant at (100,100) (New)\n- **Boiler** at (103.0, 100.5) - Steam production (fueled with coal)\n- **Steam engine** at (106.5, 100.5) - Power generation (unconnected)\n- **Stone furnace** at (100.0, 100.0) - Smelting (inactive, no ingredients)\n\n### Previous Structures (Cleared)\n- All previous builds at (200,200) and (300,300) were cleared during steps 96-103\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Placement Collisions (Critical)\n- 40+ failed placement attempts due to:\n  1. Not clearing existing objects before rebuilds\n  2. Attempting to place over existing entities\n  3. Building too far from player position\n- Required solutions:\n  1. Implement systematic cleanup before new builds\n  2. Use get_colliding_entities() pre-check\n  3. Maintain build area tracking\n  4. Verify player proximity (<10 tiles)\n\n### Power System Design (Persistent)\n- Continued connection failures in new builds\n- Critical issues:\n  1. Missing pipe connections (ValueError for Direction)\n  2. Unconnected boiler-steam engine pair\n  3. Incorrect pipe placement coordinates\n- Design requirements:\n  1. Complete fluid connections before power\n  2. Verify all connection points\n  3. Use proper Direction parameters\n\n### Resource Management (New)\n- Multiple crafting/smelting failures due to:\n  1. Missing copper ore for smelting\n  2. Attempting to insert non-existent items\n  3. Not mining required resources first\n- Required fixes:\n  1. Verify inventory before insertion\n  2. Implement resource gathering protocol\n  3. Maintain minimum resource buffers\n\n### Position Validation (Ongoing)\n- Continued placement failures at occupied/distant positions\n- Required improvements:\n  1. Implement position validation wrapper\n  2. Use integer grid coordinates\n  3. Maintain build area map\n  4. Track player position during builds\n\n### Previous Unresolved Issues\n- Power plant not fully connected\n- Furnace inactive due to missing inputs\n- No functional production lines\n- Assembler placement failures persist\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Defined Functions\n- `find_clear_land_near_power()` -> Position\n  - Still unused due to placement issues\n  - Needs collision detection implementation\n\n### Important Variables\n- `boiler`: Primary steam producer at (103.0, 100.5)\n- `steam_engine`: Unconnected generator at (106.5, 100.5)\n- `furnace`: Inactive smelter at (100.0, 100.0)"}
