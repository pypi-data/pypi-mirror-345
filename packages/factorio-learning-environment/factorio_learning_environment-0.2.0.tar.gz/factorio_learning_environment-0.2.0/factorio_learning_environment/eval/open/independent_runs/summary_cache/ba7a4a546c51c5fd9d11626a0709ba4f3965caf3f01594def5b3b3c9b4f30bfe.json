{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=1.5, y=23.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the boiler and steam engine, including:\n  - Pipe at position (x=3.5, y=17.5)\n  - Pipe at position (x=-9.5, y=23.5)\n  - PipeGroup with fluid system 60524, positions ranging from (x=3.5, y=17.5) to (x=10.5, y=21.5)\n  - PipeGroup with fluid system 60535, positions ranging from (x=-9.5, y=23.5) to (x=-0.5, y=23.5)\n\n### Electricity Network\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at various positions including (x=3.5, y=20.5), (x=14.5, y=20.5), (x=35.5, y=20.5), and others, maintaining voltage distribution.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors when connecting pipes\n- Ensure that the entities you are trying to connect are compatible and that there is a clear path for the connection. For instance, the error in step 2016 indicates a failed attempt to connect pipes to a steam engine due to incompatible or misaligned positions.\n\n### Attribute Errors in Code\n- Verify the attributes and methods you are calling on objects. For example, in step 2024, the error suggests using 'PipeGroup' instead of 'PipeToGround'. Double-check the API documentation for correct usage."}
