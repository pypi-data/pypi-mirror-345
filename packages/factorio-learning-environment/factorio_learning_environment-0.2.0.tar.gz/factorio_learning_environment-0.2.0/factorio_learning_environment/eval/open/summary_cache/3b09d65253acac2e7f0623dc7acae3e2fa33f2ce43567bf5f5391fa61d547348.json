{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron ore mining and smelting structure at position around (17.5, 72.5)\nConsists of the following connected entities:\n- Electric mining drill at position (17.5, 72.5) facing down, powered but output blocked due to furnace belt blockage.\n- Stone furnace at position (18.0, 75.0) fueled with coal, operational but frequently full output inventory.\n- Three wooden chests at positions (19.5, 75.5), (21.5, 75.5), and (21.5, 77.5) serving as storage for smelted iron plates.\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5) and (20.5, 77.5) fueled and operational, feeding the chests.\n- Small electric pole at (15.5, 75.5) connected to power network.\n- Output blockage at furnace belt remains unresolved, causing mining drill output issues.\n\nThis structure enables iron ore extraction, smelting, and staged storage of iron plates with sustained power and inserter fueling.\n\n### Steam power generation structure at position around (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, -0.5) extracting water.\n- Boiler at (-5.0, 2.5) fueled with coal, operational.\n- Steam engine at (0.5, 6.5) connected by pipes, generating power.\n- Small electric poles at (-4.5, -0.5), (0.5, 3.5), (0.5, 6.5), and newly placed poles at (17.5, 72.5) and (25.5, 80.5) forming a connected power network.\n\nThis structure reliably generates steam power to supply electricity for the factory.\n\n### Iron gear wheel assembly structure at position around (25.5, 80.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine 2 at (25.5, 80.5) connected to power network, now receiving iron plates directly inserted.\n- Input wooden chest at (21.5, 75.5) feeding iron plates into assembly area.\n- Output wooden chest at (25.5, 82.5) with burner inserter at (25.5, 83.5) fueled and operational, moving assembled items into output chest.\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 77.5) and (25.5, 83.5) fueled and operational.\n- Assembling machine intermittently reports shortage of iron plates preventing crafting, despite iron plates being inserted; output chest remains empty indicating output items not extracted.\n\nThis structure is intended for iron gear wheel production, now powered and supplied with iron plates but output extraction remains an issue.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity placement conflicts due to occupied tiles\n- Persistent failure to place small electric pole near furnace at (18.0, 75.0) due to collision with mining drill at (17.5, 72.5) and water tiles.\n- To avoid these errors, verify tile occupancy and environmental constraints before placement; consider increasing spacing, changing placement direction, or selecting alternative reference positions.\n\n### Inserter inventory and fuel management\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5), (20.5, 77.5), and (25.5, 83.5) consistently fueled and operational.\n- Some inserters report waiting for source items due to empty input chests, indicating intermittent supply issues.\n- Maintain steady input inventories and monitor inserter fuel to prevent stoppages.\n\n### Crafting and recipe dependency errors\n- Assembling machine at (25.5, 80.5) intermittently unable to craft iron gear wheels due to missing iron plates, despite iron plates being inserted.\n- Input and output inventories of assembling machine sometimes empty or holding unextracted items.\n- Output chest at (25.5, 82.5) remains empty, suggesting output items are not being extracted by inserters.\n- Ensure continuous supply of iron plates and verify output inserters are correctly extracting crafted items to output chests.\n\n### Output blockage and power connectivity warnings\n- Mining drill at (17.5, 72.5) continues to report \"furnace belt at drop position is blocked,\" causing output blockage.\n- Furnace output inventory frequently full, preventing further smelting.\n- Power network improved with additional poles placed at (17.5, 72.5) and (25.5, 80.5).\n- To resolve output blockage, clear or extend output belts and chests to accept items; verify inserters and belts downstream are not jammed.\n\n### Item extraction errors from chests\n- Extraction attempts from wooden chest at (21.5, 75.5) failed due to chest being empty or no valid chest found.\n- To avoid extraction errors, confirm"}
