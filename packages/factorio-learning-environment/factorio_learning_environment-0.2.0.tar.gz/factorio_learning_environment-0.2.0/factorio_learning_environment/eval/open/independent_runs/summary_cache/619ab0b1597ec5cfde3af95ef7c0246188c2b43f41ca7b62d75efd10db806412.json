{"content": "I'll create a new report based on the execution logs provided:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Operation at (-15, -50)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-15, -50) facing right\n- Wooden chest at (-13.5, -50.5)\n- Burner inserter at (-14.5, -51.5) facing left\n- Burner inserter at (-12.5, -50.5) facing right\n- Connected to transport belt system\n\n### Coal Mining Operation at (38, -83)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (38, -83) facing right\n- Wooden chest at (39.5, -83.5)\n- Burner inserter at (40.5, -83.5) facing right\n- Connected to transport belt system\n\n### Smelting Complex at (45, -80)\nConsists of:\n- Two stone furnaces at (45, -80) and (47, -80)\n- Two burner inserters at (44.5, -82.5) and (46.5, -82.5) facing down\n- Two output chests:\n  - Chest at (49.5, -80.5) containing coal\n  - Chest at (49.5, -79.5) containing coal and iron plates\n- Complex belt system connecting mining operations to furnaces\n\n### Transport System\nMultiple belt groups connecting the mining operations to the smelting complex:\n- Main belt line running from (-11.5, -50.5) to (48.5, -83.5)\n- Secondary belt lines for material distribution\n- Multiple inserters managing material transfer between belts and structures\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Conflicts\n- Before placing inserters or other entities, verify the target location is clear of other entities\n- Pay attention to entity dimensions when planning placement - some entities like mining drills take up more than one tile\n- Consider the spacing requirements between inserters and their target entities\n\n### Entity Configuration Issues\n- Ensure inserters are properly rotated to face their pickup and drop locations\n- Verify belt directions align with intended material flow\n- Check that inserters have appropriate fuel before expecting them to operate\n\n### Resource Management\n- Monitor fuel levels in burner mining drills to prevent work stoppage\n- Keep track of chest capacities to prevent overflow\n- Ensure proper material flow through the transport system\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nImportant Variables:\n- `input_inserter1`, `input_inserter2`: BurnerInserter type\n- `output_inserter1`: BurnerInserter type\n\nFunctions Attempted:\n- `place_entity()`: Used for entity placement, fails when target location is occupied\n- `clear_old_inserters()`: Successfully removes existing inserters\n- `rotate_belt()`: Successfully changes belt direction\n\nThe system shows multiple attempts at placing and configuring inserters with different strategies, with some successful configurations achieved through position adjustments and proper rotation settings."}
