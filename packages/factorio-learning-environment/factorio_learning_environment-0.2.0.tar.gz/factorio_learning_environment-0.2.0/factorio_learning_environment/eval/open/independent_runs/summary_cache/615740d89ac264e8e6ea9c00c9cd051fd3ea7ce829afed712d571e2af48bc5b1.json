{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(0.5, 6.0)\nConsists of boiler (position 0.5, 6.0) and steam engine (position 0.5, 0.5). The boiler is designed to heat water and produce steam, which powers the steam engine to generate electricity.\n\n### Copper plate factory at position(-5.0, -65.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position -5.0, -65.0) that processes iron ore into iron plates.\n- Pipe groups (positions -2.5, 3.5 and 0.5, 3.5) for fluid transport.\n- The factory is connected to a power network and is responsible for producing copper plates from the processed iron.\n\n### Coal extraction setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 47.0, -82.0) that extracts coal from the ground.\n- Wooden chests (positions 46.5, -83.5 and 48.5, -83.5) for storing extracted coal.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting Boiler and Steam Engine\n- Ensure you have enough pipes to connect the Boiler and Steam Engine. Check your inventory and gather more pipes if necessary.\n\n### Errors when placing Offshore Pump\n- Cannot place Offshore Pump as it is not in inventory. Make sure to have the Offshore Pump in your inventory before attempting to place it.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing. Check for any existing entities that might block placement."}
