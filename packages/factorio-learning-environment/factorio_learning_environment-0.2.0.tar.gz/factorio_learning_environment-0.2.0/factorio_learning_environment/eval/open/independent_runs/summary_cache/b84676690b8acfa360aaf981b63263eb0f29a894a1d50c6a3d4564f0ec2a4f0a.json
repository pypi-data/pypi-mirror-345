{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Automation Science Pack Production Setup\nConsists of following entities:\n- Assembling machine at position(x=8.5, y=13.5)\n- Iron gear input system:\n  - Burner inserter at position(x=8.5, y=11.5)\n  - Wooden chest at position(x=8.5, y=10.5)\n- Copper plate input system:\n  - Burner inserter at position(x=6.5, y=13.5)\n  - Wooden chest at position(x=6.5, y=14.5)\n- Output system:\n  - Burner inserter at position(x=10.5, y=13.5)\n  - Wooden chest at position(x=11.5, y=13.5)\n\n### Mining and Smelting Operations\nMultiple mining and smelting setups:\n1. First setup:\n   - Burner mining drill at position(x=41.0, y=-82.0)\n   - Wooden chest at position(x=41.5, y=-80.5)\n   - Burner inserter at position(x=41.5, y=-79.5)\n\n2. Second setup:\n   - Burner mining drill at position(x=-28.0, y=-61.0)\n   - Wooden chest at position(x=-27.5, y=-59.5)\n   - Burner inserter at position(x=-26.5, y=-59.5)\n   - Stone furnace at position(x=-25.0, y=-59.0)\n   - Output inserter at position(x=-23.5, y=-58.5)\n   - Output chest at position(x=-22.5, y=-58.5)\n\n3. Third setup:\n   - Burner mining drill at position(x=-18.0, y=-53.0)\n   - Wooden chest at position(x=-17.5, y=-51.5)\n   - Burner inserter at position(x=-16.5, y=-51.5)\n   - Stone furnace at position(x=-15.0, y=-51.0)\n   - Output inserter at position(x=-13.5, y=-50.5)\n   - Output chest at position(x=-12.5, y=-50.5)\n\n### Power Generation System\n- Steam engine at position(x=-4.5, y=12.5)\n- Boiler at position(x=-4.5, y=16.0)\n- Offshore pump at position(x=-3.5, y=27.5)\n- Connected by multiple pipe groups and electricity poles\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Conflicts\n- Check for existing entities before placing new ones at a position\n- When placing entities next to each other, ensure proper spacing and direction to avoid conflicts with:\n  - Transport belts\n  - Electric poles\n  - Existing inserters\n\n### Resource Management\n- Ensure required items are in inventory before attempting to insert them into chests\n- Verify fuel availability for burner entities\n- Check for required ingredients before starting production\n\n### Power System Issues\n- Ensure proper connections between power generating entities and consumers\n- Verify fluid connections for steam engine and boiler setup\n\n### Production Setup\n- When setting up automation, ensure all input and output systems are properly positioned and connected\n- Verify chest placements have adequate space for inserter access\n- Consider the entire production chain layout before placing individual components"}
