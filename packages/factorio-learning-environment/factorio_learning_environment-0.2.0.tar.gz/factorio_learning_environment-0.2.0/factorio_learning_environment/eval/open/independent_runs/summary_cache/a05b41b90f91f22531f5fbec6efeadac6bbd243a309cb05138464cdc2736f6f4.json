{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-15.5, -48.5) and (-14.5, -48.5) for storing extracted materials.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5) transferring items from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-14.5, -47.5) transferring items between chests.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -46.5) for storing processed materials.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-6.5, -48.5) storing iron plates.\n\n### Secondary Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-10.0, -48.0) for additional smelting capacity.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-8.5, -47.5) waiting for source items to transfer.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-6.5, -47.5) storing iron plates.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-7.5, -47.5) for additional storage.\n\n### Inserter Setup\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-11.5, -45.5) waiting for source items to transfer.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using undefined entities\n- Ensure that all entities referenced in the code are defined and placed on the map. For example, the error \"Could not find entity at x=-11.5 y=-44.5: name 'Chest' is not defined\" suggests that a chest was expected but not present.\n\n### Errors with inventory management\n- Ensure that inventories are not full before attempting to insert items. The error \"Could not insert: Failed to insert iron-plate into stone-furnace... Inventory is full\" indicates that the furnace's output inventory was full.\n\n### Errors with variable scope\n- Ensure that all variables are properly initialized and accessible within their intended scope. The error \"UnboundLocalError: cannot access local variable 'x' where it is not associated with a value\" suggests that a variable was used before being properly defined.\n\n### Errors with inserters waiting for source items\n- Ensure that the source items are available for inserters to function. The repeated message \"Inserter at x=-11.5 y=-45.5 is waiting for source items\" indicates a lack of source items for the inserter to transfer.\n\n### Errors with resource availability\n- Ensure that there are sufficient resources available for operations. The message \"No iron ore available in ore chest for transfer\" indicates that the expected resources were not available for processing."}
