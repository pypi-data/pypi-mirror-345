{"content": "I see the pattern now - we need to check our inventory first and craft items before we can place them. Let me analyze what we've learned:\n\n1. Key Issues Identified:\n- Cannot place chests without having them in inventory first\n- Need to be within 10 units of placement location\n- Need to check what items we actually have available\n\n2. Let's check our inventory and capabilities:\n\n```python\n# First, let's see what we have to work with\ninventory = inspect_inventory(get_player())\nprint(f\"Current inventory: {inventory}\")\n\n# Check what we can craft\nrecipes = get_craftable_recipes()\nprint(f\"Craftable recipes: {recipes}\")\n\n# Check our current position\nplayer = get_player()\nprint(f\"Current position: {player.position}\")\n```\n\nThis will help us understand:\n- What items we have available\n- What we can craft\n- Where we are relative to where we need to place items\n\nWould you like me to execute this diagnostic code to better understand our current situation?", "summary_range": "[1-2666]"}
