{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-11.5, 25.0)\nConsists of boiler (position -11.5, 25.0), steam engine (position -11.5, 18.5), and offshore pump (position -9.5, 24.5). The boiler is connected to the offshore pump for water supply, and the steam engine is intended to generate electricity once connected properly.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 0, 0) and a furnace (position 0, 0)\n  \n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 5, 5) and a furnace (position 5, 5)\n- Assembling machine at position (z1) and inserter at position (a) that puts into the assembling machine\n- Beltgroup that connects the furnace at position (y1) to the assembling machine at position (z1)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting pipes\n- Ensure that the positions of the entities you are trying to connect are valid and accessible. Check for any obstacles or incorrect placements that might prevent the connection.\n  \n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors when attempting to connect steam engine to boiler\n- Verify that the steam engine and boiler are correctly positioned and that there are no missing connections. Ensure that the boiler has a water source connected before attempting to connect the steam engine."}
