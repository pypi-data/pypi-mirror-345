{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll generate a comprehensive report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Smelting Setup (around position x=42, y=-81)\nA coal mining and transport system consisting of:\n- Burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0)\n- Transport belt at (41.5, -80.5) facing RIGHT\n- Burner inserter at (42.5, -80.5) facing LEFT\n- Stone furnace at (43.0, -82.0) facing UP\n\nThe system is designed to mine coal and transport it to the furnace, with the mining drill outputting to the belt, and an inserter moving coal from the belt to the furnace.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Conflicts\n- Before placing entities, check if the target location is clear of other entities\n- Ensure the target location is on valid terrain (not water)\n- When rebuilding/repositioning entities, remove existing entities first to avoid conflicts\n\n### Transport System Issues\n- Clear blocked belts before attempting to place new items on them\n- Ensure proper alignment between mining drill output, belt position, and inserter pickup/drop positions\n- When the belt is blocked, mining operations will pause until space is available\n\n### Inserter Positioning\n- Pay attention to inserter orientation (LEFT, RIGHT, UP, DOWN) relative to source and destination\n- Verify pickup and drop positions align with belt and target entities\n- Consider the working area of nearby entities when positioning inserters\n\n### Entity Fuel Management\n- Monitor fuel levels in burner entities (mining drills, inserters, furnaces)\n- Refuel entities before they run out of energy\n- Be aware that entities may stop working if their fuel source is full\n\nNAMESPACE\n\n### Variables\n- `inserter`: BurnerInserter - Used for coal transport\n- `belt`: TransportBelt - Used for item transport\n- `furnace`: Furnace - Used for smelting operations\n- `mining_drill`: BurnerMiningDrill - Used for resource extraction\n\n### Functions\n- `place_entity()`: Places entities at specified coordinates with given orientation\n- `clear_belt()`: Removes items from transport belt\n- `refuel()`: Adds fuel to burner entities"}
