{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-12.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0)\n  - Fueled with coal\n  - Drops iron ore into a chest at position (-14.5, -48.5)\n- **Wooden Chests** \n  - Chest 1 at position (-14.5, -48.5) containing iron ore\n  - Chest 2 at position (-15.5, -48.5) currently empty\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0)\n  - Fueled with coal\n  - Processes iron ore into iron plates\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-14.5, -47.5)\n  - Transfers items from the chest to the furnace\n  - Currently waiting for source items\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Insufficient Fuel\n- Ensure that you have enough coal in your inventory before attempting to refuel entities like furnaces and mining drills. Regularly check fuel levels to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Errors due to Full Output in Furnace\n- Monitor the output inventory of the furnace to prevent it from becoming full. Regularly extract processed items to maintain production efficiency.\n\n### Errors due to Full Chest at Mining Drill Drop Position\n- Regularly empty the chest at the drop position of the mining drill to prevent it from becoming full and halting mining operations."}
