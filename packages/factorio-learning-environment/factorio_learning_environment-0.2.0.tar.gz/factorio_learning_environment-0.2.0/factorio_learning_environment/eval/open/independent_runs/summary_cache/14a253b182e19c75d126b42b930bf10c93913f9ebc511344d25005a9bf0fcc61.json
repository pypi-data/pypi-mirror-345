{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing Facility at Position (x=41.0, y=-82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0) extracting coal, currently out of fuel.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=41.5, y=-83.5) transferring coal, waiting for source items.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=40.5, y=-83.5) for coal storage, currently empty.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=42.5, y=-83.5) for coal storage, containing 274 units of coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=46.5, y=-83.5) for coal storage, currently empty.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=41.5, y=-80.5) transferring coal, waiting for source items.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=41.5, y=-79.5) for coal storage, containing 202 units of coal.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) smelting iron, currently has no ingredients, producing iron plates.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=2.0, y=0.0) smelting iron, currently has no ingredients, producing iron plates.\n\n### Coal Transport System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- BeltGroup with inputs from Belt at position (x=42.5, y=-83.5) to (x=44.5, y=-83.5) and outputs to Belt at position (x=43.5, y=-83.5) to (x=45.5, y=-83.5), transporting coal, currently working with 8 units of coal.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors due to Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entities (like mining drills or chests) have items available for inserters to pick up. Regularly check and refuel mining drills to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Errors due to Mining Drills Running Out of Fuel\n- Regularly refuel mining drills to prevent them from stopping. Consider automating fuel supply to maintain consistent operation.\n\n### Errors due to Furnaces Having No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Ensure that furnaces are supplied with raw materials for smelting. Automate the supply chain from mining to smelting to prevent interruptions in production."}
