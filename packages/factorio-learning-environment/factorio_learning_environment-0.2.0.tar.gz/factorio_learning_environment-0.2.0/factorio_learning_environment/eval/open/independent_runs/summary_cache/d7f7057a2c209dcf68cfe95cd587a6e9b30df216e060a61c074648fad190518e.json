{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll create a comprehensive report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Mining and Processing Complex at (-10, -59)\nConsists of three mining drills in a row with shared infrastructure:\n- Burner mining drills at positions (-10, -59), (-8, -59), and (-6, -59)\n- Wooden chests at (-9.5, -57.5), (-7.5, -57.5), and (-5.5, -57.5)\n- Multiple burner inserters at (-6.5, -57.5), (-7.5, -56.5), (-4.5, -57.5), (-5.5, -56.5)\n- Transport belt network connecting the components\nAll drills are operational and mining iron ore\n\n### Copper/Iron Processing Station at (-28, -61)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-28, -61)\n- Stone furnace at (-27, -59)\n- Wooden chest at (-24.5, -58.5) containing processed plates\n- Burner inserter at (-25.5, -58.5) moving items from furnace to chest\n\n### Smelting Array at (-23, -58)\nMultiple furnaces in sequence:\n- Stone furnaces at (-23, -58), (-21, -58)\n- Burner inserter at (-22.5, -56.5)\n- Wooden chest at (-22.5, -55.5) for output storage\n\n### Production Line (0, 0)\nLarge production line consisting of:\n- 4 stone furnaces at (0, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), and (6, 0)\n- Input wooden chests at (0.5, -2.5), (2.5, -2.5), (4.5, -2.5), (6.5, -2.5)\n- Output wooden chests at (0.5, 2.5), (2.5, 2.5), (4.5, 2.5), (6.5, 2.5)\n- Multiple burner inserters handling input/output operations\n- Connected by extensive belt network\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Inventory Management Errors\n- Ensure sufficient resources are in inventory before attempting to insert items into machines\n- Check coal availability before attempting to fuel machines\n\n### Entity Placement Issues\n- Multiple inserters are showing \"waiting for source items\" warnings - ensure proper item flow through the production chain\n- Some mining drills have blocked outputs - ensure proper placement of receiving entities (chests or belts)\n- Some furnaces show \"no ingredients to smelt\" - verify input logistics are properly connected and functioning\n\n### Output Blocking Issues\n- Several inserters show \"output blocked\" warnings - ensure there's sufficient space in destination containers\n- When placing output inserters, verify there's a valid destination entity within reach"}
