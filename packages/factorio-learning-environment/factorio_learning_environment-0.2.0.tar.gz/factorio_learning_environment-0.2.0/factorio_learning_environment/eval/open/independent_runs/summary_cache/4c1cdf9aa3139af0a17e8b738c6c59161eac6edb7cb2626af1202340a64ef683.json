{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(2.5, -58.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position 2.5, -58.5) and boiler (position 0.5, -62.0). The steam engine is intended to generate power, while the boiler is used to heat water to produce steam.\n\n### Lab at position(0, -60)\nConsists of a lab (position 0, -60). The lab is used for research purposes but is currently not receiving power.\n\n### Pipe network\nConsists of pipes that connect various entities for fluid transport. The pipe network is crucial for supplying water to the boiler and ensuring the steam engine operates effectively.\n\n### Copper plate factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 4.0, -62.0) and a furnace (position 4.0, -62.0). This setup is used for processing copper plates.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with steam engine not generating power\n- Ensure that the steam engine is properly connected to the boiler and that the boiler has a sufficient fuel supply to produce steam.\n\n### Errors with lab not receiving power\n- Check the connections to the lab and ensure that it is within the power network provided by the steam engine and any electric poles.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it. Check for existing entities in the target location.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items."}
