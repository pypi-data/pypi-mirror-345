{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron ore mining and smelting setup at approximately (16.0, 71.0) to (18.5, 75.5)\nConsists of the following entities arranged to mine iron ore, smelt it into iron plates, and store outputs:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (16.0, 71.0) with coal fuel, extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (16.5, 72.5) collecting iron ore from the drill.\n- Stone Furnace at position (18.0, 73.0) intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates, currently fueled with coal but lacking ore input.\n- Burner Inserter at position (16.5, 73.5) feeding iron ore from the wooden chest into the furnace.\n- Burner Inserter at position (18.5, 74.5) extracting iron plates from the furnace.\n- Wooden Chest at position (18.5, 75.5) intended to collect iron plates from the inserter.\n- Small Electric Poles nearby (positions around 17.5, 71.5 and 19.5, 73.5) providing electricity coverage.\n\nThis structure forms a basic iron ore mining and smelting line, with fuel inserted into drill, furnace, and inserters to keep them operational.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Direction argument type error when placing entities\n- When placing entities with a direction parameter, ensure the direction argument is passed as a Direction enum object, not as an integer or other type. Use the Direction enum directly (e.g., Direction.DOWN) instead of numeric values.\n\n### Connection failure between entities using connect_entities\n- Verify that both entities exist and are valid before attempting to connect them with poles or wires.\n- Check that the connection function handles nil or missing fields gracefully to avoid exceptions.\n- Ensure the entities are within valid connection range and compatible for connection.\n\n### Assertion failure due to missing chests with expected contents\n- Before asserting presence of chests containing specific items, confirm that such chests have been placed and contain the required items.\n- Implement checks to handle empty or missing inventories to avoid assertion errors.\n\n### Errors extracting items from chests due to empty inventories\n- Confirm that the target chest actually contains the item before attempting extraction.\n- Implement inventory checks and wait for production before extraction to avoid exceptions.\n\n### Inserter fuel and item insertion errors\n- Maintain sufficient coal or fuel in burner inserters to keep them operational.\n- Ensure the inventory has the required items before attempting to insert them into entities.\n- Manage inventory carefully to avoid running out of fuel or items during insertion operations.\n\n### General inventory management\n- Monitor and replenish fuel and input materials proactively to prevent stoppages.\n- Avoid attempting actions that require items not currently in inventory.\n\nOverall, careful validation of entity states, inventories, and argument types before operations will mitigate most errors encountered.\n\n"}
