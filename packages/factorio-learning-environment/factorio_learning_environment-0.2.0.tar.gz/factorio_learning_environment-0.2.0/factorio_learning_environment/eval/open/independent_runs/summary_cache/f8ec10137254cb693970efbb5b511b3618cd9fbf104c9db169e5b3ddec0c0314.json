{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nNo structures have been successfully created on the map. All attempts to place entities such as Wooden Chests, Burner Mining Drills, and Stone Furnaces have failed, resulting in no entities being present on the map.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied or invalid positions\n- Ensure the target position for placing entities like Wooden Chests, Burner Mining Drills, and Stone Furnaces is valid and unoccupied. Verify the placement conditions and clear the area if necessary before attempting to place an entity.\n\n### Errors when using incorrect API arguments\n- When using functions like `get_entities`, ensure that all arguments are correctly specified. For example, the second argument must be a Position object. Double-check the function signatures and argument types to avoid such errors."}
