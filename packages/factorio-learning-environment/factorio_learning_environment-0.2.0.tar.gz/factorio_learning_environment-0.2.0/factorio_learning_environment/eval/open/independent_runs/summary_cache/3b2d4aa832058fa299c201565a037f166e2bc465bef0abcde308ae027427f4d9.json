Monitor furnace outputs and inventory levels to meet the recipe\u2019s sub-ingredient requirements.\n\n\u2022 Pipe Inventory and Connection Validation\n  - Verify that the inventory holds the necessary quantity of Pipes prior to attempting fluid system connections. Confirm that the required number is met to link Offshore Pump to Boiler successfully.\n\n\u2022 Electrical Network Delivery for Production Facilities\n  - Double-check that production assemblers receive proper power by reviewing electric pole placements and network configurations. Adjust connections if an assembler reports NO_POWER despite an apparent link.\n\n\u2022 General Resource and Connection Verification\n  - Regularly audit inventory counts and connection statuses to preempt resource shortages and ensure that all entity links (pipe or electric) are established according to their spatial and quantity requirements."}
