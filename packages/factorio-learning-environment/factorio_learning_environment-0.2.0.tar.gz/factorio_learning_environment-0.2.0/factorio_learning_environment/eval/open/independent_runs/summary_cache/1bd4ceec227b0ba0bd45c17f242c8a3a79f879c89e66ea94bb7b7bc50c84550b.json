{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Transfer System at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) responsible for extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) used to store extracted iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -48.5) aligned to transfer iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) intended for smelting iron ore into iron plates, although currently not receiving ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Alignment and Functionality\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items from the chest to the furnace. Verify that the drop position is correctly set to the furnace input.\n\n### Errors with Entity Placement\n- When placing entities like inserters, ensure there is no collision with existing entities. Consider adjusting the spacing, changing the direction, or selecting a different reference position to avoid placement errors.\n\n### Errors with Fuel Management\n- Regularly check and refuel entities such as mining drills and inserters to prevent them from running out of fuel and stopping operations.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Operation\n- Verify that the furnace is receiving the necessary ingredients (iron ore) to function. Check the inserter setup and ensure it is correctly transferring materials to the furnace."}
