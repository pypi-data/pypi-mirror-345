{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report (Updated)\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, -0.5) (connected to pipe network)\n- Boiler at (-5.5, 0.0) (currently out of fuel and not connected)\n- Steam engine at (-1.5, 0.5) (not connected to fluid system)\n- Pipe network (fluid system 739) with pipes at (-8.5,-0.5) and (-7.5,-0.5)\n- Small electric pole at (-1.5, 2.5)\n\n### Disconnected Offshore Pump at (-11.5, 69.5)\n- Currently not connected to any fluid system\n- Warning: \"no fluid present in connections\"\n\n### Electric Mining Drill at (24.5, 16.5)\n- Still not connected to power network\n- Mining coal resource (250,000 remaining)\n- Warning: \"not connected to power network\"\n\n### Additional Pipe Networks\n- Fluid system 742 with pipes at multiple positions including (0.5,-1.5), (1.5,-1.5), (1.5,-0.5)\n- Currently empty and not connected to any production\n\n### Electricity Distribution Network (id 7226)\n- Extensive network of small electric poles spanning across the map\n- Key pole positions: (-1.5,18.5), (18.5,19.5), (-1.5,22.5), (17.5,70.5), (20.5,71.5), (23.5,70.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Persistent Placement Distance Issues (steps 32, 36, 38-39)\n- Always verify distance to target position before placement attempts:\n  - Maximum placement distance is 10 tiles from player position\n  - Calculate distance using \u221a(\u0394x\u00b2 + \u0394y\u00b2) before attempting placement\n  - Move closer before attempting to place distant entities\n\n### Repeated Collision Errors (steps 33, 35, 37)\n- Implement proper collision checking:\n  - Verify target position is clear before placing pipes or other entities\n  - Check for existing entities at (-4.5, 0.5) before attempting placement\n  - Use entity scanning functions to detect obstacles\n\n### Resource Location Errors (step 34)\n- Validate resource existence before attempting to mine:\n  - Scan area for iron ore patches before setting up mining operations\n  - Use larger search radius if initial scan fails\n  - Verify resource type matches expected type\n\n### Inventory Management Issues (steps 38-39)\n- Check inventory before placement attempts:\n  - Verify offshore pump availability before attempting placement\n  - Maintain proper inventory tracking system\n  - Implement automatic restocking procedures\n\n### Previous Error Tips Still Applicable:\n- Fluid connection validation\n- Power system maintenance\n- Construction error recovery\n- Belt connection validation\n- Mining operation setup\n- Code implementation practices"}
