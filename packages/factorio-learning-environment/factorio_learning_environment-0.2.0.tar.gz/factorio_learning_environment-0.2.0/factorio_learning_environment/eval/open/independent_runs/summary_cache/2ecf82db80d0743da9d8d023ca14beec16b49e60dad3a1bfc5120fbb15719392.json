{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo new structures have been successfully placed on the map. The agent made multiple attempts to create a Lab at position (0.5, 2.5) for supplying Automation Science Packs for research, but all such attempts failed. Although furnaces were referenced during smelting operations, no structure was newly created by the agent.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 Incorrect API usage for get_entities:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Avoid passing unexpected keyword arguments (such as \u201cradius\u201d) or extra positional arguments. Always verify the correct function signature before calling.\n\u2022 Unchecked iteration over a None value:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Ensure that the result from get_entities is verified (or defaulted to an empty list) before attempting to iterate over it.\n\u2022 Lab placement failures due to unavailable inventory:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Confirm that the Lab is present in the inventory prior to attempting placement at a designated coordinate.\n\u2022 Incomplete resource chain for Lab crafting:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Pre-check and secure all necessary intermediate components (for example, iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, and copper-cables) so that crafting a Lab can succeed without missing ingredients."}
