{"content": "The error indicates that the Stone Furnace's inventory is full, preventing you from inserting more coal. This situation typically arises when the furnace is filled with other items or lacks space for additional fuel. Here's how you can address this issue:\n\n### Steps to Resolve Inventory Full Error:\n\n1. **Check Furnace Inventory:**\n   - Inspect the current contents of the furnace to determine what is occupying the space.\n\n2. **Extract Unnecessary Items:**\n   - Remove any items that are not needed immediately, such as excess iron plates or copper plates.\n\n3. **Rebalance Inventory:**\n   - Ensure that there is a balanced amount of iron ore and coal to keep the furnace running efficiently.\n\n### Implementation:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Inspect the furnace inventory\nfurnace_inventory = inspect_inventory(new_furnace)\nprint(f\"Current Furnace Inventory: {furnace_inventory}\")\n\n# Step 2: Extract unnecessary items to free up space\n# Prioritize extracting iron plates if they are present\nif furnace_inventory.get(Prototype.IronPlate, 0) > 0:\n    extract_item(Prototype.IronPlate, new_furnace.position, furnace_inventory.get(Prototype.IronPlate, 0))\n    print(\"Extracted iron plates to free up space.\")\n\n# Step 3: Insert coal if there's now space\nif furnace_inventory.get(Prototype.Coal, 0) < 5:\n    insert_item(Prototype.Coal, new_furnace, quantity=5)\n    print(\"Inserted coal into the furnace.\")\n\n# Step 4: Insert iron ore if there's space\niron_ore_to_insert = 10 - furnace_inventory.get(Prototype.IronOre, 0)\nif iron_ore_to_insert > 0:\n    insert_item(Prototype.IronOre, new_furnace, quantity=iron_ore_to_insert)\n    print(f\"Inserted {iron_ore_to_insert} iron ore into the furnace.\")\n\n# Step 5: Allow time for smelting operations\nsleep(30)\n\n# Step 6: Extract iron plates after smelting\niron_plates_after_processing = inspect_inventory(new_furnace).get(Prototype.IronPlate, 0)\nif iron_plates_after_processing > 0:\n    extract_item(Prototype.IronPlate, new_furnace.position, iron_plates_after_processing)\n    print(f\"Extracted {iron_plates_after_processing} iron plates from the furnace.\")\n\n# Step 7: Attempt to craft the Steam Engine\ncrafted_engine = craft_item(Prototype.SteamEngine, quantity=1)\nassert crafted_engine > 0, \"Failed to craft a Steam Engine after managing resources.\"\n\n# Final verification\nprint(f\"Updated Entities: {get_entities()}\")\nprint(f\"Final Inventory: {inspect_inventory()}\")\n```\n\n### Tips:\n- Regularly check the furnace inventory to avoid overfilling.\n- Prioritize extracting finished products like iron plates to maintain space for raw materials.\n- Balance the input of coal and iron ore to keep the furnace running smoothly.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to manage the furnace inventory effectively and proceed with crafting the Steam Engine.", "summary_range": "[1-166]"}
