{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Stone Furnace at position (0, 0)\nConsists of a Furnace at position (0, 0) with a StoneFurnace prototype.\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position (-15, -50)\nConsists of a BurnerMiningDrill at position (-15, -50) with a BurnerMiningDrill prototype, fueled by coal.\n\n### Wooden Chest at position (40, -83)\nConsists of a WoodenChest at position (40, -83) containing no items.\n\n### Wooden Chest at position (-15, -51)\nConsists of a WoodenChest at position (-15, -51) containing 51 iron ore.\n\n### Transport Belt at position (0.5, 1.5)\nConsists of a TransportBelt at position (0.5, 1.5).\n\n### Transport Belt System\nConsists of multiple TransportBelts connected to form a belt group, used to transport items between entities.\n\n### Burner Mining Drill and Chest System at position (-15, -50)\nConsists of a BurnerMiningDrill at position (-15, -50) connected to a WoodenChest, used to mine and store iron ore.\n\n### Iron Plate Production System\nConsists of a BurnerMiningDrill at position (-15, -50), a WoodenChest at position (-15, -51), and a StoneFurnace at position (0, 0), used to produce iron plates from iron ore.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n### Errors when using undefined functions\n- Ensure the function is defined before attempting to use it, for example, 'empty_item' is not a valid function.\n\n### Errors when asserting incorrect conditions\n- Ensure the condition being asserted is correct, for example, asserting a chest is empty when it is not.\n\n### Errors when crafting items without required sub-ingredients\n- Ensure you have the required sub-ingredients in your inventory or can craft them before attempting to craft an item.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into entities without the item in inventory\n- Ensure you have the item in your inventory before attempting to insert it into an entity.\n\n### Errors when placing entities without required items in inventory\n- Ensure you have the required item in your inventory before attempting to place an entity.\n\n### Errors when extracting items from entities without a valid entity containing the item\n- Ensure the entity being extracted from contains the item being extracted, for example, attempting to extract iron ore from a chest that does not contain iron ore.\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied positions\n- Ensure the position is not occupied by another entity before attempting to place an entity.\n\n### Errors when extracting items from entities without space in destination\n- Ensure there is space in the destination before attempting to extract items from an entity, consider placing a sink object to unblock the entity.\n\n### Errors when crafting items with missing raw resources\n- Ensure you have gathered the required raw resources before attempting to craft an item that requires them.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into entities without sufficient quantity\n- Ensure you have sufficient quantity of the item in your inventory before attempting to insert it into an entity.\n\n### Errors when connecting entities without required items in inventory\n- Ensure you have the required item in your inventory before attempting to connect entities, for example, attempting to connect a transport belt without having a transport belt in your inventory.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into positions instead of entities\n- Ensure the second argument is an Entity or EntityGroup, you passed in a Position, for example, attempting to insert an item into a position instead of an entity.\n\n### Errors when inserting coal into burner mining drill without coal in inventory\n- Ensure you have coal in your inventory before attempting to insert it into a burner mining drill.\n\n### Errors when furnace has no ingredients to smelt\n- Ensure the furnace has the required ingredients to smelt before starting the smelting process, for example, ensure iron ore is available for the furnace to produce iron plates.\n\nNo new structures or errors were detected in the provided execution logs, so the report remains unchanged."}
