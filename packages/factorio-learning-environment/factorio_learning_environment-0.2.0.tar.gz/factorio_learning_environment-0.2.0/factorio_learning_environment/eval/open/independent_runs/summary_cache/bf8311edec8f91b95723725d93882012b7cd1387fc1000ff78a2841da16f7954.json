{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) with a fuel inventory of coal and a drop position at (41.5, -80.5).\n- Stone Furnace at position (41.0, -80.0) with a fuel inventory of coal and currently working status.\n- Wooden Chest at position (43.5, -79.5) with an empty inventory.\n\n### Iron Plate Mine at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) with a fuel inventory of coal and a drop position at (-14.5, -48.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) with an empty inventory.\n\n### Copper Furnace at Position (-20.0, -71.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -71.0) with no fuel and warnings indicating it is out of fuel and has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items without having them in inventory\n- Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. For example, attempting to insert coal when there is none in the inventory will result in an error.\n\n### Timeout Errors\n- Review the logic and performance of your scripts to prevent timeout errors. Ensure that operations are efficient and do not exceed time limits.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined by the agent in the provided steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `iron_drill`: Represents an entity intended to receive coal, but encountered an error due to insufficient coal in inventory.\n- `inventory`: A dictionary representing the current inventory of the agent, including items such as 'stone-furnace', 'wood', 'coal', 'stone', 'iron-ore', 'iron-plate', and 'copper-plate'."}
