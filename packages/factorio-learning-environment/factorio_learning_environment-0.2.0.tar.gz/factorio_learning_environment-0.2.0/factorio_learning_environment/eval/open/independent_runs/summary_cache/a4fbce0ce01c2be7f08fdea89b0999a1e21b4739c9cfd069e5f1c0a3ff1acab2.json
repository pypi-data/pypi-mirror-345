{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n--------------------\nNo new structures have been successfully created on the map. The agent repeatedly attempted to deploy a Lab for supplying Automation Science Packs at position (0.5, 2.5), but none were placed due to errors in inventory validation and crafting chain dependencies. Although existing furnaces were referenced for smelting operations, no new building was constructed.\n\nERROR TIPS\n----------\n\u2022 API Usage \u2013 get_entities Misuse\n  - Use the correct function signature. Avoid unsupported keyword arguments (e.g., \u201cradius\u201d) and extra positional parameters.\n\n\u2022 Inventory and Placement Validation\n  - Before attempting to place a structure, verify that the required item exists in the inventory to prevent placement failures.\n\n\u2022 Handling NoneType Returns\n  - Ensure that functions such as get_entities return a valid list before iterating. Implement fallbacks (e.g., default to an empty list) when a None value is encountered.\n\n\u2022 Crafting Resource Chain Management\n  - Confirm that all prerequisite ingredients (for example, iron-plates needed for iron-gear-wheels and copper-plates for copper-cable leading to electronic-circuits) are available and that their production dependencies are fully satisfied before beginning lab crafting."}
