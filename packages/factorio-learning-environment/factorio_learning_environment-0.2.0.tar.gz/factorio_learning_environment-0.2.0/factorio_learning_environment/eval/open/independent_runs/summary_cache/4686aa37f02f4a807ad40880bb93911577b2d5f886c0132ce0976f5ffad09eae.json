{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nCurrently, there are no structures created on the map. The logs indicate that no entities have been successfully placed, and the inventory remains unchanged with all items still available.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied or invalid tiles\n- Ensure the target tile is unoccupied and valid for the type of entity you are trying to place. Check for obstacles or terrain restrictions before placing entities such as Wooden Chests, Transport Belts, Stone Furnaces, and Burner Inserters.\n\n### General placement errors\n- Verify the placement coordinates are within the map's valid range and that the terrain supports the entity type. Avoid attempting to place entities at coordinates that are out of bounds or unsuitable for the entity type.\n\nBy addressing these errors, the agent can efficiently utilize resources and create functional structures on the map."}
