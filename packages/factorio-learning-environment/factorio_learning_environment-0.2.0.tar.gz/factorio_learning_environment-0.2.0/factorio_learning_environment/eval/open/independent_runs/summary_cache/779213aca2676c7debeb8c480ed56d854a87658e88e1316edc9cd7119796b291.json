{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Setup at Position (2.0, -63.0)\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (2.0, -63.0): Extracts iron ore and drops it into a chest.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (4.0, -63.0): Smelts iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (6.0, -63.0): Additional furnace for smelting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (2.5, -61.5): Collects iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (4.5, -61.5): Additional storage for iron ore or other items.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (3.5, -61.5): Transfers items between chests and furnaces.\n\nThis setup is designed to mine iron ore, smelt it into iron plates, and store the output in chests for further use.\n\n---\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when attempting to insert items without required items in inventory\n- Ensure you have the required items (e.g., coal) in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities like **Burner Mining Drill** or **Burner Inserter**.\n\n#### Errors when the chest at the drop position is full\n- Regularly empty the chest at the drop position of the **Burner Mining Drill** to avoid interruptions in mining operations.\n\n#### Errors when inserting items into furnaces without the required ingredients\n- Ensure you have the required ingredients (e.g., iron ore) in your inventory before attempting to insert them into furnaces.\n\n#### Errors when placing entities without required items in inventory\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to place entities like **Burner Mining Drill** or **Wooden Chest**.\n\n#### Errors when placing entities in occupied or invalid locations\n- Check the target location for obstacles or unplaceable terrain (e.g., water) before placing entities like **Burner Mining Drill**.\n- Ensure the target location is within the maximum placement distance (10 tiles) from the player.\n\n#### Errors when crafting without required sub-ingredients or crafting machines\n- Crafting items like **Stone Furnace** requires sub-ingredients (e.g., stone). Ensure you have the necessary materials and access to a crafting machine or furnace.\n\n#### Errors when connecting chests directly with belts\n- Use an **Inserter** to transfer items between **Wooden Chests** instead of attempting to connect them directly with belts.\n\n#### Errors when placing entities too close to existing structures\n- When placing entities like **Burner Inserter**, ensure there is enough spacing between the new entity and existing structures. Adjust the spacing or direction to avoid conflicts.\n\n#### Errors when crafting without gathering raw resources first\n- Some items, like **Stone Furnace**, require raw resources (e.g., stone) that must be gathered before crafting. Ensure you have harvested the necessary resources before attempting to craft.\n\n#### Errors when inserting items into entities without the required items\n- Ensure you have the required items (e.g., coal) in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities like **Burner Inserter**.\n\n#### Errors when extracting items from furnaces without produced items\n- Ensure the furnace has produced the required items (e.g., iron plates) before attempting to extract them. Check the furnace's status and inventory before extraction.\n\n#### Errors when furnaces run out of fuel\n- Regularly check the fuel levels in furnaces and ensure they have enough coal to continue smelting operations. Refill the fuel as needed.\n\n#### Errors when furnaces have no ingredients to smelt\n- Ensure the furnace has the necessary ingredients (e.g., iron ore) in its inventory before attempting to smelt. Insert the required ingredients if the furnace is empty.\n\n#### Errors when inserters are waiting for source items\n- Ensure the inserter has access to the required source items (e.g., iron ore) before attempting to transfer them. Check the inserter's pickup position and ensure it is correctly aligned with the source entity."}
