# ILThermoPy: Python API for the ILThermo 2.0 database

**ILThermoPy** is a Python library to access [ILThermo 2.0](https://ilthermo.boulder.nist.gov/), which is the NIST standard reference database, containing measured physico-chemical properties for a wide spectrum of ionic liquids. Despite the significant amount of stored data, ILThermo 2.0 cannot be used for machine learning, parametrization of empirical physical models, and other data-driven approaches as is. The reason is that ILThermo 2.0 describes molecular structure of IL's components with a chemical name only, whereas SMILES, InChI and other structure identifiers are not available.

**ILThermoPy** solves this problem via the preliminary semi-automatic conversion of compound names to SMILES with subsequent manual validation. This allows one to conduct a substructural search and to immediately generate chemoinformatic descriptors for the extracted data.


## Please note:
 
- There is no official web API available to access ILThermo 2.0, therefore the stability of this library depends on the stability of the JSON/javascript framework of the webservice.

- ILThermo 2.0 database is regularly updated, at least once a year. Those updates change internal compound IDs, which are used to add SMILES to the extracted data. Therefore, after database's update old versions of **ILThermoPy** can fail to retrieve structural data at least for some of the new entries.


## Installation

**ILThermoPy** can be installed via [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/ilthermopy/):

```ssh
> pip install ilthermopy
```


## Requirements

1. Python 3.7+;

2. requests;

3. pandas;

4. importlib_resources (for Python 3.7 and 3.8).
