{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System at (-7.0,22.5) [UPDATED]\n- **Boiler** at (-7.0,22.5) - Currently fueled with 20 coal (status: WORKING)\n- **Steam engine** at (-3.5,22.5) - Now connected to power network (status: WORKING)\n- **Offshore pump** at (-11.5,21.5) - Operational (status: WORKING)\n- **Fuel system**:\n  - Coal chest at (-6.5,19.5) - Contains 78 coal\n  - Burner inserter at (-6.5,20.5) - Fueled with 6 coal (status: WORKING)\n\n### Oil Extraction System at (17.5,40.5)\n- **Pumpjack** at (17.5,40.5) - Still not receiving power (status: NO_POWER)\n- **Storage tank** at (21.5,40.5) - Now contains 49.42 crude oil (status: WORKING)\n\n### Oil Refinery Complex at (25.5,40.5) [UPDATED]\n- **Oil refinery** at (25.5,40.5) - Now powered (status: FLUID_INGREDIENT_SHORTAGE)\n- **Pipe connections**:\n  - New 8-pipe connection between storage and refinery\n  - Input connection at (26.5,43.5) - Operational\n  - Output connection at (27.5,37.5) - Not configured\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Persistent System Issues\n1. **Pipe placement conflicts** (occurred 15 times)\n   - Repeated failures placing pipes at (-7.5,22.5) and adjacent positions\n   - Solution:\n     - Verify exact boiler connection point\n     - Clear all obstructions before pipe placement\n     - Consider using underground pipes for tight spaces\n\n2. **Distance-related placement errors** (occurred 7 times)\n   - Attempting to place entities beyond reach (23.93 distance vs 10 max)\n   - Solution:\n     - Implement position validation before placement\n     - Move player to target area before construction\n     - Use radar-assisted remote building\n\n3. **Entity removal sequencing** (occurred 5 times)\n   - Trying to place pipes where existing pipes weren't fully removed\n   - Solution:\n     - Implement complete removal verification\n     - Add delay after removal operations\n     - Use area scanning after removal\n\n### New Critical Issues\n1. **Underground pipe placement failures** (occurred 3 times)\n   - Unable to place underground belts at critical junctions\n   - Solution:\n     - Verify minimum spacing requirements\n     - Use straight-line alignment\n     - Pre-calculate connection paths\n\n2. **System reset instability** (occurred 4 times)\n   - Partial system teardown causing placement conflicts\n   - Solution:\n     - Implement complete system shutdown procedures\n     - Document component dependencies\n     - Create isolation zones during reconstruction\n\n3. **Position rounding errors** (occurred 3 times)\n   - Placement attempts at fractional coordinates (-7.6)\n   - Solution:\n     - Round coordinates to nearest 0.5\n     - Validate position alignment\n     - Use grid-snapping placement\n\n### Previous Recommendations Still Valid\n1. Implement fluid system blueprints\n2. Create construction validation steps\n3. Document all connection points\n4. Maintain component position registry"}
