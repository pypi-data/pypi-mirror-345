{"content": "\"\"\"\nThe attempt to load **Iron Ore** into the furnace has failed because the furnace currently contains **Copper Ore**. This indicates that the furnace is not empty and cannot accept additional materials until the current processing is completed.\n\n### Current Findings:\n1. **Furnace Status**: The furnace at (x=5.0, y=0.0) is busy smelting Copper Ore and cannot accept Iron Ore until that process is finished.\n  \n### Next Steps:\n1. **Wait for the Current Smelting Process**: I will need to wait until the Copper Ore smelting is completed before I can load Iron Ore into the furnace.\n2. **Check for Copper Plates**: After waiting, I will check how many Copper Plates have been produced and then proceed to load Iron Ore.\n\nLet's implement a waiting loop to check for the finished smelting process of Copper Ore in the furnace. \n\"\"\"\n\n# Wait for the smelting process of Copper Ore to complete\nwait_time = 30  # Maximum wait time in seconds \nfor _ in range(wait_time):\n    # Check the status of the Copper Plate production after loading\n    furnace_inventory_status_after_wait = inspect_inventory(selected_furnace)\n    \n    # Check how many Copper Plates have been produced\n    copper_plates_produced = furnace_inventory_status_after_wait.get(Prototype.CopperPlate, 0)\n    \n    # If more Copper Plates are produced, break the loop\n    if copper_plates_produced > 0:  # Looking for at least 1 Copper Plate\n        print(f\"Produced Copper Plates: {copper_plates_produced}\")  # Indicate Copper Plates are ready\n        break\n    \n    sleep(1)  # Sleep for a second before checking again\n\n# Finally, check the inventory status again\nfinal_furnace_inventory_after_wait = inspect_inventory(selected_furnace)\nprint(f\"Final Furnace Inventory After Waiting: {final_furnace_inventory_after_wait}\")  # Display inventory after waiting.\nprint(f\"Overall Inventory: {inspect_inventory()}\")  # Check final overall inventory.", "summary_range": "[1-448]"}
