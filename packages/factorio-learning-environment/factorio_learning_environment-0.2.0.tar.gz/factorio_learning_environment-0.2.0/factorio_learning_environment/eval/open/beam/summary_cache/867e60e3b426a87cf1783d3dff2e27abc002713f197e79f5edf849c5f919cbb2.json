{"content": "The attempt to load stone into the active furnace has once again failed to produce the expected results:\n\n### Active Furnace Output Status:\n- The active furnace still holds **18 Iron Plates** and does not reflect the addition of stone or initiate any smelting processes.\n- The furnace remains in a **\"WORKING\"** state but is not processing any materials.\n\n### Overall Inventory Overview:\n- **Current Inventory**:\n  - 4 pieces of stone furnaces\n  - 7 pieces of coal remaining\n  - 5 pieces of iron ore\n  - **1 piece of copper ore** available.\n  - **3 pieces of iron plates** available.\n\n### Observations:\n- The furnace is not recognizing the input of stone, which is necessary for it to enable the smelting process for Copper Ore.\n- This ongoing issue suggests that there may be a deeper problem with the furnace configuration or its ability to accept inputs.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Reset the Furnace**: It may be necessary to completely clear the furnace of all inputs and reset its state.\n2. **Extract All Items**: Attempt to extract any items currently held in the furnace, even if they are not visible or recognized.\n3. **Reinsert Materials**: After clearing the furnace, reinsert the necessary stone and Copper Ore to see if it engages correctly.\n\nLet's attempt to extract any items from the active furnace to reset its state. \n\"\"\"\n\n# Attempt to extract any items from the active furnace\nextract_item(Prototype.IronPlate, active_furnace, quantity=18)  # Extract all 18 pieces of Iron Plates currently in the active furnace\n\n# Check the inventory status of the furnace after extraction\nactive_furnace_status_after_extraction = inspect_inventory(active_furnace)  # Inspect the status after extraction\noverall_inventory_after_extraction = inspect_inventory()  # Check total inventory after extraction.\n\nprint(f\"Active Furnace inventory status after extracting Iron Plates: {active_furnace_status_after_extraction}\")  # Status of the furnace after extraction.\nprint(f\"Overall current inventory after extracting Iron Plates: {overall_inventory_after_extraction}\")  # Total after operations.\nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")  # Review entities displayed on the map.", "summary_range": "[1-338]"}
