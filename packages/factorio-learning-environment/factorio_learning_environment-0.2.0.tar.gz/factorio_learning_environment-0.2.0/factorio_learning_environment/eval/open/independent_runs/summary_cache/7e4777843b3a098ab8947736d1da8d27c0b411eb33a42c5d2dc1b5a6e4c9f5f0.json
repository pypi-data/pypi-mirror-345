Each furnace is paired with burner\u2011inserters and a wooden chest, forming a network that feeds raw ore into automated smelting processes.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Automation Setup\nConsists of:\n\u2022 A burner\u2011mining drill positioned at (\u201315.0, \u201350.0) that extracts iron\u2011ore.\n\u2022 A wooden chest at (\u201313.5, \u201351.5) which collects the mined resource.\n\u2022 An integrated network of transport belts channeling ore from the drill to the chest.\n\n### Steam Power Generation System\nConsists of:\n\u2022 A boiler located at (8.0, 20.5) with two designated connection points at approximately (8.5, 18.5) and (8.5, 22.5).\n\u2022 A network of steam engines deployed at positions such as (0.5, 9.5), (18.5, 11.5), (1.5, 13.5), (13.5, 14.5), (19.5, 14.5), (22.5, 18.5), (17.5, 20.5), (12.5, 21.5), and (4.5, 23.5).\n\u2022 An extra steam engine intended to join the network remains unplaceable due to spatial congestion.\n\n### Automation Research Lab\nConsists of:\n\u2022 A laboratory unit configured to process automation science packs. Multiple diagnostic snapshots\u2014with varying electrical identifiers\u2014confirm the lab\u2019s persistent unpowered state.\n\n### Electrical and Transport Infrastructure\nConsists of:\n\u2022 Several interlinked Electricity Groups (comprising power poles and connection nodes) that maintain the facility\u2019s power network.\n\u2022 Multiple Belt Groups and Pipe Groups that provide continuous material and fluid connectivity across the base.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 Persistent Extra Steam Engine Placement Error\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Issue: The extra steam engine consistently fails to be placed because severe congestion around the boiler at (8.0, 20.5) causes overlapping and misaligned burner\u2011inserters, transport belts, and other interfering entities. This blockage extends to the buildable area near (8.5, 22.5).\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Recommendation: Manual intervention is required. Inspect the boiler area and all adjacent connection interfaces thoroughly; remove, reposition, or adjust interfering entities to create sufficient clearance. Alternatively, relocate the extra steam engine to a dedicated area with ample room or modify the boiler layout to ensure proper spacing.\n\n\u2022 Fuel and Source Item Shortages on Burner\u2011Inserters\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Issue: Multiple burner\u2011inserters exhibit \u201cno fuel\u201d warnings and are awaiting source items, which may contribute to ineffective logistics and increased spatial clutter.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Recommendation: Review and optimize the fuel supply routes and item delivery to these inserters. Reposition or reconfigure them if needed to both clear space and secure a stable resource flow.\n\n\u2022 Connectivity Gaps in the Steam Engine Network\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Issue: Several steam engines report issues of not being connected to the power network and lacking proper liquid inputs, potentially impairing power generation.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Recommendation: Verify that all connection points between the boiler, steam engines, and fluid system are properly aligned and unobstructed. Adjust adjacent entities as necessary to restore network connectivity.\n\n"}
