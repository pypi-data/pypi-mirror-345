{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Transfer System at Position (52.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (52.0, -82.0) extracting coal\n- Wooden Chest at position (53.5, -80.5) for storing coal\n- Burner Inserter at position (52.5, -79.5) transferring coal from the chest to another chest\n- Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -78.5) storing transferred coal\n- Burner Inserter at position (53.5, -78.5) transferring coal to another chest\n- Wooden Chest at position (54.5, -78.5) which is currently full\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting System at Position (-12.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-12.0, -51.0) extracting iron ore\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates\n- Wooden Chest at position (-11.5, -49.5) storing iron ore\n- Burner Inserter at position (-11.5, -48.5) transferring iron ore to the chest\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entities are producing or have items available for inserters to transfer. This can be due to lack of resources or full destination chests.\n\n### Full Destination Chests\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are full to ensure continuous operation of inserters and mining drills. Specifically, the chest at position (54.5, -78.5) needs to be emptied to continue coal transfer.\n\n### Inserters Waiting for Space in Destination\n- Ensure that the destination chests have enough space to accommodate items being transferred by inserters. Consider upgrading to larger chests or adding additional storage.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined by the agent in the provided logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `current_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the count of various items in the player's inventory.\n- `entities_on_map`: List[Entity] - Represents the entities currently placed on the map."}
