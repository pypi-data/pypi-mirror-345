{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (20.5, -4.0)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (22.5, -7.5)\n- Boiler at Position (20.5, -4.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (19.5, -1.5)\n- Connected by a series of pipes and small electric poles\n\n### Copper Plate Production at Position (5.0, 5.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (5.0, 5.0)\n- Inserter at Position (7.5, 5.5) and Wooden Chest at Position (8.5, 5.5)\n- Transport Belt connecting the furnace to the assembling machine\n\n### Copper Cable Factory at Position (10.5, 0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling Machine at Position (10.5, 0.5)\n- Inserter at Position (9.5, 5.5) that feeds the assembling machine\n- Belt Group connecting the furnace at Position (5.0, 5.0) to the assembling machine\n\n### Iron Ore Mining at Position (-11.0, 20.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-11.0, 20.0)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (-11.5, 18.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Extracting Items\n- Ensure that the entity you are trying to extract from contains the required items. For example, attempting to extract copper cables from an assembling machine that does not have any will result in an error.\n\n### Errors due to Missing Ingredients\n- Make sure that all necessary ingredients are available before starting a production process. For instance, the assembling machine at Position (10.5, 0.5) cannot produce copper cables due to a shortage of copper plates.\n\n### Errors when Using Inserters\n- Ensure that inserters have a source item available to pick up. Inserters waiting for source items will not function correctly."}
