For instance, avoid placing an inserter where one already exists (as occurred with the burner inserter near (x=1.5, y=16.5)).\n\n\u2022 API and Attribute Usage:\n   - Use accurate entity attribute names. For example, reference \u201cStoneFurnace\u201d instead of \u201cFurnace\u201d and ensure attributes like drop_position are supported.\n   - Confirm that all necessary variables (e.g., those used for defining target inserters) are properly defined prior to execution.\n\n\u2022 Transport Belt and Inserter Connection:\n   - Transport belts cannot be connected directly to a chest. When automating item delivery, use an inserter as the intermediary target.\n   - Recheck computed drop positions to ensure compatibility with the target entity type before establishing connections.\n\n\u2022 Power Connectivity:\n   - Reassess power network wiring and connection points. Secure stable power links between generators, poles, and associated components to prevent energy drop-offs.\n\n\u2022 Supply Chain Coordination:\n   - Synchronize automated and manual transfers to avoid errors such as attempting to insert items that are not present in the inventory."}
