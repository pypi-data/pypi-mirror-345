{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo new structures have been successfully constructed on the map. Although the agent repeatedly attempted to create and supply a Lab\u2014intended for processing Automation Science Packs for research at Position(x=0.5, y=2.5)\u2014all placement and crafting attempts failed due to insufficient inventory and resource issues. All smelting operations were carried out using pre\u2010existing furnace entities (e.g. the furnace at Position(x=5.0, y=5.0) for iron and the copper furnace at Position(x=-27.0, y=-60.0) for copper), but no new production structures were created.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 API usage errors with get_entities:\n  - Use only parameters supported by the function. Avoid including unexpected keyword arguments (e.g. remove \u2018radius\u2019) or extra positional arguments; always verify the function\u2019s signature before calling.\n\n\u2022 Lab placement and inventory verification:\n  - Confirm that the Lab exists in inventory before attempting placement at a designated position.\n  - Validate resource availability to ensure that placement operations are not attempted with missing items.\n\n\u2022 Handling None values during iteration:\n  - Ensure that functions returning entity lists never yield a None value. Apply fallback logic (e.g. default to an empty list) to avoid iteration errors.\n\n\u2022 Lab crafting resource shortages:\n  - Prior to crafting a Lab, verify that all required sub-ingredients (such as iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, and copper-cables) are available.\n  - Strengthen the production chain by confirming that intermediate resources can be produced (e.g. smelt enough iron plates and copper plates) so that subsequent components can be crafted successfully."}
