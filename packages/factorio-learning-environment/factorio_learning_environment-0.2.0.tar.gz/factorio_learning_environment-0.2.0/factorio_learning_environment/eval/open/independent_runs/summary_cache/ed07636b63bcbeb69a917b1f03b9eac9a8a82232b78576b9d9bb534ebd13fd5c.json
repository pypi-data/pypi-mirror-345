{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (27.5, -7.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (27.5, -7.5)\n- Boiler at position (20.5, -4.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (4.5, -10.5)\n- Pipe connections linking the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-11.0, 20.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-11.5, 18.5) for iron ore collection\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (20.0, 20.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (19.5, 18.5) for copper ore collection\n- Stone Furnace at position (2.0, 0.0) for smelting copper ore into copper plates\n- Additional Stone Furnace at position (5.0, 5.0) for copper plate production\n\n### Copper Cable Factory\nConsists of:\n- Assembling Machine at position (10.5, 0.5) for producing copper cables\n- Inserter at position (3.5, 0.5) for feeding copper plates into the assembling machine\n- BeltGroup connecting the stone furnace at position (2.0, 0.0) to the assembling machine at position (10.5, 0.5)\n\n### Storage Facilities\n- Wooden Chest at position (-3.5, 0.5) and (-3.5, 2.5) for storing materials\n- Wooden Chest at position (8.5, 0.5) and (8.5, 5.5) for storing finished products\n\n### Fluid Transport System\n- PipeGroup at position (19.5, -12.5) for fluid transport\n- PipeGroup at position (5.5, -8.5) for water transport\n- PipeGroup at position (18.5, -3.5) for water transport\n\n### Electrical Network\n- Electricity Group with poles at various positions to distribute power\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Inserters\n- Ensure there is a suitable position for placing inserters by rearranging nearby entities to avoid obstruction.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Fuel\n- Ensure your inventory has sufficient fuel before attempting to insert it into entities like boilers. Regularly check and replenish your fuel stock.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Not Receiving Power\n- Make sure inserters are connected to a power source. Extend the electrical network to cover all inserters.\n\n### Errors with Assembling Machines Lacking Resources\n- Ensure that the assembling machine has all necessary resources, such as copper plates, to produce the intended products.\n\n### Errors with Steam Engine Not Receiving Input Liquid\n- Verify that the steam engine is properly connected to a boiler and that the boiler has a sufficient water supply.\n\n### Errors with Furnaces Lacking Ingredients\n- Regularly supply furnaces with the necessary raw materials to maintain continuous production."}
