Check for blockages or missing items in the supply chain.\n  - Regularly monitor and clear any blockages that might prevent inserters from functioning properly.\n\n- **Chest Full Warning**\n  - Regularly empty chests to prevent mining drills from halting due to full storage.\n  - Implement a more efficient logistics system to move items from chests to their next destination.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions**\n  - No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided logs.\n\n- **Important Variables**\n  - `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the current inventory of items such as 'wooden-chest', 'wood', 'coal', 'iron-ore', and 'iron-plate'. Current values are {'wooden-chest': 3, 'wood': 10, 'coal': 520, 'iron-ore': 1230, 'iron-plate': 1265}."}
