For example, attempting to find the nearest stone furnace when none has been placed will result in an error.\n\n### Errors due to lack of fuel or ingredients in furnaces\n- Make sure to have the necessary fuel and ingredients in your inventory before attempting to use a furnace. For instance, trying to insert coal into a furnace without having coal in your inventory will cause an error."}
