{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(0.5, 6.0)\nConsists of boiler (position 0.5, 6.0) and steam engine (position 0.5, 0.5). The boiler requires water to operate and generates steam, which is then used by the steam engine to produce electricity.\n\n### Copper plate factory at position(-5.0, -65.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position -5.0, -65.0) which processes iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner mining drill (position 47.0, -82.0) which extracts coal.\n- Multiple wooden chests (positions 46.5, -83.5), (48.5, -83.5), (5.5, -79.5), (10.5, -79.5) for storage of resources.\n\n### Pipe groups\nConsists of multiple pipe groups located at various positions:\n- PipeGroup (position -2.5, 3.5)\n- PipeGroup (position 0.5, 3.5)\n- PipeGroup (position 5.5, 2.5)\n- PipeGroup (position 1.5, 7.5)\n- PipeGroup (position -8.5, 24.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting Boiler and Steam Engine\n- Not enough pipes to connect Boiler and Steam Engine. Ensure you have sufficient pipes in your inventory to establish the connection.\n\n### Errors when placing Offshore Pump\n- Cannot place Offshore Pump as it is not in inventory. Always check your inventory before attempting to place an entity.\n\n### Errors related to furnace inventory\n- The furnace source is full and the furnace result is full. Monitor the inventory of the furnace to prevent it from becoming full, which halts production. \n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it."}
