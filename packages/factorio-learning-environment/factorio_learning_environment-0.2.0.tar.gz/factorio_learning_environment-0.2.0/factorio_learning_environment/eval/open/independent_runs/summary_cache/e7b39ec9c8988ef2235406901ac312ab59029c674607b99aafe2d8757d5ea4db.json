{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) and (-12.0, -48.0)\n- Burner Inserters at positions (-13.5, -47.5), (-14.5, -45.5), (-13.5, -45.5), (-11.5, -45.5), (-9.5, -44.5), and (-14.5, -43.5)\n- Wooden Chests at positions (-13.5, -46.5), (-13.5, -44.5), and (-9.5, -43.5)\n- Iron Chest at position (-11.5, -44.5)\n- Transport Belts connecting various positions to facilitate movement of iron plates\n\n### Electricity Generator (Incomplete)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Boiler at positions (-8.0, 0.5) and (0.0, 0.5)\n- Steam Engine at position (3.5, 0.5)\n- Pipe Groups connecting various positions, but not successfully connected\n\n### Belt System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- BeltGroup with inputs from (x=-11.5, y=-46.5) to (x=-9.5, y=-46.5) and outputs from (x=-8.5, y=-45.5) to (x=-8.5, y=-43.5)\n- Additional belts connecting various positions for material transport\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting pipes\n- Ensure that pipes are correctly aligned and connected between the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine. Verify that the connection path is clear and that the pipes are correctly placed to allow fluid flow.\n\n### Inserters waiting for source items\n- Check that the inserters have access to the necessary source items. Ensure that the supply chain feeding the inserters is not interrupted and that there are items available for the inserters to pick up.\n\n### Inserters out of fuel\n- Regularly check and refill the fuel for burner inserters to ensure continuous operation. Consider using a more efficient fuel supply chain to prevent frequent fuel shortages.\n\n### Inserters waiting for space in destination\n- Ensure that the destination for the inserters is not blocked. If the destination is full, consider expanding storage capacity or improving the throughput of the production line to prevent bottlenecks."}
