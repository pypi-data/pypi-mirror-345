Her eyes are gently closed, exuding a serene and peaceful expression. She's wearing a translucent off-the-shoulder dress with puffed sleeves and flowing fabric that also has an iridescent sheen. Set against a plain, muted gray background to highlight the figure, making her the focal point of an enchanting and otherworldly scene.",
