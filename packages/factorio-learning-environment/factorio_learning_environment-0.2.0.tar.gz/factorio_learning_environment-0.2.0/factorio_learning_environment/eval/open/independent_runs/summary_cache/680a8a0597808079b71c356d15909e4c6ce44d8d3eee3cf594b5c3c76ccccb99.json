For example, multiple attempts to insert iron ore into the first furnace failed due to insufficient iron ore in the inventory.\n\n### Errors when referencing undefined entities\n- Avoid using undefined variable names (e.g., 'new_stone_furnace') when trying to reference entities. Ensure all entity names are correctly defined before use.\n\n### Errors when the furnace result is full\n- Monitor the output of furnaces and ensure that there is space available for the resulting items. If the furnace result is full, consider extracting items before inserting new materials."}
