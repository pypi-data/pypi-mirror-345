{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron ore mining and smelting structure at position around (17.5, 72.5)\nConsists of the following connected entities:\n- Electric mining drill at position (17.5, 72.5) facing down, powered but still reporting output blockage due to furnace belt congestion.\n- Stone furnace at position (18.0, 75.0), fueled with coal and actively smelting iron ore, though furnace source and output inventories frequently become full.\n- Three wooden chests at positions (19.5, 75.5), (21.5, 75.5), and (21.5, 77.5) serving as intermediate and output storage for iron plates.\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5) and (20.5, 77.5), fueled and operational, transferring items between chests and furnace.\n- Small electric pole at (15.5, 75.5) providing power connectivity.\n- Despite frequent extraction and reinsertion of iron plates and coal, output belt blockage warning at furnace output persists.\n\nThis structure supports iron ore extraction, smelting, and staged storage of iron plates with powered inserters, but output congestion remains a limiting factor.\n\n### Steam power generation structure at position around (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, -0.5) extracting water.\n- Boiler at (-5.0, 2.5), recently reported out-of-fuel warning but coal has been reinserted to resume operation.\n- Steam engine at (0.5, 6.5), generating power and connected to boiler via pipes.\n- Small electric poles placed near steam engine (0.5, 6.5), boiler (-4.5, -0.5), and newly added poles at (15.5, 75.5) and (25.5, 80.5), forming a connected power network.\n\nThis structure reliably produces electricity from steam power, supplying the factory\u2019s electric grid.\n\n### Iron gear wheel assembly structure at position around (25.5, 80.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine 2 at (25.5, 80.5), powered and actively crafting iron gear wheels with iron plates now being inserted directly into the assembler.\n- Input wooden chest at (21.5, 75.5) feeding iron plates into the assembly area.\n- Output wooden chest at (25.5, 82.5), currently empty but connected to output burner inserter.\n- Burner inserter at (25.5, 83.5), fueled and operational, transferring assembled items into output chest.\n- Small electric pole at (25.5, 80.5) connected to power network.\n\nThis structure is fully powered and supplied with iron plates, enabling continuous iron gear wheel production, though output chest remains empty indicating possible extraction or transport issues downstream.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Persistent output blockage at furnace output belt\n- The electric mining drill at (17.5, 72.5) continues to report \"furnace belt at drop position is blocked,\" causing output congestion.\n- The furnace at (18.0, 75.0) frequently has full source and output inventories, preventing smooth smelting and item flow.\n- To mitigate, extend or clear the output belts and ensure chests or belts downstream have capacity to accept iron plates.\n- Consider redesigning belt routing or adding additional storage to prevent bottlenecks.\n\n### Small electric pole placement conflicts\n- Attempts to place small electric poles near (18.0, 75.0) failed due to collisions with existing mining drill at (17.5, 72.5) or water tiles.\n- Placement near steam engine (0.5, 6.5) succeeded after adjusting position.\n- Always verify tile occupancy and terrain before placement; increase spacing or change reference points to find valid placement tiles.\n\n### Inserter fuel and inventory management\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5), (20.5, 77.5), and (25.5, 83.5) consistently fueled and operational.\n- Inserters occasionally wait for source items, indicating upstream supply delays.\n- Maintain steady supply of fuel and source items to prevent inserter stoppages.\n\n### Assembling machine input/output inventory issues\n- Earlier assembling machine shortages due to lack of iron plates have been resolved by direct insertion of iron plates into assembler at (25.5, 80.5).\n- Output chest remains empty, suggesting items may not be extracted or transported away; verify output inserter operation and downstream logistics.\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nNo new user-defined functions have been introduced in the recent steps."}
