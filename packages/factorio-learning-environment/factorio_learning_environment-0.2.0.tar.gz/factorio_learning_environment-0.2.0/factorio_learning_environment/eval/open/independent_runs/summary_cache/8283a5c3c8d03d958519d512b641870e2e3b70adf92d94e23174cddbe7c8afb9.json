Check the inventory of the chest to confirm the item is present.\n\n#### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Ensure the tile is free before placing an entity. Check the map to confirm the tile is not already occupied by another entity.\n\n#### Errors when using inserters with no source items\n- Ensure the inserter has access to the items it needs to pick up. Check the source entity's inventory and position to confirm the items are available.\n\n#### Errors when mining drills are out of fuel\n- Ensure mining drills have sufficient fuel to operate. Check the fuel inventory of the mining drill and add coal or other fuel sources as needed.\n\n#### Errors when chests are full\n- Ensure the chest at the drop position of a mining drill or inserter is not full. Empty the chest to allow the mining drill or inserter to continue operating."}
