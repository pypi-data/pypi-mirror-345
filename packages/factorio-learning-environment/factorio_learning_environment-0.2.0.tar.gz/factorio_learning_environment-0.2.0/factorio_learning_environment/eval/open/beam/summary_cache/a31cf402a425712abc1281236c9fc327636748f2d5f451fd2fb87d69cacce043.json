{"content": "\"\"\"\nThe extraction of the stone from the active furnace has been successfully completed. Here are the results:\n\n### Active Furnace Output Status:\n- The active furnace is now completely empty, showing no items remaining after extracting all **3 pieces of stone**.\n\n### Overall Inventory Overview:\n- **Current Inventory**:\n  - 4 pieces of stone furnaces\n  - 7 pieces of coal remaining\n  - **1 piece of stone** available (remaining after extraction).\n  - 5 pieces of iron ore\n  - **21 pieces of iron plates** available.\n\n### Observations:\n- The furnace is currently in a **\"WORKING\"** state, but it shows **\"NO INGREDIENTS\"** for smelting, indicating it is not processing any materials.\n- The next step is to load the **1 piece of Copper Ore** into the furnace, as it is now clear of any other materials.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Load Copper Ore into the Furnace**: Insert the **1 piece of Copper Ore** into the active furnace to initiate the smelting process.\n2. **Monitor for Smelting Operation**: Observe closely to ensure that the furnace begins processing the Copper Ore correctly.\n\nLet's proceed to load the Copper Ore into the active furnace. \n\"\"\"\n\n# Load the Copper Ore into the active furnace for smelting\ninsert_item(Prototype.CopperOre, active_furnace, quantity=1)  # Insert 1 piece of Copper Ore into the active furnace\n\n# Check the inventory status of the furnace after loading Copper Ore\nactive_furnace_inventory_status_after_copper_insertion = inspect_inventory(active_furnace)  # Inspect the status of the furnace post-insertion\noverall_inventory_after_copper_loading = inspect_inventory()  # Check total inventory after loading copper.\n\nprint(f\"Active Furnace inventory status after loading Copper Ore: {active_furnace_inventory_status_after_copper_insertion}\")  # Status of the furnace after loading copper.\nprint(f\"Overall current inventory after loading copper: {overall_inventory_after_copper_loading}\")  # Total inventory post operations.\nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")  # Review entities available on the map.", "summary_range": "[1-344]"}
