{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line 1 at (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace at (0.0, 0.0)\n- Input burner inserter at (0.5, -1.5) facing down\n- Output burner inserter at (0.5, 1.5) facing down\n- Input wooden chest at (0.5, -2.5) containing iron ore\n- Output wooden chest at (0.5, 2.5) collecting iron plates\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line 2 at (6.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace at (6.0, 0.0)\n- Input burner inserter at (6.5, -1.5) facing down\n- Output burner inserter at (6.5, 1.5) facing down\n- Input wooden chest at (6.5, -2.5) containing iron ore\n- Output wooden chest at (6.5, 2.5) collecting iron plates\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Incorrect Entity Placement\n- Check if target position is already occupied by another entity before placing\n- When placing entities next to each other, ensure proper spacing to avoid overlap\n- Consider the tile dimensions of entities when placing them adjacent to each other\n\n### Resource Type Conflicts\n- Cannot insert different ore types into the same furnace (e.g. copper ore into furnace containing iron ore)\n- Empty furnace contents before switching ore types\n\n### Technology Requirements\n- Some recipes require technology research before they can be crafted (e.g. assembling machine 1 requires automation technology)\n- Research required technologies before attempting to craft locked recipes\n\n### Inserter Setup Issues\n- Ensure proper orientation of inserters relative to the target buildings\n- Make sure inserters have clear pickup and drop positions\n- Place appropriate containers (chests) at inserter pickup/drop positions\n\n### Resource Requirements\n- Verify all required raw materials are gathered before attempting crafting\n- Some items like wood cannot be crafted and must be harvested directly\n\n### Inserter Blockage\n- When inserters show \"waiting for space in destination\" warnings, ensure there is a valid output container\n- Monitor and manage container capacities to prevent blockages"}
