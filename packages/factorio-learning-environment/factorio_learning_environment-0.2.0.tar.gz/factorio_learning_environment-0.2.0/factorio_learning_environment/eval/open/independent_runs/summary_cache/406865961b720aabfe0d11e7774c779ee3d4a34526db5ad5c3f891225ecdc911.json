Double-check variable names for typos or incorrect references.\n\n### Errors due to full chests\n- Regularly clear out chests that are full to prevent mining operations from halting. Consider setting up automated systems to manage inventory overflow.\n\n### Errors in crafting due to missing items\n- Confirm that all required materials are available in the inventory before attempting to craft items."}
