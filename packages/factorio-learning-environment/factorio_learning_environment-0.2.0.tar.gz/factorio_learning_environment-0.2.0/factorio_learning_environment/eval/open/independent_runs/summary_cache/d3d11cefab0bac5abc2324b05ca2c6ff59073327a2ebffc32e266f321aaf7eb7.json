{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (5.5, 21.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam engine at position (5.5, 21.5)\n- Boiler at position (unknown, but connected to the steam engine)\n- Offshore pump at position (-7.5, 25.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine, with various pipes and pipe-to-ground entities at positions such as (-8.5, 23.5), (-7.5, 23.5), and (5.5, 18.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with coal as fuel\n- Stone furnace at position (10.0, 0.0) with coal as fuel\n- Stone furnace at position (13.0, 0.0) with coal as fuel\n- Stone furnace at position (16.0, 0.0) with coal as fuel\n- Burner inserters at positions (8.5, 0.5), (17.5, 0.5), (19.5, 0.5), and (20.5, 0.5) for moving materials between chests and furnaces\n- Wooden chests at positions (8.5, -0.5), (17.5, -0.5), (19.5, -0.5), and (20.5, -0.5) for storing materials\n\n### Research Lab\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab at an unspecified position, with no research in progress\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- Multiple pipe groups at various positions, including (x=-0.5, y=11.5), (x=5.5, y=18.5), and (x=-8.5, y=23.5), connecting different parts of the factory.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Pipes\n- Ensure that the target position for placing pipes is clear of any existing entities. Remove any obstructing entities before attempting to place a new pipe.\n\n### Steam Engine Not Working\n- Investigate the connections between the steam engine, boiler, and offshore pump to ensure they are correctly configured and connected. Check for any missing or misplaced pipes.\n\n### Attribute Errors in Code\n- When using the API, ensure that the correct attributes and methods are being called. For example, use `PipeGroup` instead of `PipeToGround` if that is the correct attribute.\n\n### Errors when Using Extracting but Being Too Far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when Placing into a Tile Which is Occupied by Another Entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors with Steam Engine Placement\n- Ensure that the target location for placing the steam engine is clear of any obstructions or unplaceable terrain such as water. Verify the position before attempting to place.\n\n### Type Errors in Code\n- When performing operations in code, ensure that the data types are compatible. For example, avoid adding incompatible types such as `ModelPrivateAttr` and `int`."}
