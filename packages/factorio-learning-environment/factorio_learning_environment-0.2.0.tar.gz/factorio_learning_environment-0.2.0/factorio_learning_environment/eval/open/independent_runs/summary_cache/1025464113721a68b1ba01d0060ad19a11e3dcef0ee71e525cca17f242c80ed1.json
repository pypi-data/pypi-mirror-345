{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility at position (-17.0, -52.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner mining drill** at position (-17.0, -52.0) for extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden chest** at position (-16.5, -50.5) for storing extracted iron ore.\n- **Stone furnace** at position (-15.0, -51.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner inserter** at position (-17.5, -50.5) for transferring iron ore from the mining drill to the chest.\n- **Burner inserter** at position (-14.5, -52.5) for transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n\n#### Coal Mining Facility at position (41.0, -86.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner mining drill** at position (41.0, -86.0) for extracting coal.\n- **Burner mining drill** at position (43.0, -86.0) for extracting coal.\n- **Wooden chest** at position (43.5, -84.5) for storing extracted coal.\n- **Wooden chest** at position (41.5, -82.5) for storing extracted coal.\n- **Burner inserter** at position (41.5, -83.5) for transferring coal from the mining drill to the chest.\n\n#### Iron Smelting Facility at position (-13.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone furnace** at position (-13.0, -50.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Wooden chest** at position (-13.5, -51.5) for storing smelted iron plates.\n- **Burner inserter** at position (-11.5, -50.5) for transferring iron plates from the furnace to the chest.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when chests are full\n- **Issue**: Mining drills stop working when the chests they deposit into are full.\n- **Solution**: Regularly empty the chests at positions (-16.5, -50.5) and (43.5, -84.5) to ensure continuous mining operations.\n\n#### Errors when out of fuel\n- **Issue**: Mining drills and furnaces stop working when they run out of fuel.\n- **Solution**: Ensure that mining drills and furnaces are regularly refueled with coal. Keep a sufficient supply of coal in your inventory.\n\n#### Errors when attempting to insert items without having them in inventory\n- **Issue**: Attempting to insert coal into a mining drill without having coal in your inventory.\n- **Solution**: Always check your inventory for the required items before attempting to insert them into entities.\n\n#### Errors when smelting without ingredients\n- **Issue**: Furnaces stop working when they run out of ingredients to smelt.\n- **Solution**: Ensure that furnaces are regularly supplied with iron ore for smelting."}
