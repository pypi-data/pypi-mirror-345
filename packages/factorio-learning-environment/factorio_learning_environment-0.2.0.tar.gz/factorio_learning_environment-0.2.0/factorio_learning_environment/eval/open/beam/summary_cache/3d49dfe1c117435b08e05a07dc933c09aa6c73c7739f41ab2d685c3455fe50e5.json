{"content": "It appears that the **Burner Inserter** is not being detected on the map, which is preventing me from interacting with it. This could be due to a few reasons, such as the inserter being in a state that is not recognized or possibly being removed from the game state.\n\n### Analysis of the Situation\n1. **Entity Detection**: The method used to retrieve the **Burner Inserter** may not be functioning correctly, or there may be no operational **Burner Inserters** available at the moment.\n2. **Status Check**: The **Burner Inserter** might be in a state that is not categorized as \"normal,\" which could lead to it being excluded from the results.\n\n### Steps to Troubleshoot\n1. **Retrieve All Burner Inserters**: Instead of filtering for only operational ones, I will retrieve all **Burner Inserters** on the map and check their statuses.\n2. **Log All Entities**: I will log all entities of type **Burner Inserter** to see if they exist and what their statuses are.\n\n### Revised Approach\n```python\n# Step 1: Retrieve all Burner Inserters on the map\nburner_inserters = get_entities({Prototype.BurnerInserter})\n\n# Step 2: Log the status of all Burner Inserters found\nif burner_inserters:\n    for inserter in burner_inserters:\n        print(f\"Found Burner Inserter at position {inserter.position} with status {inserter.status}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No Burner Inserters found on the map.\")\n\n# Step 3: If any Burner Inserters are found, check their status and attempt to insert coal into the first one.\nif burner_inserters:\n    first_inserter = burner_inserters[0]  # Use the first found Burner Inserter\n    if current_inventory.get(Prototype.Coal, 0) >= 5:\n        insert_item(Prototype.Coal, first_inserter, 5)  # Insert into the first Burner Inserter\n        print(\"Inserted 5 coal into the Burner Inserter.\")\n        \n        # Step 4: Check the status of the Burner Inserter after the insertion\n        print(\"Status of the Burner Inserter after refueling:\", first_inserter.status)\n    else:\n        print(\"Not enough coal in inventory to insert into the Burner Inserter.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No Burner Inserters found on the map.\")\n```\n\n### Expected Outcome\nThis approach should provide clarity on whether any **Burner Inserters** exist on the map and what their statuses are. If found, I will attempt to insert coal into the first one and check its status afterward.", "summary_range": "[1-2026]"}
