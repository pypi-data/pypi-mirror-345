{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnaces**:\n  - Stone furnace at position (x=-15.0, y=-48.0)\n  - Stone furnace at position (x=-13.0, y=-48.0)\n  - Stone furnace at position (x=-11.0, y=-48.0)\n- **Storage Chests**:\n  - Wooden chest at position (x=-10.5, y=-50.5) for additional iron plate storage\n  - Wooden chest at position (x=-9.5, y=-50.5) for additional iron plate storage\n  - Wooden chest at position (x=-8.5, y=-50.5) for additional iron plate storage\n  - Wooden chest at position (x=-7.5, y=-50.5) for additional iron plate storage\n  - Wooden chest at position (x=-6.5, y=-50.5) for additional iron plate storage\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill**:\n  - Positioned at (x=4.0, y=-60.0)\n- **Storage Chests**:\n  - Wooden chest at position (x=4.5, y=-58.5) for iron ore storage\n  - Additional chests at positions (x=5.5, y=-60.5), (x=7.5, y=-60.5), (x=6.5, y=-60.5), (x=9.5, y=-60.5), and (x=8.5, y=-60.5) for overflow storage\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Full Storage\n- Ensure that storage chests are not full before attempting to deposit items. Consider adding more storage or managing inventory more efficiently to prevent overflow.\n\n### Errors with No Ingredients in Furnaces\n- Regularly check that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to continue production. Ensure a steady supply of iron ore to prevent production halts.\n\n### Errors with Mining Drill Output\n- Ensure that the output chest of the mining drill is regularly emptied to prevent mining stoppages. Consider automating the emptying process to maintain continuous operation.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions**: No utility functions have been defined by the agent in the provided logs.\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `iron_plates`: int, representing the total number of iron plates moved to storage chests.\n  - `iron_ore`: int, representing the total number of iron ore extracted from storage chests.\n  - `coal`: int, representing the total amount of coal in inventory.\n  - `wood`: int, representing the total amount of wood in inventory.\n  - `iron_gear_wheel`: int, representing the total number of iron gear wheels in inventory."}
