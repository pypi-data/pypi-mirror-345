{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (10.5, 34.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (10.5, 34.5)\n- Boiler at position (0.5, 28.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-3.5, 27.5)\n- PipeGroup for water transport starting at position (-3.5, 26.5)\n- PipeGroup for steam transport starting at position (1.5, 26.5)\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at various positions including (9.5, 23.5), (7.5, 13.5), (7.5, 9.5), (16.5, 31.5), (12.5, 34.5), (7.5, 17.5)\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (40.0, -84.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (40.5, -82.5) and (41.5, -83.5) for coal storage\n- BeltGroup for coal transport with belts at positions including (50.5, -86.5) to (48.5, -86.5) and (43.5, -84.5) to (45.5, -84.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Storage Facility\nConsists of:\n- Iron Chest at positions (0.5, 0.5), (1.5, 0.5), and (2.5, 0.5) for storing iron plates and coal\n\n### Lab at Position (5.5, 5.5)\n- Connected to the power source at position (10.5, 34.5) via ElectricityGroup\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Power Connections\n- Ensure all electricity groups are properly connected to provide power to all necessary entities. Verify connections and check for any missing or misaligned poles.\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities Too Far\n- Move closer to the target position before attempting to place an entity. The maximum placement distance is 10 units.\n\n### Errors with Pipe Connections\n- Verify that all pipe connections are correctly established to ensure fluid transport. Check for any missing or misaligned pipes.\n\n### Errors with Extracting but Being Too Far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when Placing into a Tile Occupied by Another Entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity on a tile before attempting placement."}
