Ensure there is space in the destination chest before inserting.\n- Extracted items are on the ground because the inserter cannot place them in the destination. Ensure the inserter has a valid destination and space to place items.\n- Burner mining drill output is blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output. Place a chest or other entity to receive the output.\n\nNAMESPACE\n- No new functions defined or errors in function calls.\n- No new variables assigned.\n```"}
