{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (-15.0, -48.0) fueled with coal, currently working with iron ore and producing iron plates.\n- Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0) fueled with coal, currently working with iron ore and producing iron plates.\n- Furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0) fueled with coal, currently working with iron ore and producing iron plates.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage Facility at Position (4.0, -60.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (4.0, -60.0) fueled with coal, currently working and extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden chest at position (4.5, -58.5) storing extracted iron ore, currently full.\n- Multiple wooden chests positioned around the mining drill for additional storage.\n\n### Iron Ore Storage at Position (-5.5, -50.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Iron chest at position (-5.5, -50.5) storing iron ore and iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Full Storage\n- Ensure to regularly empty chests that are full to prevent mining operations from halting. For example, the chest at position (4.5, -58.5) is full, which stops the mining drill from continuing its operation.\n\n### Errors with Full Output Chests\n- Regularly check and clear output chests to prevent production stalls. Chests at positions (-11.5, -50.5), (-10.5, -50.5), (-9.5, -50.5), and (-8.5, -50.5) are full, which may impede the storage of newly produced iron plates.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- None defined in the current steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `final_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the final inventory state with quantities of wood, coal, iron ore, iron plates, and iron gear wheels. Current values are:\n  - Wood: 10\n  - Coal: 350\n  - Iron Ore: 173\n  - Iron Plate: 5757\n  - Iron Gear Wheel: 4"}
