    """Find measurement pattern corresponding to graph measurements.

    Every sequence of measurements in the graph state picture (i.e.,
    with explicitly undoing the byproduct operators at every step)
    corresponds to a measurement pattern of Pauli measurements
    that postpones all corrections operations to the very end.
    There are multiple sequences that lead to the same
    pattern.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sequence : list[tuple]
        A series of graph measurements that are performed in order.
        Format: ("x" or "y" or "z", qubit_index) for x measurements

        like so ("x", qubit_index, b0).
    graph : nx.Graph
        The start graph to which the sequence of measurements is applied.


    Returns
    -------
    list[str]
        The measurement pattern for postponed correction operations from
        the lowest qubit index to the highest qubit index.
        "x", "y" or "z" for a Pauli measurement. "." for no measurement.
