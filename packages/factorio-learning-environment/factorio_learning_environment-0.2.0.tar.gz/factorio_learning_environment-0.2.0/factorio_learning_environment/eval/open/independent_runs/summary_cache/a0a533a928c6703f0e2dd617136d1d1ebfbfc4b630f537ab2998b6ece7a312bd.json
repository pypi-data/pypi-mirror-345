For example, ensure you have coal available before trying to insert it into a boiler.\n\n### Errors When Furnaces Have No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Check that all furnaces have the required ingredients to process. If a furnace is not smelting, verify that the necessary raw materials are available and being fed into the furnace."}
