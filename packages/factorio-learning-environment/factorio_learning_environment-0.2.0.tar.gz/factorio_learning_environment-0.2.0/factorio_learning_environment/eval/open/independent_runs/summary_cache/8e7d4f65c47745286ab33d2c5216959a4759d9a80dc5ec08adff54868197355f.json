{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\u2022 No new structures have been successfully built during this execution cycle. Multiple attempts to craft and place a Lab (the intended research\u2010supply structure) did not succeed due to inventory shortages and missing sub\u2010ingredients.\n\u2022 The agent did reference two pre\u2010existing smelting units used for resource processing:\n\u2003\u2013 Iron Smelting Furnace at Position(x=5.0, y=5.0)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Use-case: Converting iron ore (with coal) into iron plates.\n\u2003\u2013 Copper Smelting Furnace at Position(x=-27.0, y=-60.0)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Use-case: Converting copper ore (with coal) into copper plates.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 API Usage for Entity Retrieval:\n\u2003\u2013 When calling get_entities, use the proper function signature. Avoid unexpected keyword arguments (such as \u201cradius\u201d) or an incorrect number of positional arguments.\n\u2022 Handling Null Returns:\n\u2003\u2013 Check that functions returning entity lists do not yield None before iterating. Default to an empty list when no entities are found.\n\u2022 Lab Placement and Inventory Verification:\n\u2003\u2013 Ensure that a Lab is present in inventory (or has been successfully crafted) before attempting placement at a desired position.\n\u2022 Lab Crafting Prerequisites:\n\u2003\u2013 Confirm that all required sub-ingredients (for example, iron-gear-wheels, electronic circuits, and copper cables) are available in sufficient quantities. Verify that necessary production processes (such as smelting for iron/copper plates) are complete before beginning Lab crafting attempts."}
