To ensure proper water supply, always use the working fluid_system ID (currently 35884) as assigned to both the boiler and the offshore pump.\n- Rigid Pipeline Stabilization Approach:\n  \u2022 Avoid relying solely on fixed waiting periods for pipeline stabilization. Instead, implement dynamic connectivity checks to confirm that pipelines are properly connected before proceeding with further connection attempts."}
