{"content": "### Furnace Recipe Inspection Result:\nThe current recipe configured in the active stone furnace is as follows:\n\n- **Name**: `stone-furnace`\n- **Ingredients**: \n  - 5 pieces of **stone**\n- **Products**: None (indicating that the furnace is not set to produce anything at the moment)\n- **Energy**: 0 (indicating no energy consumption for this recipe)\n- **Category**: None\n- **Enabled**: **False** (this indicates that the recipe is not currently active)\n\n### Observations:\n- The recipe requires **5 pieces of stone** to function, but the furnace is currently set to **disabled**. This is likely the reason why it is not processing any materials, despite having sufficient coal as fuel.\n- The furnace recognizes only **3 pieces of stone** from previous attempts, which is not enough to meet the recipe requirements.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Enable the Recipe**: I will enable the recipe for the stone furnace to allow it to process materials.\n2. **Extract Remaining Stone**: I will extract the **3 pieces of stone** currently in the furnace to clear its inputs.\n3. **Load Stone and Copper Ore**: After clearing the furnace, I will load **5 pieces of stone** and **1 piece of Copper Ore** into it.\n4. **Monitor for Successful Smelting Operation**: Finally, I will check if the furnace starts processing the Copper Ore into Copper Plates.\n\nLet's proceed to enable the recipe in the active furnace. \n\"\"\"\n\n# Enable the recipe in the active furnace\nenable_recipe(active_furnace)  # Enable the recipe for the active stone furnace\n\n# Check the status of the furnace after enabling the recipe\nactive_furnace_status_after_enabling = inspect_inventory(active_furnace)  # Inspect the status after enabling the recipe\nprint(f\"Active Furnace status after enabling recipe: {active_furnace_status_after_enabling}\")  # Print the status of the furnace after enabling.\n", "summary_range": "[1-434]"}
