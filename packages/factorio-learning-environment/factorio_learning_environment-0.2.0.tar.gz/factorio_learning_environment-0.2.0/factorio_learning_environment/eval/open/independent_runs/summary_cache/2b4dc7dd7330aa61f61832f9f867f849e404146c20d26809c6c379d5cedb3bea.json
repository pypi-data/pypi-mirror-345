{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, y=-60.0) extracting iron ore and depositing it into a chest at position (4.5, y=-58.5).\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (4.5, y=-58.5), (5.5, y=-60.5), (6.5, y=-60.5), (7.5, y=-60.5), (8.5, y=-60.5), and (9.5, y=-60.5) for storage purposes.\n- **Iron Chest** at position (-5.5, y=-50.5) used for storing extracted iron ore and iron plates.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (-15.0, y=-48.0), (-13.0, y=-48.0), and (-11.0, y=-48.0) used for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Full Chests\n- Ensure that chests have sufficient space before depositing items. Regularly check and empty chests that are full to prevent mining operations from halting.\n\n### Errors with Resource Management\n- Monitor the inventory levels of critical resources such as coal and iron ore to ensure continuous operation of mining drills and furnaces. Automate resource distribution where possible to maintain efficiency.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the given steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `wood`: int = 10\n- `coal`: int = 470\n- `iron-ore`: int = 143\n- `iron-plate`: int = 5498\n- `iron-gear-wheel`: int = 4\n\nThese variables represent the current inventory levels of the agent, which are crucial for planning further actions in the game."}
