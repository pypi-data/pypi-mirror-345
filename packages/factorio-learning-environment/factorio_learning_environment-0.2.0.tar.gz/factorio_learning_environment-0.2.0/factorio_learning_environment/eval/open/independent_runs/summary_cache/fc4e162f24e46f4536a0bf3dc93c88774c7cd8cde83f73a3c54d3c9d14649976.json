{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Coal mining operation at position(x=41, y=-82)\nConsists of a burner-mining-drill (position x=41, y=-82) with a fuel source of coal, a wooden chest (position x=40.5, y=-83.5) for storing coal, and another wooden chest (position x=41.5, y=-83.5) for storing coal. The drill is working but has warnings that the fuel source is full and the chest at the drop position is full.\n\n### Coal transportation system\nConsists of a burner-inserter (position x=39.5, y=-81.5) that is waiting for source items. The inserter is connected to the burner-mining-drill.\n\n### Furnace at position(x=0, y=0)\nConsists of a stone-furnace with a fuel source of coal. The furnace has warnings that there are no ingredients to smelt and the furnace fuel source is full.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n### Errors when inserting items into a full inventory\n- Ensure that the inventory is not full before attempting to insert items.\n- Check the warnings for the entity to see if the inventory is full.\n\n### Errors when extracting items from a chest\n- Ensure that the chest is not empty before attempting to extract items.\n- Check the warnings for the entity to see if the chest is empty.\n\n### Errors when mining with a full chest at the drop position\n- Ensure that the chest at the drop position is not full before attempting to mine.\n- Empty the chest at the drop position to continue mining.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n* Important variables:\n  + `coal_chest`: a wooden chest for storing coal\n  + `iron_chest`: a wooden chest for storing coal\n  + `drill`: a burner-mining-drill for mining coal\n  + `inserter`: a burner-inserter for transporting coal\n  + `furnace`: a stone-furnace for smelting coal\n* Utility functions:\n  + `insert_item`: a function for inserting items into an entity's inventory\n  + `extract_item`: a function for extracting items from an entity's inventory\n* Failure modes:\n  + `insert_item` fails when the inventory is full\n  + `extract_item` fails when the chest is empty\n* Success modes:\n  + `insert_item` succeeds when the inventory is not full\n  + `extract_item` succeeds when the chest is not empty"}
