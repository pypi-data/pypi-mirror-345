{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace (position 0.0, 0.0)\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position (42.0, -83.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position 42.0, -83.0)\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position -15.0, -50.0)\n\n### Wooden Chest at position (42.5, -81.5)\nConsists of:\n- Wooden Chest (position 42.5, -81.5)\n\n### Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of:\n- Wooden Chest (position -14.5, -48.5)\n\n### Burner Inserter at position (42.5, -80.5)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Inserter (position 42.5, -80.5)\n\n### Burner Inserter at position (43.5, -81.5)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Inserter (position 43.5, -81.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to fuel supply\n- Ensure that the burner mining drills are supplied with fuel regularly to avoid them becoming inactive (Status: NO_FUEL).\n\n### Errors when inserting items into entities\n- Confirm that the destination entity has space before inserting items. For example, the burner inserter at position (43.5, -81.5) is often waiting for space in its destination.\n\n### Errors when the stone furnace lacks ingredients\n- Make sure to supply the stone furnace with the necessary ingredients to keep it operational. It has been observed with status NO_INGREDIENTS multiple times.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n#### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked.\n\n#### Important Variables\n- `coal`: int\n- `iron-ore`: int\n- `iron-plate`: int\n- `wood`: int\n- `iron-gear-wheel`: int"}
