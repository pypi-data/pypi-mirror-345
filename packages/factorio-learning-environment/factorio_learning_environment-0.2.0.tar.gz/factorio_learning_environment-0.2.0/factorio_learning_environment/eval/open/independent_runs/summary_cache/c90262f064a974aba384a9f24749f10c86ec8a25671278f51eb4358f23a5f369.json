{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Coal Mining Operation at Position (x=41.0, y=-86.0)\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=41.0, y=-86.0) and (x=43.0, y=-86.0) extracting coal.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=43.5, y=-84.5) storing coal.\n- **Transport Belt** at position (x=41.5, y=-84.5) connecting the mining drills to the chest.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=41.5, y=-83.5) moving coal from the belt to a chest at (x=41.5, y=-82.5).\n\n#### Iron Ore Mining Operation at Position (x=-17.0, y=-52.0)\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-17.0, y=-52.0) extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-16.5, y=-50.5) storing iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-17.5, y=-50.5) moving iron ore from the mining drill to the chest.\n\n#### Smelting Setup at Position (x=-15.0, y=-51.0)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-15.0, y=-51.0) and (x=-13.0, y=-50.0) for smelting iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-14.5, y=-52.5) attempting to feed iron ore into the furnace.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-13.5, y=-51.5) for storing smelted iron plates.\n\n---\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when placing entities next to occupied tiles\n- **Issue**: Repeated attempts to place a burner inserter next to a furnace at (x=-15.0, y=-51.0) failed due to collisions with the furnace or other entities.\n- **Solution**: Increase the spacing or change the direction when placing entities next to existing structures. Ensure the target position is free before placing.\n\n#### Errors with inserter placement due to blocked positions\n- **Issue**: Attempts to place inserters at positions (x=-12.5, y=-51) and (x=-15.5, y=-51) failed due to collisions or invalid placement areas (e.g., water or existing entities).\n- **Solution**: Verify the placement area is valid and free of obstructions before placing inserters. Use a larger spacing or adjust the reference position.\n\n#### Errors with mining drills due to full chests\n- **Issue**: Mining drills at (x=43.0, y=-86.0) and (x=-17.0, y=-52.0) stopped because the chests at their drop positions were full.\n- **Solution**: Regularly empty chests connected to mining drills to ensure continuous operation. Consider adding additional storage or transport belts to handle excess resources.\n\n#### Errors with furnaces due to lack of ingredients\n- **Issue**: Furnaces at (x=-15.0, y=-51.0) and (x=-13.0, y=-50.0) are idle because they lack iron ore to smelt.\n- **Solution**: Ensure a steady supply of raw materials (e.g., iron ore) is delivered to furnaces using inserters and belts. Check the inserter setup for proper functionality.\n\n#### Errors with inserters waiting for source items\n- **Issue**: Inserters at (x=41.5, y=-83.5) and (x=43.5, y=-77.5) are idle because they are waiting for items to move.\n- **Solution**: Verify that the source entities (e.g., belts or chests) have items available for the inserters to pick up. Ensure the inserter setup is correctly aligned with the source and destination."}
