{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Transport System\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0) extracting iron ore.\n- **Transport Belt Network** connecting the mining drill to other parts of the system, with belts at positions:\n  - (x=-14.5, y=-54.5)\n  - (x=-13.5, y=-54.5)\n  - (x=-12.5, y=-54.5)\n  - (x=-15.5, y=-52.5)\n\n### Iron Smelting Facility\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-10.0, y=-50.0) for smelting iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserters** for moving materials:\n  - Inserter at position (x=-10.5, y=-48.5) connected to the furnace.\n  - Inserter at position (x=-7.5, y=-49.5) connected to a wooden chest.\n  - Inserter at position (x=-5.5, y=-49.5) with no specified connection.\n\n### Storage System\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-8.5, y=-49.5) for storing materials.\n\n### Belt Groups\n- **Belt Group 1**: Inputs from (x=-15.5, y=-54.5) to (x=-13.5, y=-54.5), outputs from (x=-12.5, y=-54.5) to (x=-10.5, y=-54.5).\n- **Belt Group 2**: Inputs from (x=-21.5, y=-51.5) to (x=-19.5, y=-51.5), outputs from (x=-18.5, y=-49.5) to (x=-16.5, y=-49.5).\n- **Belt Group 3**: Inputs from (x=-17.5, y=-50.5) to (x=-17.5, y=-52.5), outputs from (x=-16.5, y=-55.5) to (x=-14.5, y=-55.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Belts to Non-Compatible Entities\n- Ensure that belts are connected to compatible entities. Belts cannot be directly connected to a **Prototype.StoneFurnace** or **Prototype.WoodenChest**. Use an inserter to transfer items from belts to these entities.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Inventory Items\n- Maintain adequate inventory levels to avoid errors such as \"No coal to insert from your inventory.\" Regularly check and replenish inventory items as needed.\n\n### General Tips for Refueling\n- Regularly refuel mining drills, furnaces, and inserters to prevent them from running out of fuel, which can halt production processes."}
