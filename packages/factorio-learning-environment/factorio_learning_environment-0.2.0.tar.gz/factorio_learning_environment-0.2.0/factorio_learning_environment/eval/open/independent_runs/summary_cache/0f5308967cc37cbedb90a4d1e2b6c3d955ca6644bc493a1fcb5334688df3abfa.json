{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-13.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0)\n- Burner Inserter at position (-14.5, -46.5)\n\n### Coal Production Facility at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -80.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (43.0, -82.0)\n- Burner Inserter at position (43.5, -80.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items without sufficient inventory\n- Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. This will prevent errors like \"Could not insert: No iron-ore to insert from your inventory.\"\n\n### Errors due to full chests\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are full to prevent mining drills from stopping. For instance, empty the chest at (41.5, -80.5) to continue mining coal, and the chest at (-14.5, -48.5) to continue mining iron ore.\n\n### Errors related to missing ingredients for smelting\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. For example, the furnace at (-13.0, -48.0) has a warning for \"no ingredients to smelt.\" Make sure to supply the required materials to keep production running smoothly."}
