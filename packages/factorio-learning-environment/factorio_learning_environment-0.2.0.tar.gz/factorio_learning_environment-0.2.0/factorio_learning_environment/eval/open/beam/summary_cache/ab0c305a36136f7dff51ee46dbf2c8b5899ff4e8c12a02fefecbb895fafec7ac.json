{"content": "\"\"\"\nThe attempt to load stone into the active furnace has yielded partial success, but it appears that the furnace is still not recognizing the full amount of stone being inserted:\n\n### Active Furnace Output Status:\n- The active furnace now contains **3 pieces of stone** after the attempted insertion of **5 pieces**. This indicates that the furnace is still unable to register all inputs correctly.\n- The furnace is currently marked as **\"WORKING,\"** which suggests that it is in a processing state, but it is unclear what it is processing since it has not yet received the necessary Copper Ore.\n\n### Overall Inventory Overview:\n- **Current Inventory**:\n  - 4 pieces of stone furnaces\n  - 7 pieces of coal remaining\n  - 5 pieces of iron ore\n  - **1 piece of copper ore available.**\n  - **21 pieces of iron plates available.**\n  - **3 pieces of stone** are currently in the furnace.\n\n### Observations:\n- The furnace has successfully recognized some stone, but it still shows only **3 pieces** instead of the expected **5 pieces**.\n- The Copper Ore has not yet been added, which may be necessary for the furnace to begin processing.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Insert Copper Ore into the Furnace**: I will add the **1 piece of Copper Ore** into the active furnace to see if it can process it alongside the stone.\n2. **Monitor the Furnace**: After adding the Copper Ore, I will check if the furnace begins processing and whether it recognizes the total stone input correctly.\n\nLet's proceed by inserting the Copper Ore into the active furnace. \n\"\"\"\n\n# Insert the Copper Ore into the active furnace to enable smelting\ninsert_item(Prototype.CopperOre, active_furnace, quantity=1)  # Insert 1 piece of Copper Ore into the active furnace\n\n# Check the inventory status of the furnace after loading Copper Ore\nactive_furnace_inventory_status_after_copper_insertion = inspect_inventory(active_furnace)  # Inspect the status of the furnace post-insertion\noverall_inventory_after_copper_loading = inspect_inventory()  # Check total inventory after inserting Copper Ore.\n\nprint(f\"Active Furnace inventory status after loading Copper Ore: {active_furnace_inventory_status_after_copper_insertion}\")  # Status of the furnace after loading Copper Ore.\nprint(f\"Overall current inventory after loading Copper Ore: {overall_inventory_after_copper_loading}\")  # Total inventory post operations.\nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")  # Review entities available on the map.", "summary_range": "[1-390]"}
