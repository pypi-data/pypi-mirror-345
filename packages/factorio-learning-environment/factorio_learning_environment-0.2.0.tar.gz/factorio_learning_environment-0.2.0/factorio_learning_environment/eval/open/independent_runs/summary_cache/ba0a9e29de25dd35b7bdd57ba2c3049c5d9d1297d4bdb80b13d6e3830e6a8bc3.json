This is essential to prevent cascading failures when attempting complex crafts (e.g., automation science packs and research labs).\n- Inventory Validation before Placement:\n  - Verify that the required item (for example, a lab) is present in your inventory before attempting placement. This avoids errors stemming from trying to place an entity that has not been successfully crafted.\n- Entity Placement Collisions:\n  - Check the target tile for spatial availability before placing an entity to avoid placement conflicts.\n- Technology and Recipe Prerequisites:\n  - Confirm that all necessary research has been completed to unlock the required recipes prior to initiating any crafting.\n- Improper API Usage for Position Access:\n  - Use correct property access (e.g., assembly_area.center instead of assembly_area.center()) to prevent API-related errors."}
