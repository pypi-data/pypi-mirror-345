{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5) for coal storage.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Storage at Position (-23.0, -68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-23.5, -69.5) for copper ore storage.\n- Transport Belt network connecting the mining drill to the chest.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -54.5) for iron ore storage.\n\n### Iron Plate Production at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with a Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5) for storing coal, iron ore, and iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) for transferring items between the chest and the furnace.\n\n### Belt Networks\nMultiple BeltGroups are present, facilitating the movement of resources between various entities:\n- BeltGroup at positions (e.g., (-25.5, -70.5) to (-23.5, -70.5)) for transporting resources between mining drills and storage chests.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Stale Entity Data\n- Ensure that entity data is refreshed and up-to-date before performing operations that depend on entity status or attributes.\n\n### Attribute Errors with BeltGroup Objects\n- Verify that operations involving BeltGroup objects are compatible with their attributes. BeltGroups do not have a 'prototype' attribute; ensure the correct object type is being used in conditions and operations.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that inserters have access to source items. Check that the source chest or belt is not empty and that the inserter is correctly positioned to pick up items.\n\n### Out of Fuel Warnings\n- Regularly check and refuel entities like Burner Mining Drills to maintain continuous operation and prevent downtime.\n\n### No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to process. Verify that the supply chain is intact and that resources are being delivered to the furnace.\n\n### Chest is Full Warnings\n- Monitor the inventory levels of chests to prevent overflow and ensure that there is space available for new items being transferred by inserters."}
