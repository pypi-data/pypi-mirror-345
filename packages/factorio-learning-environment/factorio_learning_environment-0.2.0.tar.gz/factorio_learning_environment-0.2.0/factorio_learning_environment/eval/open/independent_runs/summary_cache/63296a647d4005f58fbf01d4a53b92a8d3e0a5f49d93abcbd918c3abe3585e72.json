Use the active fluid_system (currently 33820 as reflected in the boiler and offshore pump) and confirm connectivity across the related pipeline network.\n- Inflexible Pipeline Stabilization Strategy:\n  \u2022 The fixed 10-second wait for pipeline stabilization introduces unnecessary delays. Implement dynamic connectivity checks to proceed as soon as pipeline stabilization is verified."}
