{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-10.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-10.0, -50.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-10.5, -48.5) for transferring items into the furnace.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-8.5, -49.5) for storing output items.\n- Burner Inserters at positions (-7.5, -49.5) and (-5.5, -49.5) for facilitating item movement.\n\n### Mining and Transport System at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) for extracting iron ore.\n- BeltGroup with belts connecting positions (-15.5, -54.5) to (-13.5, -54.5) and further to (-12.5, -54.5), facilitating ore transport.\n\n### Additional Belt Systems\n- BeltGroup with belts from positions (-21.5, -51.5) to (-19.5, -51.5) and further to (-18.5, -49.5), facilitating item transport.\n- BeltGroup with belts from positions (-17.5, -50.5) to (-17.5, -52.5) and further to (-16.5, -55.5), facilitating item transport.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Belts to Furnaces or Chests\n- Ensure that belts are not directly connected to furnaces or chests. Use inserters to transfer items between belts and these entities.\n\n### Undefined Variables in Code\n- Ensure all variables, such as `drill_to_belt_inserter`, are defined before use. Double-check variable names for typos or incorrect references.\n\n### Errors when Inspecting Inventory of Belts\n- Verify that the belt entity exists and is correctly referenced before attempting to inspect its inventory.\n\n### Errors when Inserting Items\n- Ensure sufficient items are available in the inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity."}
