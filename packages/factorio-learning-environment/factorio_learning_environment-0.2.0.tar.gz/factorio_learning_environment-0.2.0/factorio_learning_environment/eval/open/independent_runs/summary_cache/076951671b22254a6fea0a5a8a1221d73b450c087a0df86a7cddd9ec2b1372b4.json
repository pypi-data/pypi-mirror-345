Remove any existing entity at the target position before placing a new one.\n\n### Errors when extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors due to full chests\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are full to prevent mining drills from stopping due to lack of space.\n\n### Errors due to lack of fuel\n- Ensure that mining drills and furnaces have sufficient fuel to operate continuously. Regularly refuel to avoid interruptions.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - `place_entity`: Attempts to place an entity at a specified position. Failure occurs if the position is already occupied.\n  \n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `new_storage_chest_1`: Represents the attempt to place a new wooden chest at a specific position.\n  - `new_storage_chest_position_1`: The target position for placing `new_storage_chest_1`.\n\nThis report summarizes the current state of structures and errors encountered, providing actionable insights to improve gameplay efficiency."}
