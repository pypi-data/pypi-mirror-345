{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-20.0, -70.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -70.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-18.0, -70.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -65.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-21.0, -62.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Burner Inserter at position (-20.5, -66.5) connected to a transport belt and stone furnace\n- Burner Inserter at position (-17.5, -64.5) connected to a wooden chest and stone furnace\n- Wooden Chests at positions (-16.5, -64.5), (-20.5, -63.5), (-13.5, -61.5), (1.5, 0.5), (3.5, 0.5)\n\n### Copper Ore Mining Facility at Position (-23.0, -68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) connected to transport belts and a wooden chest\n- Wooden Chest at position (-23.5, -69.5)\n- Transport Belts forming a network around the mining drill and chest\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Facility at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) connected to a wooden chest and burner inserter\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5) connected to wooden chests and transport belt\n- Wooden Chests at positions (-14.5, -54.5), (-12.5, -54.5)\n- Transport Belt connecting the mining drill and chests\n\n### Coal Mining Facility at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) connected to a wooden chest\n- Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5)\n\n### Belt Networks\n- Multiple belt groups connecting various entities across the map, facilitating the movement of resources between mining drills, furnaces, and chests.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Belts\n- Ensure that transport belts are placed continuously without gaps to connect entities. Verify the alignment and positioning of belts to avoid gaps, as seen in the error at position (-21.5, -65.5).\n\n### Errors with Inserters\n- Ensure that inserters have a clear path to pick up and drop items. Verify that the inserter's source and destination are correctly aligned and stocked with items to process.\n\n### Furnace Warnings\n- Address warnings such as \"furnace result is full\" by ensuring there is a mechanism to remove processed items from furnaces.\n- Ensure furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt to avoid \"no ingredients to smelt\" warnings."}
