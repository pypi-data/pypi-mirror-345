{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) with a stone furnace at position (43.0, -82.0)\n- Iron chests at positions (41.5, -80.5), (42.5, -80.5), (44.5, -80.5), (45.5, -80.5), (47.5, -80.5), and (49.5, -80.5) for coal and iron plate storage\n- Burner inserters at positions (43.5, -80.5) and (41.5, -78.5) for moving items between chests and furnaces\n- Wooden chest at position (41.5, -79.5) for additional coal storage\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) with a stone furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0)\n- Iron chests at positions (-18.5, -48.5), (-16.5, -48.5), (-15.5, -48.5), (-13.5, -49.5), and (-14.5, -47.5) for iron ore storage\n- Wooden chests at positions (-14.5, -48.5), (-12.5, -49.5), and (-9.5, -49.5) for additional storage\n- Stone furnaces at positions (-13.0, -48.0), (-11.0, -48.0), and (-9.0, -48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Extracting Iron Plates from Furnaces\n- Ensure that furnaces have completed smelting before attempting to extract iron plates. Check the furnace status to confirm it is not in a working state.\n\n### Errors when Clearing Drop Chests\n- Verify that the target chest exists and contains the expected items before attempting to clear it. Ensure that the chest is not full or missing.\n\n### Errors when Refueling Entities\n- Check the current fuel status of entities like Burner Mining Drills before refueling to avoid unnecessary actions."}
