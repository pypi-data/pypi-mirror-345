In this case, ensure that a steam engine exists at the specified position (10.0, 0.0) before attempting to access it.\n\n### Repeated Errors\n- The same errors regarding the placement of electric poles and retrieval of steam engines have occurred multiple times. Review the locations and ensure they are valid before attempting to place or retrieve entities."}
