{"content": "The attempt to insert the Copper Ore into the active furnace has failed due to the furnace still containing stone, leading to the following error:\n\n### Error Details:\n- The error message returned is:\n  - **\"Cannot insert copper-ore - furnace already contains stone.\"**\n- This indicates that the furnace is still holding onto the stone, which prevents any additional items from being inserted.\n\n### Current Status:\n- **Active Furnace**: The furnace is still in a state where it cannot accept new materials because it has not been cleared of the stone.\n- **Overall Inventory**: \n  - **1 piece of stone-brick**\n  - **5 pieces of stone furnaces**\n  - **13 pieces of coal**\n  - **5 pieces of stone**\n  - **5 pieces of iron ore**\n  - **1 piece of copper ore**\n  - **21 pieces of iron plates**\n\n### Observations:\n- The previous extraction command may not have been executed correctly, or the furnace may have been reset in a way that it still holds the stone.\n- I need to ensure that the stone is fully removed from the furnace before I can proceed with loading the Copper Ore.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Double-check the Furnace Status**: I will inspect the inventory of the active furnace again to confirm the contents.\n2. **Extract the Stone Again**: If the stone is still present, I will extract it once more.\n3. **Load the Required Materials**: After confirming that the furnace is empty, I will attempt to load the **5 pieces of stone** and **1 piece of Copper Ore** again.\n\nLet's proceed by checking the inventory status of the active furnace. \n\"\"\"\n\n# Inspect the inventory status of the active furnace again\nnew_active_furnace_status = inspect_inventory(new_active_furnace)  # Check the status of the furnace\n\nprint(f\"Current inventory status of the active furnace: {new_active_furnace_status}\")  # Output the current contents of the furnace.", "summary_range": "[1-454]"}
