{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=5.5, y=21.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Steam Engine** at position (x=5.5, y=21.5)\n- **Boiler** at position (x=-1.5, y=24.0)\n- **Offshore Pump** at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\n- **Pipe Group** connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and the boiler to the steam engine with various pipe positions\n- **Electricity Group** with small electric poles at positions (x=1.5, y=14.5), (x=3.5, y=20.5), (x=1.5, y=6.5), (x=1.5, y=10.5), and (x=1.5, y=2.5)\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with copper plates being smelted\n\n### Research Lab at Position (x=2.5, y=0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Lab** at position (x=2.5, y=0.5) currently conducting Automation research\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Insufficient Resources for Crafting\n- Ensure you have enough materials in your inventory before attempting to craft items. For example, copper plates and copper cables are needed for crafting copper cables and small electric poles, respectively.\n\n### Connection Errors with Pipes and Electricity\n- Verify that you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to connect entities. For example, ensure you have pipes and small electric poles when connecting steam engines and labs.\n- Double-check the positions and connections of pipes and poles to ensure they are correctly aligned and connected.\n\n### Entity Not Found Errors\n- Ensure that the entities you are trying to interact with exist at the specified positions. For example, verify the presence of a lab before attempting to check its status or set research.\n\n### Name Errors in Code\n- Double-check variable names and definitions in your code to avoid NameError exceptions. Ensure that all required variables are defined and correctly named.\n\n### Assertion Errors\n- Ensure that all conditions for assertions are met before executing them. For example, verify that the steam engine is working before asserting its status.\n\n### Fuel Management\n- Regularly check and maintain sufficient coal in your inventory to refuel boilers and other fuel-dependent entities to avoid interruptions in energy production."}
