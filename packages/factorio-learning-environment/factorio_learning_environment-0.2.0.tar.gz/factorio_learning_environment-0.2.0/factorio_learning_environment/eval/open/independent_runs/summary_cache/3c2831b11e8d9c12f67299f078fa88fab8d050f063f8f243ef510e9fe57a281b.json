Check and refill fuel regularly to avoid it becoming inactive.\n- Address the issue of the wooden chest being full by either emptying it or creating additional storage to prevent the mining drill from stopping.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items to ensure successful extraction.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity on a tile before attempting to place it, as overlapping entities can cause placement errors.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked yet.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `player_inventory`: dict - Contains items available to the player (e.g., {'wood': 6, 'iron-ore': 412}).\n- `entities_on_map`: list - Represents the current entities on the map, including their positions and statuses."}
