{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) with coal as fuel. It is currently operational and connected to:\n  - **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) which stores extracted iron ore.\n  - **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-15.5, y=-48.5) which is currently empty.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0) fueled by coal. It processes iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5) fueled by coal. It is responsible for moving iron ore from the wooden chest to the stone furnace.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when refueling mining drills\n- Ensure you have enough coal in your inventory before attempting to refuel the mining drill. Harvest coal from nearby coal patches if necessary.\n\n### Errors related to full chests\n- Regularly check and empty the chest at position (-14.5, y=-48.5) to prevent mining operations from halting due to a full chest."}
