{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) for iron ore extraction.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) for storing extracted iron ore.\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) connected to a Stone Furnace at position (41.0, -80.0) for copper ore extraction and smelting.\n- Stone Furnace at position (41.0, -80.0) for smelting copper ore into copper plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (43.5, -79.5) for storing produced copper plates.\n\n### Iron Smelting Facility at Position (41.0, -80.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (41.0, -80.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Copper Smelting Facility at Position (-20.0, -71.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -71.0) for smelting copper ore into copper plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items without sufficient inventory\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into a structure. For instance, attempting to insert coal into a furnace when there is no coal in the inventory will result in an error.\n\n### Errors due to lack of fuel\n- Regularly check fuel levels in mining drills and furnaces to ensure continuous operation. Refill them with the necessary fuel to avoid production halts.\n\n### Errors due to missing ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Without the required input materials, the furnace will not operate.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Defined Utility Functions\n- `insert_item(item_type, target_entity, quantity)`: A function to insert a specified quantity of an item into a target entity. It requires the item to be present in the inventory.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `copper_furnace`: Represents the copper furnace entity where coal is intended to be inserted.\n- `iron_furnace`: Represents the iron furnace entity where coal is intended to be inserted.\n- `iron_mining_drill`: Represents the iron mining drill entity where coal is intended to be inserted.\n- `copper_mining_drill`: Represents the copper mining drill entity where coal is intended to be inserted."}
