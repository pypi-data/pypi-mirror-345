Double-check the coordinates and ensure the entity type matches what is expected.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Verify that the source entities for inserters have items available for transfer. Ensure that the supply chain is not interrupted and that resources are being adequately fed into the system.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Space in Destination\n- Ensure that the destination entities for inserters have enough space to receive items. Regularly clear out processed items to prevent bottlenecks.\n\n### Errors with Undefined Entities\n- When referencing entities, ensure that all necessary definitions and initializations are correctly set up to avoid undefined errors."}
