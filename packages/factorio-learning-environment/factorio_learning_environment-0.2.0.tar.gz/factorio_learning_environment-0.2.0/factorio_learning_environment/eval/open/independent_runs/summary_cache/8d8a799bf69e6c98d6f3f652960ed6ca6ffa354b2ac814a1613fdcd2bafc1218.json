{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Stone Furnace at position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of a furnace used for smelting purposes. The furnace receives coal, iron ore, and additional ingredients to produce iron plates, which are later extracted. All interactions including ingredient insertions and iron plate extractions are centered at this structure.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 Furnace smelting delays \u2013 When the furnace times out or produces fewer iron plates than expected, verify that the correct quantities of the required ingredients (coal and iron ore) are correctly supplied before initiating smelting.\n\u2022 Inventory mismatch during insertion \u2013 Ensure that sufficient resources are present in the inventory prior to executing the insert_item operation to avoid missing resource errors.\n\u2022 Assertion failures on product quantity \u2013 Validate the expected yield (e.g., iron plates) in the furnace output against the set requirements to prevent assertion errors during extraction operations."}
