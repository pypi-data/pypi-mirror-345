The agent's inventory contains various items, but none have been deployed to form any structures.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities on non-buildable tiles\n- Ensure that the tile is buildable before attempting to place an entity. Check the terrain and any existing entities that might block placement.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing. This includes checking for any existing entities or terrain features that might obstruct placement.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items. This ensures that the extraction action is within the effective range.\n\n### General Placement Errors\n- Review the environment and ensure that the placement coordinates are valid and not obstructed by other entities or terrain features. This includes ensuring that the position is within the buildable area of the map."}
