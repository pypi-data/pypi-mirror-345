{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner mining drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) for extracting iron ore.\n- **Stone furnace** at position (-13.0, -50.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Wooden chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5) for storing iron ore.\n- **Stone furnace** at position (-15.0, -47.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Stone furnace** at position (-13.0, -47.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Stone furnace** at position (-15.0, -45.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner inserter** at position (-16.5, -44.5) for transferring items between entities.\n- **Burner inserter** at position (-13.5, -44.5) for transferring items between entities.\n\n#### Coal Mining Facility at position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner mining drill** at position (41.0, -82.0) for extracting coal.\n- **Wooden chest** at position (41.5, -80.5) for storing coal.\n\n---\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when inserting items without sufficient inventory\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into furnaces or other entities. Repeatedly attempting to insert iron ore without having any in your inventory caused multiple errors.\n\n#### Errors when smelting without ingredients\n- Ensure furnaces have the necessary ingredients (e.g., iron ore) before attempting to smelt. Furnaces at positions (-13.0, -47.0) and (-15.0, -45.0) are currently idle due to a lack of ingredients.\n\n#### Errors when extracting items\n- Verify that the target entity (e.g., chest or furnace) has items available before attempting extraction. This prevents unnecessary errors and ensures smooth operation.\n\n#### General tips for inventory management\n- Regularly check your inventory to ensure you have the necessary resources for crafting and inserting items. This will help avoid errors related to insufficient items.\n\n#### Errors when inserting coal into drills\n- Ensure that the coal drill at position (41.0, -82.0) has sufficient coal before attempting to insert more. Overloading the drill with coal can lead to inefficiencies and errors.\n\n#### Errors when crafting without sufficient materials\n- Ensure you have enough iron plates in your inventory before attempting to craft iron gear wheels. This will prevent errors and ensure continuous production.\n\n#### Errors when inserting into furnaces without sufficient fuel\n- Ensure that furnaces have sufficient coal or other fuel sources before attempting to smelt. Furnaces at positions (-13.0, -50.0) and (-15.0, -47.0) are currently idle due to insufficient fuel.\n\n#### Errors when inserting into furnaces without ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients (e.g., iron ore) before attempting to smelt. Furnaces at positions (-13.0, -47.0) and (-15.0, -45.0) are currently idle due to a lack of ingredients.\n\n#### Errors when inserting into furnaces without sufficient space\n- Ensure that furnaces have sufficient space in their output inventory before attempting to smelt. Furnaces at positions (-13.0, -50.0) and (-15.0, -47.0) are currently idle due to insufficient space in their output inventory."}
