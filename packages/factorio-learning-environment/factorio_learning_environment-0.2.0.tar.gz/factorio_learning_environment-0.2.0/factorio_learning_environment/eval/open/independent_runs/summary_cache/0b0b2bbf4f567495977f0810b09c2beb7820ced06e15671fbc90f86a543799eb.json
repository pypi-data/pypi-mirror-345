{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-14.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-14.0, -49.0)\n  - Fueled with coal\n  - Current inventory: 6 iron plates\n  - Status: No ingredients to smelt\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Setup at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-16.0, -51.0)\n  - Fueled with coal\n  - Connected to a wooden chest at position (-16.5, -52.5)\n  - Status: Working, but chest at drop position is full\n\n### Ore Collection System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-16.5, -52.5)\n  - Inventory: 1 iron ore\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Crafting and Inventory Management\n- Ensure that all necessary resources are available in the inventory before attempting to craft items. For example, crafting a stone furnace requires stone, and crafting a burner mining drill requires iron plates, iron gear wheels, and a stone furnace.\n\n### Errors in Placing Entities\n- Verify that the item to be placed is available in the inventory before attempting to place it. For instance, placing a burner mining drill or a wooden chest failed due to the absence of these items in the inventory.\n\n### Errors in Type Handling\n- Ensure that the correct data types are used in function calls. For example, when creating a building box, ensure that the width and height parameters are integers or convertible to integers.\n\n### Errors in Fuel Management\n- Before attempting to insert fuel into a mining drill or furnace, confirm that the fuel (e.g., coal) is available in the inventory.\n\n### Errors in Resource Extraction\n- Ensure that the target entity for resource extraction is not full and has space to accommodate additional resources. For example, the wooden chest connected to the burner mining drill was full, preventing further mining.\n\n### Errors in Code Logic\n- Ensure that variables are defined before use. For instance, the variable 'crafted' was used without being defined, leading to a NameError."}
