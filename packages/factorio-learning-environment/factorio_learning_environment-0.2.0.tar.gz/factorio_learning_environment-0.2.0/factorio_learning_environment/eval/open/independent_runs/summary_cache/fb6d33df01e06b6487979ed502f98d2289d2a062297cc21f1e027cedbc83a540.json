{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at position (-15.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -49.0) with a fuel inventory of 2 coal and currently holding 59 iron plates. The furnace is currently in a \"NO_INGREDIENTS\" status indicating it lacks raw materials to continue production.\n\n### Coal Mining Site at position (42.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (42.0, -83.0) with a fuel inventory of 5 coal. The drill is currently in a \"WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION\" status due to an output blockage, indicating there is no sink entity to accept the output.\n\n### Wooden Chest for Coal Collection at position (200.5, -80.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (200.5, -80.5) with an empty inventory. The chest is intended to collect coal.\n\n### Additional Storage at position (0.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (0.5, 0.5) with an empty inventory.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing Wooden Chests\n- Ensure there is a valid, unoccupied tile before attempting to place a Wooden Chest. Avoid attempting to place chests in already occupied spaces.\n\n### Errors related to buildable area validation\n- When defining dimensions for buildable areas, ensure that height and width are valid integers. Avoid using non-integer values or incorrect data types.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient inventory\n- Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to place or craft entities. For instance, ensure you have enough wood to craft a Wooden Chest before attempting to place one.\n\n### Errors when using transport belts\n- Verify that transport belts are correctly defined and connected. Ensure that the entity names are correctly referenced and that belts are connected to appropriate entities using inserters if necessary.\n\n### Errors when placing Burner Inserters\n- Ensure that the intended position for placing a Burner Inserter is valid and unoccupied. Check for any obstructions before placement.\n\n### Errors with output blockage\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity (such as a chest or belt) to accept the output from mining drills to prevent blockage and ensure continuous operation."}
