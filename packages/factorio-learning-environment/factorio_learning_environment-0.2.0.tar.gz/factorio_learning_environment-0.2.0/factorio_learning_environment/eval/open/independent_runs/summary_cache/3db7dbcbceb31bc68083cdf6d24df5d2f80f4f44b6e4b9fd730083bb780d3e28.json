{"content": "# Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) extracting iron ore, with neighbours:\n  - **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n  - **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-15.5, y=-48.5)\n  - **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5)\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) transferring iron ore to:\n  - **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0) for smelting iron ore, with inventory of iron plates.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-10.0, y=-48.0) currently inactive, awaiting ingredients.\n\n### Storage Facility\nConsists of multiple **Wooden Chests** for storing iron plates:\n- Chest at position (x=-7.5, y=-48.5) with inventory of 60 iron plates.\n- Chest at position (x=-6.5, y=-48.5) with inventory of 1500 iron plates.\n- Chest at position (x=-6.5, y=-49.5) with inventory of 1500 iron plates.\n- Chest at position (x=-5.5, y=-48.5) with inventory of 1500 iron plates.\n- Chest at position (x=-4.5, y=-48.5) with inventory of 62 iron plates.\n- Chest at position (x=-3.5, y=-48.5) empty.\n- Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-46.5) with inventory of 750 iron ore and 1 iron plate.\n\n### Inserter Network\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5) waiting for source items.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-11.5, y=-46.5) waiting for source items, transferring between furnaces.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-8.5, y=-47.5) waiting for source items, transferring from chest to furnace.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-11.5, y=-45.5) waiting for source items, transferring between inserters.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entity has items available for the inserter to pick up. Regularly check and replenish the source inventory to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### No Ingredients to Smelt in Furnace\n- Ensure that furnaces have a continuous supply of raw materials (iron ore) to smelt. This can be achieved by maintaining a steady flow of resources from mining drills to furnaces.\n\n### Out of Fuel in Burner Mining Drill\n- Regularly refuel burner mining drills to ensure continuous operation. Monitor fuel levels and replenish coal as needed to prevent downtime."}
