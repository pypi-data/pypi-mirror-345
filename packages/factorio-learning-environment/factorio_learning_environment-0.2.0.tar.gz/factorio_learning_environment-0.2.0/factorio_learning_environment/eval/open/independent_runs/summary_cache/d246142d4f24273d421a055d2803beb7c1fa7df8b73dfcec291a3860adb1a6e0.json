{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Plate Factory at position (0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Setup at position (42, -83)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (42.0, -83.0)\n- Wooden chest at position (42.5, -81.5)\n- Burner inserter at position (42.5, -80.5) that waits for source items\n- Burner inserter at position (43.5, -81.5) that waits for space in destination\n\n### Coal Storage at position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest at position (-14.5, -48.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n- **Errors when using burner mining drill without fuel**\n  - Ensure that the burner mining drill is supplied with fuel before attempting to operate it.\n\n- **Errors when wooden chest is empty**\n  - Check the inventory of the wooden chest regularly to ensure it has the necessary resources, such as iron ore, before relying on it for crafting or processing.\n\n- **Errors when inserters are waiting for source items**\n  - Make sure that the source items are available in the designated location for the inserters to function properly.\n\n- **Errors when inserters are waiting for space in destination**\n  - Ensure that the destination (e.g., chest or machine) has enough space to accept items before attempting to insert them.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - `checkFuelStatus()`: Checks if the burner mining drill has fuel. Failure occurs if the drill is out of fuel.\n  - `checkChestInventory()`: Checks the inventory of the wooden chest. Failure occurs if the chest is empty.\n  \n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `burnerMiningDrillPosition`: Tuple (float, float) - Position of the burner mining drill.\n  - `woodenChestInventory`: Dictionary - Inventory of the wooden chest.\n  - `stoneFurnaceStatus`: String - Status of the stone furnace (e.g., NO_FUEL).\n  - `burnerInserterStatus`: String - Status of the burner inserter (e.g., WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS)."}
