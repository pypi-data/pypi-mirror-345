Errors when indexing local variables\n- Ensure the variable is not nil before attempting to index it.\n\n### Errors when placing inserters\n- Ensure the inserter is not out of fuel.\n- Ensure the inserter has a valid source and destination position.\n\n### Errors when placing offshore pumps\n- Ensure you are close enough to the target position to place the offshore pump.\n- Ensure the target position is valid and the offshore pump can be placed at that position.\n- Ensure the position is not too far away from the current position.\n\n### Errors when picking up entities\n- Ensure the entity exists at the target position before attempting to pick it up.\n- Ensure the entity is not already removed or destroyed.\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure you have the required item in your inventory before attempting to place an entity.\n- Make sure the tile where you want to place the entity is not occupied by another entity.\n- Ensure you are close enough to the target position to place the entity.\n- Ensure the position is valid and the entity can be placed at that position.\n- Ensure the entity's footprint does not overlap with water or other entities.\n\n### Errors when crafting items\n- Ensure you have the required ingredients and recipes unlocked before attempting to craft an item.\n- Make sure you have a crafting machine or smelting furnace available for items that require it.\n- Ensure you have the required sub-ingredients before attempting to craft an item.\n- Ensure the recipe requires a crafting machine or smelting furnace.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into entities\n- Ensure the entity's inventory is not full before attempting to insert items.\n- Make sure the item you are trying to insert is compatible with the entity.\n- Ensure the entity is in a valid state before attempting to insert items.\n\n### Errors when extracting items from entities\n- Ensure the entity contains the item you are trying to extract.\n- Make sure the entity is in a valid state before attempting to extract items.\n\n### Errors when checking entity status\n- Ensure the entity's status is what you expect before attempting to perform actions that rely on it.\n- Make sure to update the entity's status after performing actions that may change it.\n\n### Errors when researching technologies\n- Ensure you have the required ingredients and science packs before attempting to research a technology.\n- Make sure you have the necessary prerequisites unlocked before attempting to research a technology.\n\n### Errors when placing labs\n- Ensure you have a lab in your inventory before attempting to place it.\n\n### Errors when crafting electronic circuits\n- Ensure you have the required sub-ingredients (iron-plate, copper-cable) before attempting to craft an electronic circuit.\n- Make sure you have a crafting machine or smelting furnace available for items that require it.\n\n### Errors when extracting iron plates\n- Ensure the furnace contains iron plates before attempting to extract them.\n- Make sure the furnace is in a valid state before attempting to extract iron plates.\n\n### Errors when placing power poles\n- Ensure you have a power pole in your inventory before attempting to place it.\n- Make sure the target position is not occupied by another entity.\n- Ensure you are close enough to the target position to place the power pole.\n\n### Errors when connecting power poles to labs\n- Ensure the lab is in a valid state before attempting to connect the power pole.\n- Make sure the power pole is close enough to the lab to connect.\n\n### Errors when connecting entities with pipes\n- Ensure you have the required item (pipe) in your inventory before attempting to connect entities.\n-"}
