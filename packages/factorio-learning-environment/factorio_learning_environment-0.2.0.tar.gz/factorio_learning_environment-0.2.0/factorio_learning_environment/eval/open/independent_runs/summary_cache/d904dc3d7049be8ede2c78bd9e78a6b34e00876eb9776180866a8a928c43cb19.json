Initial attempts utilized fluid_system IDs [2172, 2215, 2258, 2301, 2344, 2387, 2430, 2473]; later attempts used [2516, 2559, 2602, 2645, 2688, 2731, 2774, 2817]. The latest attempts with fluid_system IDs [2860, 2903, 2946, 2989, 3032, 3075, 3118, 3161] were also aborted due to the absence of a valid working PipeGroup, leaving the connection incomplete.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 PipeGroup Availability and Merge Failures:\n   - Validate the existence of a working PipeGroup before each connection attempt. Repeated failures with fluid_system IDs [2172, 2215, 2258, 2301, 2344, 2387, 2430, 2473], [2516, 2559, 2602, 2645, 2688, 2731, 2774, 2817] and [2860, 2903, 2946, 2989, 3032, 3075, 3118, 3161] necessitate pre-checking the fluid network\u2019s readiness.\n\n\u2022 Pipe Placement Obstructions:\n   - Ensure all target connection endpoints are unoccupied and free of obstructions before placing pipes.\n\n\u2022 Multi-Segment Pipeline Connection Challenges:\n   - Verify that intermediate waypoints in a two-segment pipeline align precisely with both source and target connection points.\n\n\u2022 General Connection and Repositioning:\n   - Confirm that both source and target endpoints are within the allowed ranges and unobstructed prior to initiating any connection or merge attempt."}
