{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) with a drop position at (40.5, -83.5), extracting coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (40.5, -83.5) storing coal (225 units).\n- Wooden Chest at position (42.5, -83.5) storing coal (181 units).\n- Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -83.5) storing iron plates (82 units).\n\n### Iron and Copper Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Burner Inserter at position (1.5, 0.5) transferring items from the stone furnace to a wooden chest at position (2.5, 0.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (2.5, 0.5) with no inventory.\n- Burner Inserter at position (3.5, 0.5) transferring items from the wooden chest at position (2.5, 0.5) to a transport belt.\n- Wooden Chest at position (7.5, 0.5) storing iron plates (1052 units) and copper plates (450 units).\n- Burner Inserter at position (6.5, 0.5) transferring items from the wooden chest at position (7.5, -0.5) to the wooden chest at position (7.5, 0.5).\n- Burner Inserter at position (8.5, 0.5) transferring items from the wooden chest at position (7.5, 0.5) to the stone furnace at position (10.0, 0.0).\n- Stone Furnace at position (10.0, 0.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Burner Inserter at position (11.5, 0.5) transferring items from the stone furnace at position (10.0, 0.0) to a wooden chest at position (12.5, 0.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (12.5, 0.5) storing copper plates (744 units).\n\n### Transport Belt System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- BeltGroup connecting the wooden chest at position (2.5, 0.5) to the burner inserter at position (6.5, 0.5).\n- Belt from position (40.5, -83.5) to (38.5, -83.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Extracting Items\n- Ensure that the target chest is not full or blocked before attempting to extract items.\n\n### Errors when Refueling Inserters\n- Ensure that inserters have sufficient fuel to operate. Regularly check and refuel inserters at positions (1.5, 0.5), (3.5, 0.5), (6.5, 0.5), (8.5, 0.5), and (11.5, 0.5).\n\n### Errors when Managing Source Items for Inserters\n- Verify that there is a nearby entity that can accept the items being managed by the inserter. Ensure proper alignment and connectivity between inserters and their target entities.\n\n### Errors when Crafting Wooden Chests\n- Ensure that all necessary materials are available in the inventory before attempting to craft wooden chests."}
