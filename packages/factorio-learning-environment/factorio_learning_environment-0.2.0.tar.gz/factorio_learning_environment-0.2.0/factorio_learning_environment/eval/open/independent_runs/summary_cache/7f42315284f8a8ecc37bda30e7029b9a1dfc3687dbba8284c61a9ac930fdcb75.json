{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) with a drop position at (-14.5, -48.5). The mining drill is working and fueled with coal.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-14.0, -48.0) aligned directly with the mining drill's drop position. The furnace is fueled and has produced iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-14.5, -46.5) to transfer iron ore from the mining drill to the furnace. The inserter is fueled with coal and positioned to facilitate the transfer of resources.\n\n### Additional Stone Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0) is present but currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied or restricted tiles\n- Ensure you can place an entity in a tile before attempting placement. Consider increasing spacing, changing direction, or altering the reference position to avoid collisions with existing entities or restricted areas.\n\n### Errors due to misalignment of inserter and mining drill\n- Verify alignment between inserter pickup/drop positions and the mining drill's drop position to ensure efficient resource transfer. Adjust positions as necessary to correct misalignment.\n\n### Errors when attempting to insert items without inventory stock\n- Check inventory stock before attempting to insert items into entities to ensure the required items are available for insertion."}
