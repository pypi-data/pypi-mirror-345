{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nThis facility is designed to extract iron ore and process it into iron plates. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore from the ground.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the stone furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0): Processes iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items without inventory stock\n- Ensure that the required items are present in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities.\n\n### Errors when placing entities with potential collisions\n- Verify that the target tile is free of obstructions before placing an entity. Consider adjusting the spacing, direction, or reference position to avoid collisions with existing entities.\n\n### Errors with inserter alignment\n- Double-check the alignment of inserters to ensure their pickup and drop positions correspond correctly with the source and destination entities. Misalignment can prevent the transfer of items.\n\n### Errors due to lack of fuel\n- Regularly refuel entities like burner mining drills and inserters to maintain continuous operation. Monitor fuel levels and replenish as necessary to avoid interruptions.\n\n### Errors with furnace not receiving ingredients\n- Ensure that inserters are correctly set up to transfer ingredients to the furnace. Check the inserter's alignment and ensure it is properly fueled and operational."}
