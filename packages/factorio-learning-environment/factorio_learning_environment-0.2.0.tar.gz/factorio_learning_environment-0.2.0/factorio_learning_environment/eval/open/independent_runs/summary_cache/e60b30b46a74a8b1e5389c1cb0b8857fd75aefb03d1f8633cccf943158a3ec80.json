{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at Position (-39.5, -71.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position unknown) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-39.5, -71.5) for collecting copper ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -71.0) for smelting copper ore into copper plates.\n\n### Iron Plate Mine at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) for collecting iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (41.0, -80.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Idle Entities\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) with no fuel and not producing due to lack of resources.\n- Stone Furnace at position (41.0, -80.0) with no fuel and no ingredients to smelt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Crafting Due to Missing Resources\n- Ensure all required raw resources are gathered before attempting to craft items. For example, gather wood before crafting wooden chests.\n\n### Errors in Resource Gathering and Placement\n- Verify that resource patches exist at specified locations before attempting to gather resources. For example, ensure iron ore is present at the location before using `get_resource_patch`.\n- Ensure proper positioning of chests relative to mining drills to collect resources effectively.\n\n### Errors in Inventory Management\n- Check inventory levels before attempting to insert items into entities. For example, ensure coal is available in the inventory before inserting it into furnaces or drills.\n\n### Errors in Fuel Management\n- Regularly refuel mining drills and furnaces to maintain production efficiency. Monitor fuel levels to avoid production halts.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `craft_item`: Used for crafting items. Ensure all sub-ingredients are available before invocation to prevent crafting failures.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `crafted_chests`: List of crafted wooden chests, requires wood as a sub-ingredient.\n- `iron_ore_patch`: Represents a resource patch for iron ore, ensure it points to a valid location with resources."}
