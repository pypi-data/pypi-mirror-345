Verify that the specified fluid_system ID corresponds to a working and properly configured PipeGroup before initiating connection operations.\n\n\u2022 Fixed Delay Limitations for Pipeline Stabilization:\n   - A fixed 10-second delay after each connection attempt has not ensured pipeline stability. Implement dynamic readiness checks to confirm that the pipeline network is stabilized prior to retrying connection operations."}
