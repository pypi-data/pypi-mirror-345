{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll generate a comprehensive report:\n\n# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing System (around x=41-45, y=-80 to -83)\nComplex system consisting of:\n- Burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0) mining coal\n- Storage chest system:\n  - Iron chest at (41.5, -83.5) storing coal (overflow storage)\n  - Wooden chest at (41.5, -80.5) as intermediate storage\n- Transport system:\n  - Burner inserter at (42.5, -80.5) facing RIGHT, moving coal from wooden chest to belt\n  - Transport belt at (43.5, -80.5) facing RIGHT\n  - Burner inserter at (43.5, -81.5) facing RIGHT, moving coal to furnace\n- Processing:\n  - Stone furnace at (45.0, -81.0)\n  - Additional stone furnace at (47.0, -81.0)\n\n### Iron Plate Storage\n- Wooden chest at (49.5, -80.5) containing iron plates\n\n### Transport Belt System\n- Belt group running from (42.5, -68.5) to (42.5, -77.5)\n- Additional belt at (43.5, -80.5) facing RIGHT\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Conflicts\n- Before placing entities, verify there is sufficient clear space at the target location\n- Multiple attempts to place burner-inserter failed due to existing objects at positions:\n  - (43.5, -81.0)\n  - (44.5, -80.5)\n  - (44.5, -81.0)\n\n### Transport System Bottlenecks\n- Transport belt blocking detected at (43.5, -80.5)\n- Clear blocked belts to maintain proper material flow\n\n### Resource Management\n- Monitor furnace ingredient supply - multiple furnaces showing \"no ingredients to smelt\" warning\n- Furnace fuel sources are full but not processing - check input material flow\n\n# NAMESPACE\n\n### Variables\n- `furnace_inserter`: Entity (burner-inserter)\n- `mining_drill`: Entity (burner-mining-drill)\n- `coal_chest`: Entity (wooden-chest)\n- `chest_inserter`: Entity (burner-inserter)\n- `belt_right`: Entity (transport-belt)\n- `furnace`: Entity (stone-furnace)\n\n### Entity States\n- `EntityStatus.WORKING`: Mining drill operational state\n- `EntityStatus.WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION`: Inserter blocked state\n- `EntityStatus.WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS`: Inserter waiting for materials\n- `EntityStatus.NO_INGREDIENTS`: Furnace waiting state\n- `EntityStatus.NORMAL`: Default operational state"}
