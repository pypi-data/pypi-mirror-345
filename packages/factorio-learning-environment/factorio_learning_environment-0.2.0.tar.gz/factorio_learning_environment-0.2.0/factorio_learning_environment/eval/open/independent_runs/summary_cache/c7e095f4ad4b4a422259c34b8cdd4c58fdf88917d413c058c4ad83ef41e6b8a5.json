Shared Smelting Furnaces Automation Network  \n   Purpose: Automates furnace operations by linking smelting units with inserters, chests, and transport belts.  \n   Consists of:  \n   \u2022 Stone furnaces at positions (0.0, 0.0) and (5.0, 0.0)  \n   \u2022 Burner\u2011inserters at various positions (e.g., (\u201314.5, \u201352.5), (\u201313.5, \u201352.5), etc.)  \n   \u2022 Wooden chests at positions such as (\u201313.5, \u201351.5), (\u201311.5, \u201346.5), (1.5, 1.5), (2.5, 0.5) and (0.5, 2.5)  \n   \u2022 Multiple BeltGroups routing materials among these entities\n\n2. Iron Ore Mining Automation Setup  \n   Purpose: Facilitates automated extraction and routing of iron ore.  \n   Consists of:  \n   \u2022 A burner\u2011mining drill positioned at (\u201315.0, \u201350.0)  \n   \u2022 Allied inserters, chests, and transport belts integrated in its network\n\n3. Steam Power Generation System  \n   Purpose: Supplies power by converting water and fuel into steam energy.  \n   Consists of:  \n   \u2022 A boiler at (8.0, 20.5) with connection points at (8.5, 18.5) and (8.5, 22.5)  \n   \u2022 Steam engines installed at positions (0.5, 9.5), (18.5, 11.5), (1.5, 13.5), (13.5, 14.5), (19.5, 14.5), (22.5, 18.5), (17.5, 20.5), (12.5, 21.5) and (4.5, 23.5)  \n   \u2022 An extra steam engine remains unplaced due to spatial congestion; overlapping burner\u2011inserters and misaligned transport belts in the boiler area have prevented establishment of a clear buildable zone. Recent diagnostics confirm that this issue persists.\n\n4. Automation Research Lab  \n   Purpose: Enables research on automation science packs.  \n   Consists of:  \n   \u2022 Lab units that are in place but continue to experience NO_POWER connectivity issues\n\n5. Electrical, Transport, and Fluid Infrastructure  \n   Purpose: Provides an integrated backbone for power distribution, material routing, and fluid handling.  \n   Consists of:  \n   \u2022 ElectricityGroups, BeltGroups, and PipeGroups that interlink various production and processing entities\n\n6. Offshore Pump and Fluid Network  \n   Purpose: Ensures a reliable water supply for fluid-dependent processes.  \n   Consists of:  \n   \u2022 An offshore pump at (0.5, 30.5)  \n   \u2022 Multiple PipeGroups conveying water throughout the network\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 Extra Steam Engine Placement Issue  \n  - The extra steam engine remains unplaceable due to persistent spatial congestion in the boiler zone centered at (8.0, 20.5), where overlapping burner\u2011inserters and misaligned transport belts inhibit a clear buildable area.  \n  - Interfering remnants near the connection point (8.5, 22.5) continue to block adequate clearance despite sufficient inventory.  \n  - Immediate manual intervention is required: thoroughly reassess and clear the entire boiler zone and its adjoining connection interfaces, remove or reposition conflicting entities, and consider relocating the extra steam engine or redesigning the boiler layout.\n\n\u2022 Fuel Supply and Connectivity Issues  \n  - Burner\u2011inserters and mining drills are frequently reported as \"out of fuel\" or \"waiting for source items\".  \n  - Ensure that fuel providers are placed immediately adjacent to these machines and that the transport belt routing remains unobstructed.\n\n\u2022 Steam Engine and Fluid Connection Deficiencies  \n  - Several steam engines are flagged as not connected to the power network and lack proper input liquid in their fluid connections.  \n  - Verify and reconfigure both electrical wiring and fluid pipeline connections to secure an adequate supply.\n\n\u2022 Laboratory Power Instability  \n  - Lab units continue to display NO_POWER errors.  \n  - Inspect and adjust the surrounding electrical infrastructure, including pole placements and wiring, to restore stable power to the research lab."}
