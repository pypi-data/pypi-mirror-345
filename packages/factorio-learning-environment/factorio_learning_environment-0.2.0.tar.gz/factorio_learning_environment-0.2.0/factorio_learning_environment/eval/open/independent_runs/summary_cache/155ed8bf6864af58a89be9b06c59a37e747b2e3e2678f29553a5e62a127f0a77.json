It has been refueled and now reports a status of FULL_OUTPUT (current fuel level updated, e.g. Inventory({'coal': 3})).\n- Offshore pump at position(-9.5, 24.5) for water extraction; connection point at (-9.5, 23.5).\n- Steam engine at position(2.5, 21.5) for electricity generation; currently NOT_CONNECTED with warnings indicating \u201cnot connected to power network\u201d, \u201cno input liquid\u201d and \u201cno fluid present in connections\u201d.\n- Pipeline Network: Multiple segmented pipeline reconnection attempts have been undertaken\u2014including clearing contaminated pipes (e.g. at (-2.5, 22.5)) and employing alternative intermediate waypoints (e.g. at (-3.0, 23.0), (-7.0, 24.5), (-4.0, 24.5), (-0.5, 23.5) and L-shaped configurations). Although some individual segments have succeeded, full connectivity between the boiler\u2019s output and the steam engine remains unestablished.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 Connection and Repositioning Errors:\n\u2003\u2013 Repeated failures to connect pipeline segments indicate that source and target connection points may be misaligned or obstructed. Verify that each connection point is free, properly positioned, and compatible before establishing links.\n\n\u2022 Fluid Mismatch and Contamination:\n\u2003\u2013 Errors citing unexpected fluid content (e.g. water in a steam-designated pipe or surplus fluids) require that contaminated or extraneous fluids be fully cleared. Ensure that every segment contains only the fluid type required by the receiving entity.\n\n\u2022 Multi-Segment Pipeline Construction Challenges:\n\u2003\u2013 Segmented and L-shaped connection attempts are failing due to misaligned intermediate waypoints or mismatches in fluid flow. Adjust waypoint positions carefully and verify compatibility at each segment transition.\n\n\u2022 Inventory and Resource Management:\n\u2003\u2013 Encountered insertion failures (e.g. no coal available during boiler refueling) and insufficient pipe inventory errors necessitate pre-checking resource counts prior to execution of actions that depend on specific inventory items.\n\n\u2022 General Placement and Stabilization:\n\u2003\u2013 Frequent repositioning conflicts and hurried reconnection attempts have resulted in cumulative errors. Allow sufficient stabilization time after clearing or modifying pipeline segments and ensure target areas are unobstructed before reattempting connections."}
