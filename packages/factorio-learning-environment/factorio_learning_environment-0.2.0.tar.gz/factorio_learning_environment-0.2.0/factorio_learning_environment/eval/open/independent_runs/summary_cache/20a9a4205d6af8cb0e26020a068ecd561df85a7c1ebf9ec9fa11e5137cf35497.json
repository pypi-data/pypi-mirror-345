{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=7.5, y=39.5)\n- Consists of:\n  - Steam Engine at position (x=7.5, y=39.5)\n  - Boiler at position (x=0.5, y=28.0)\n  - Note: The steam engine is currently not operational due to connection issues between the boiler and the steam engine.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors in Connecting Boiler to Steam Engine\n- Ensure that the pipe connections between the boiler at (x=0.5, y=28.0) and the steam engine at (x=7.5, y=39.5) are correctly established. Check for any obstructions or incorrect placements that might be preventing the connection.\n\n### Repeated Operational Failures\n- The steam engine remains non-operational. Verify that all necessary components are correctly placed and connected. Ensure that the boiler is adequately fueled and that the steam engine is properly linked to the boiler.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- No utility functions or important variables have been defined or invoked in the given steps."}
