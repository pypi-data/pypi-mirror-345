{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) with a drop position at (-14.5, -48.5). This drill extracts iron ore and places it into a wooden chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5) used to store extracted iron ore.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (-13.0, -48.0), (-11.0, -48.0), and (-9.0, -48.0). These furnaces are used to smelt iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserters** at positions (-14.5, -46.5) and (-14.5, -45.5) used to transfer items between entities, currently waiting for source items.\n- **Iron Chest** at position (-14.5, -47.5) used as an intermediary storage.\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (41.0, -82.0) with a drop position at (41.5, -80.5). This drill extracts coal and places it into an iron chest.\n- **Iron Chest** at position (41.5, -80.5) used to store extracted coal.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (43.0, -82.0) used to smelt items, currently with no ingredients to smelt.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (43.5, -80.5) used to transfer items between entities, currently waiting for source items.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (41.5, -79.5) used as an intermediary storage.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when extracting iron ore from a chest\n- Ensure that the wooden chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) contains iron ore before attempting to extract. Check the inventory of the chest to confirm the presence of iron ore.\n\n### Inserters waiting for source items\n- Ensure that the source entities for inserters at positions (43.5, -80.5), (-14.5, -46.5), and (-14.5, -45.5) have items available for transfer. Check the connected entities to ensure they are producing or have items to be moved.\n\n### Warnings about full chests\n- Regularly check the chests at positions (41.5, -80.5) and (-14.5, -48.5) to ensure they are not full. Empty them periodically to maintain continuous operation of mining drills."}
