{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0): Responsible for extracting iron ore. Currently out of fuel and unable to continue mining due to a full chest at its drop position.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5): Stores extracted iron ore. Currently contains 11 units of iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5): Transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the stone furnace. It is currently fueled with coal but waiting for source items.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates. Currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Insufficient Fuel Management\n- Ensure that there is enough coal in the inventory to refuel all necessary entities such as mining drills and inserters. Regularly check fuel levels and replenish as needed to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Incorrect Crafting Attempts\n- Avoid attempting to craft raw resources like coal. These resources must be gathered directly from the environment rather than crafted.\n\n### Inserter Alignment and Setup\n- Verify the alignment and setup of inserters to ensure they are correctly positioned to transfer items between entities. Reposition and align inserters as necessary to maintain efficient item flow.\n\n### Chest Management\n- Regularly monitor and manage chest inventories to prevent them from becoming full, which can halt production processes. Extract items from chests to free up space and ensure continuous operation of connected entities.\n\n### Furnace Operation\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Regularly check and supply the required raw materials to avoid idle furnaces."}
