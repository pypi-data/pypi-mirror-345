{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at Position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0) with fuel inventory containing coal. It is operational but has a warning: \"output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\"\n- **Stone Furnace** at Position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0) with fuel inventory containing coal. It is currently not producing due to a lack of ingredients, with a warning: \"no ingredients to smelt.\"\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied locations\n- Ensure that the target tile is free of other entities or items before attempting to place a new entity. This will prevent errors such as \"Cannot place Wooden Chest at the desired location\" or \"Cannot place Burner Inserter at the desired location.\"\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities from incorrect positions\n- Verify the existence and position of entities before attempting to interact with them. This will avoid errors like \"Could not get Prototype.StoneFurnace at position x=-16.5 y=-53.0.\"\n\n### Errors due to lack of resources\n- Ensure that you have the necessary resources in your inventory before attempting to insert them into machines or other entities. This will prevent errors such as \"Could not insert: No coal to insert from your inventory.\"\n\n### Errors with blocked outputs\n- Make sure that the output of a machine, such as a mining drill, is connected to a valid sink entity (e.g., a furnace or a transport belt) to prevent output blockage warnings."}
