{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-19.0, -65.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -65.0), currently working with a source of iron ore and producing iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-21.5, -65.5) storing coal and iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-20.5, -65.5) transferring materials between the chest and the furnace.\n\n### Coal Mining Setup at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0), currently out of fuel, extracting coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5) storing extracted coal.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Setup at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0), currently out of fuel, extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -54.5) storing extracted iron ore.\n\n### Smelting Facility at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0), currently out of ingredients, previously smelting iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5) for storage.\n- Burner Inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) for transferring items between entities.\n\n### Transport Belt System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- BeltGroup connecting the mining drill at position (-25.0, -64.0) to the stone furnace at position (-23.0, -66.0).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Space\n- Ensure that the destination entity has enough space to accommodate the items being transferred by the inserter. Consider adding additional storage or managing inventory levels to prevent blockage.\n\n### Inserter Output Blocked\n- Check for any items on the ground that might be blocking the output of the inserter. Ensure there is a sink entity in place to accept the output from the inserter.\n\n### Fuel Management for Mining Drills\n- Regularly refuel burner mining drills to prevent them from running out of fuel and halting resource extraction. Consider setting up a more efficient fuel supply chain to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Smelting Facility Lacking Ingredients\n- Ensure that the smelting facility has a continuous supply of raw materials to maintain production. Consider optimizing the supply chain to prevent interruptions in the smelting process."}
