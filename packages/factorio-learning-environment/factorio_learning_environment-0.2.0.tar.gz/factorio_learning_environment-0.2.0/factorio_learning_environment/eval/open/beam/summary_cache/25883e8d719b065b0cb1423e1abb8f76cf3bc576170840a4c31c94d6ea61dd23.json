{"content": "Ah, I apologize - you're right. Wooden chests need wood which is a raw resource. Let's modify our approach to use an iron chest instead, which we can craft from iron plates.\n\n```python\n# Remove extra inserters first (keep drill)\ndrill = get_entities({Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill})[0]\nfor inserter in get_entities({Prototype.BurnerInserter}):\n    pickup_entity(Prototype.BurnerInserter, inserter.position)\n\n# Craft an iron chest for storage\ncraft_item(Prototype.IronChest)  # Changed from WoodenChest to IronChest\n\n# Place chest next to drill's output\nmove_to(drill.drop_position)\nchest = place_entity(Prototype.IronChest, position=drill.drop_position)\n\n# Place new inserter between drill and chest\ninserter1 = place_entity_next_to(\n    Prototype.BurnerInserter,\n    reference_position=drill.position,\n    direction=Direction.RIGHT,\n    spacing=1\n)\nrotate_entity(inserter1, Direction.RIGHT)\ninsert_item(Prototype.Coal, inserter1, quantity=5)\n\n# Place another inserter between chest and nearest furnace\nfurnaces = get_entities({Prototype.StoneFurnace})\ntarget_furnace = furnaces[0]\n\ninserter2 = place_entity_next_to(\n    Prototype.BurnerInserter,\n    reference_position=chest.position,\n    direction=Direction.RIGHT,\n    spacing=1\n)\nrotate_entity(inserter2, Direction.RIGHT)\ninsert_item(Prototype.Coal, inserter2, quantity=5)\n\n# Add fuel to furnaces\nfor furnace in furnaces:\n    insert_item(Prototype.Coal, furnace, quantity=10)\n\n# Verify our corrected setup\nprint(\"Corrected automation setup:\")\nprint(f\"Inventory: {inspect_inventory()}\")\nprint(f\"Entities: {get_entities()}\")\n```\n\nLet's break down what we're trying to achieve:\n1. Clear existing inserters to start fresh\n2. Create a storage solution (iron chest) for the mined ore\n3. Set up an inserter to move ore from drill to chest\n4. Set up another inserter to move ore from chest to furnace\n5. Ensure everything has fuel\n\nThis should create a proper automation chain:\nDrill -> Inserter -> Chest -> Inserter -> Furnace\n\nEach component should be properly fueled and oriented to create a working automation line for iron ore processing.", "summary_range": "[1-22]"}
