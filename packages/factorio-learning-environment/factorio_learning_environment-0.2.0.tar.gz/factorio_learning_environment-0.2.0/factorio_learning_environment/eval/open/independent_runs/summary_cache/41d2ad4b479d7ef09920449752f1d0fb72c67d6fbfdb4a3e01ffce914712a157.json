Always use an inserter as an intermediary between belts and machines/chests.\n- When connecting entities with belts, make sure the path is clear and no other entities are blocking the way.\n- When using `connect_entities()` with a chest as source, you need to add an inserter that takes items from the chest and use the inserter as the source entity.\n\n### Errors when placing entities near existing structures\n- Check for existing entities (like pipes, electric poles) before placing new entities in the same position.\n- When placing inserters next to machines, adjust the spacing or direction if the initial placement fails.\n- Use appropriate spacing parameters when placing entities next to others to avoi"}
