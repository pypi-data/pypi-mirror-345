{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Setup at (-15.0, -50.0)\n- Burner mining drill positioned at (-15.0, -50.0)\n- Currently has coal fuel and is mining iron ore\n- Output is blocked due to missing output collection structure\n\n### Smelting Setup at (0.0, 0.0)\n- Two stone furnaces positioned at:\n  - Furnace 1 at (0.0, 0.0)\n  - Furnace 2 at (2.0, 0.0)\n- Both furnaces have coal fuel but no ingredients to smelt\n- Burner inserter at (-1.5, 0.5) facing right, meant to feed first furnace\n- Inserter is out of fuel and waiting for source items\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Distance Related Placement Errors\n- Move closer to target location before placing entities\n- Maximum placement distance is 10 tiles from player position\n\n### Resource/Recipe Related Errors\n- Ensure required raw resources are gathered before attempting to craft items that need them\n- Example: Wood needs to be gathered first before wooden chests can be crafted\n\n### Entity Placement Errors\n- Check if target location is clear and buildable before placing entities\n- Verify there is enough space for the full dimensions of the entity being placed\n- Ensure you have the required entity in inventory before attempting placement\n\n### Mining Setup Issues\n- Place output collection entities (like chests) to prevent mining drills from getting blocked\n- Ensure proper fuel supply for burner entities to keep them operational\n\n### Belt Connection Issues\n- Cannot connect transport belts directly to furnaces\n- Use inserters as intermediaries between belts and furnaces\n\n### Entity Spacing Issues\n- When placing entities next to existing ones, ensure proper spacing\n- Consider direction and reference position when using place_entity_next_to"}
