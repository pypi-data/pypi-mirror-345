{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=1.5, y=27.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=1.5, y=27.5) with status: EntityStatus.NOT_CONNECTED\n- Boiler at position (x=-2.5, y=25.0) with steam output at position (x=-2.5, y=23.5)\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-7.5, y=25.5) with fluid box containing water\n- PipeGroup (fluid system=17195) connecting the offshore pump to the boiler, with pipes at positions [(x=-6.5, y=24.5), (x=-7.5, y=24.5), (x=-4.5, y=25.5), (x=-4.5, y=24.5), (x=-5.5, y=24.5)]\n- PipeGroup (fluid system=17198) intended to connect the boiler to the steam engine, with pipes at positions [(x=-0.5, y=27.5), (x=-0.5, y=28.5), (x=-0.5, y=29.5)]\n- PipeGroup (fluid system=17197) with pipes at positions [(x=0.5, y=30.5), (x=1.5, y=30.5)]\n- ElectricityGroup (id=90419) with poles at various positions, including (x=0.5, y=24.5)\n\n### Furnace Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with status: EntityStatus.NO_INGREDIENTS and containing iron-plate\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Boiler to Steam Engine\n- Ensure that pipes are placed correctly to connect the boiler's steam output to the steam engine's input. Verify that there are no obstructions preventing pipe placement.\n\n### Errors when Placing Pipes\n- Before attempting to place a pipe, confirm that the target position is not occupied by another entity to avoid placement errors.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Fuel\n- Maintain a sufficient supply of coal in your inventory to refuel boilers and other fuel-dependent entities to prevent operational interruptions.\n\n### Errors Due to Steam Engine Not Being Connected\n- Check that all necessary connections are established between the steam engine and the boiler to ensure the steam engine receives the required steam input."}
