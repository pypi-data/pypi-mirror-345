{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (17.5, 20.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Steam Engine** at position (17.5, 20.5) with status NOT_CONNECTED, indicating no input liquid and no fluid present in connections.\n- **Boiler** at position (1.5, 23.0) with status NO_FUEL, indicating it is out of fuel. It is connected to a series of pipes and has a steam output point at (1.5, 21.5).\n- **Offshore Pump** at position (-9.5, 24.5) with status WORKING, supplying water to the system. It is connected to pipes that transport water.\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- **Pipe Group** for fluid system 5195, starting at position (3.5, 17.5) with status EMPTY, consisting of multiple pipes connecting various positions.\n- **Pipe Group** for fluid system 5206, starting at position (-9.5, 23.5) with status FULL_OUTPUT, transporting water from the offshore pump through a series of connected pipes.\n\n### Electricity Network\n- **Electricity Group** with ID 9725, consisting of power poles at various positions, but currently with a voltage of 0, indicating no power is being transmitted.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Steam Engine Connectivity\n- Ensure that the steam engine is properly connected to a source of steam or water. Check the connections to ensure that there is fluid present in the connections.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Fuel in Boiler\n- Regularly check and refuel the boiler to ensure it has sufficient fuel to operate. This will prevent the boiler from being in a NO_FUEL status.\n\n### Errors in Electricity Network\n- Verify that the electricity network is properly connected and that there is a power source to provide voltage. Ensure that all poles are connected and that there is a functioning generator.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions**: None defined.\n- **Variables**: None explicitly assigned in the logs provided."}
