{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=1.5, y=23.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting various positions, including (x=3.5, y=17.5) and (x=-9.5, y=23.5)\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at multiple positions, including (x=26.5, y=17.5) and (x=10.5, y=17.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Boiler Fueling\n- Ensure that the boiler has sufficient fuel to operate. Regularly check the fuel inventory and replenish it as needed to avoid the \"out of fuel\" status.\n\n### Errors with Steam Engine Connection\n- Make sure that the steam engine is properly connected to a source of fluid. Check all connection points and ensure that the necessary pipes are in place to deliver fluid to the engine.\n\n### Errors with Offshore Pump Connection\n- Verify that the offshore pump is correctly connected to the fluid system. Ensure that all pipes are properly aligned and connected to facilitate the flow of water.\n\n### General Tips for Entity Placement\n- Before placing an entity, ensure that the target tile is unoccupied and suitable for the entity type. This will prevent placement errors and ensure efficient use of space."}
