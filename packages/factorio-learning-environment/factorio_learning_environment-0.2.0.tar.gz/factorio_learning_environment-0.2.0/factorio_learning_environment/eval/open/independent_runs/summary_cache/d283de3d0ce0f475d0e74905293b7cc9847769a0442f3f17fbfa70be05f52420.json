{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-47.5, -123.5)\n- Boiler at position (-46.5, -119.0)\n- Steam Engine at position (-40.5, -113.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine with various segments such as (x=-44.5, y=-122.5), (x=-46.5, y=-120.5), and others.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -76.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-15.5, -77.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -73.0) with a fuel inventory of coal and processing iron ore into copper plates\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (9.0, -64.0) and (6.0, -62.0) with coal as fuel, producing iron plates\n- Wooden Chest at position (7.5, -61.5) storing iron plates\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) transferring items between entities\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of:\n- Small Electric Poles at various positions such as (x=-29.5, y=-106.5), (x=-36.5, y=-93.5), and others, connecting various entities to the electricity network\n\n### Research Lab\nConsists of:\n- Lab with input of automation science packs, currently not powered\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Pipe Connection\n- Ensure that pipes are correctly aligned and connected between the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine. Check for any missing or misaligned pipe segments that prevent fluid flow.\n\n### Boiler Not Operational\n- Verify that the boiler is connected properly to both the offshore pump and the steam engine. Ensure that there is a continuous path for the fluid and that all necessary connections are established.\n\n### Inserter Not Receiving Power\n- Check the connection of the inserter to the electricity network. Ensure that the inserter is within the range of powered electric poles and that the poles are connected to a power source.\n\n### Mining Drill Out of Fuel\n- Regularly check and refuel the burner mining drill to maintain continuous operation. Ensure that there is a steady supply of fuel available.\n\n### Furnace with No Ingredients\n- Ensure that the stone furnaces have the necessary raw materials to process. Check the input inventory of the furnaces and supply the required ingredients for smelting.\n\nBy addressing these errors and ensuring proper connections and supplies, the efficiency and functionality of the structures can be significantly improved."}
