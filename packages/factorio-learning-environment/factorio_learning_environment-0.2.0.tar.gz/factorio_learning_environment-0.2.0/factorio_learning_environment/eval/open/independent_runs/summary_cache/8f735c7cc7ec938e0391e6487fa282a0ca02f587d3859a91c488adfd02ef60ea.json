{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (9.0, -64.0) with fuel and copper ore, producing iron plates.\n- Stone Furnace at position (6.0, -62.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Storage and Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (7.5, -61.5).\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) not receiving electricity, connected to a small electric pole and a wooden chest.\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (-1.5, 24.5).\n- Boiler at position (-5.5, 24.0) with no input liquid.\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5) working, connected to pipes.\n\n### Pipe Network\n- PipeGroup with fluid system 1145, carrying water, consisting of pipes at positions (-8.5, 23.5), (-9.5, 23.5), and (-7.5, 23.5).\n- PipeGroup with fluid system 1148, empty, consisting of pipes at positions (1.5, 23.5), (1.5, 22.5), and (1.5, 24.5).\n\n### Electricity Network\n- ElectricityGroup with id 35573, consisting of poles at various positions, currently not connected to the power network.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing pipes\n- Ensure that the target location for placing pipes does not overlap with water or other existing entities. Consider adjusting the path or location to avoid conflicts.\n\n### Errors when crafting and placing entities\n- Verify that all required materials are available before attempting to craft items like small electric poles.\n- Ensure there is a suitable and unoccupied position for placing entities like small electric poles to avoid placement errors.\n\n### Undefined Function Error\n- Ensure that all functions used in the code, such as `smelt_ore_to_plate_and_craft_cable()`, are properly defined and accessible within the script.\n\n### Power Connectivity Issues\n- Check that all entities requiring power, such as inserters and labs, are properly connected to the electricity network to avoid power shortages."}
