{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (17.5, 20.5)\nConsists of:\n- **Steam Engine** at position (17.5, 20.5) with energy 15000.0, connected to:\n  - **Pipe-to-Ground** at position (16.5, 17.5)\n  - **Pipe** at position (17.5, 17.5)\n- **Boiler** at position (1.5, 23.0) with fuel inventory containing 38 coal, connected to:\n  - **Pipe** at positions (-0.5, 21.5), (1.5, 21.5), (0.5, 21.5), (2.5, 21.5), (3.5, 21.5), (-0.5, 23.5)\n- **Offshore Pump** at position (-9.5, 24.5) connected to:\n  - **Pipe** at positions (-9.5, 23.5), (-8.5, 23.5)\n- **PipeGroup** for steam, starting at position (3.5, 17.5) and ending at (10.5, 21.5)\n- **PipeGroup** for water, starting at position (-9.5, 23.5) and ending at (-0.5, 23.5)\n\n### Electricity Network\n- **ElectricityGroup** with poles at positions (27.5, 26.5), (1.5, 6.5), (7.5, 8.5), (14.5, 20.5), (35.5, 20.5), (10.5, 13.5), maintaining voltage 0.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors when Connecting Entities\n- Ensure that the entities you are trying to connect are within a valid range and that the connection points are correctly aligned. In the case of connecting a pipe to a steam engine, verify that the pipe's output position matches the steam engine's input position.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - `connect_entities(steam_output_position, steam_engine_position, Prototype.Pipe)`: Failed due to misalignment of connection points between the pipe and steam engine.\n  \n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `steam_output_position`: Position of the steam output from the boiler.\n  - `steam_engine_position`: Position of the steam engine intended for connection.\n  - `Prototype.Pipe`: Type of entity used for connection attempts."}
