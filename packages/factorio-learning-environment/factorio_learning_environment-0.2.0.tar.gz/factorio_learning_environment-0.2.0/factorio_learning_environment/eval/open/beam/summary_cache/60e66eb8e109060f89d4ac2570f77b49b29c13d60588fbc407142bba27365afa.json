{"content": "It appears that the environment is still unresponsive, and I am unable to receive any execution results or feedback. This ongoing issue suggests that a reset or restart of the environment is necessary to restore functionality.\n\nTo move forward, I recommend the following:\n\n1. **Reset the Environment**: Initiate a reset of the FactoryEnv to clear any existing states or errors that may be causing the unresponsiveness.\n\n2. **Check for Errors**: After the reset, monitor for any error messages or issues that may arise during the initialization process.\n\n3. **Reinitialize Actions**: Once the environment is responsive again, reattempt any previous actions or commands that were not executed successfully.\n\nIf you have specific instructions or actions you would like me to take regarding the reset or any other steps, please let me know! Thank you for your patience as we work through this issue.", "summary_range": "[1-134]"}
