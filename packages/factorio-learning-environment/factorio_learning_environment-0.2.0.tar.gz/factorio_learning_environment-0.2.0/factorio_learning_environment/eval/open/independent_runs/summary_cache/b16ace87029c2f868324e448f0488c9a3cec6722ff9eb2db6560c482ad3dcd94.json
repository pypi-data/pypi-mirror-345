{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at Position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0)\n  - Fuel: 4 units of coal\n  - Direction: UP\n  - Status: WORKING\n  - Resources: 40,000 units of iron ore\n  - Warnings: Output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n- **Stone Furnace** at Position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)\n  - Fuel: 14 units of coal\n  - Direction: UP\n  - Status: NO_INGREDIENTS\n  - Furnace Result: 60 iron plates\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied or invalid locations\n- Ensure the desired location is free of other entities or obstacles before attempting to place a new entity. This includes checking for existing entities like chests, inserters, and transport belts.\n\n### Errors when moving entities to invalid locations\n- Verify that the target location is valid and free of other entities before attempting to move an entity like a Stone Furnace.\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities from specific positions\n- Confirm the existence of the entity at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it. This can be done by checking the map or using a function that verifies the entity's presence.\n\n### Errors due to lack of resources in inventory\n- Ensure that the required resources, such as coal, are available in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities like drills.\n\n### Warnings related to blocked outputs\n- Address warnings by ensuring that there is a sink entity, such as a chest or belt, to accept the output from entities like the Burner Mining Drill. This will prevent output blockage and allow continuous operation."}
