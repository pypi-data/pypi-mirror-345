{"content": "## Report\n\n### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (7 units)\n  - Energy: 2666.67\n  - Status: Working\n  - Warnings: Output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Drop Position: (x=-16.5, y=-52.5)\n  - Neighbours: Stone Furnace at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)\n  - Resources: Iron Ore (40,000 units)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (14 units)\n  - Energy: 1600.0\n  - Status: No Ingredients\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Furnace Result: Iron Plate (60 units)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when placing entities at occupied or invalid locations\n- Ensure that the target tile is unoccupied and suitable for the entity before attempting to place it. This applies to:\n  - Wooden Chests\n  - Burner Inserters\n  - Transport Belts\n  - Stone Furnaces\n\n#### Errors when connecting belts directly to incompatible objects\n- Avoid connecting belts directly to Stone Furnaces. Use an inserter to input items into the furnace.\n\n#### Errors when extracting or interacting with entities from a distance\n- Move closer to the target entity before attempting to extract items or interact with it to ensure successful operations.\n\n#### Errors when attempting to connect belts\n- Ensure that the path for the belt is clear and that all positions are valid for belt placement."}
