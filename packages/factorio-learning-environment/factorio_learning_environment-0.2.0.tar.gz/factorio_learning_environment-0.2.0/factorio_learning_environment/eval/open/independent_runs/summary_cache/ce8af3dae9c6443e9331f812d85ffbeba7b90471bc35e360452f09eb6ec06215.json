The area remains heavily obstructed by multiple burner-inserters, a burner-mining-drill, and associated transport-belt groups. Manual clearance in the candidate zone is now required before attempting placement.\n\u2022 Risky Automated Clearance Operations  \n\u2003\u2013 Prior automated clearance procedures have inadvertently removed critical structure components. Verify the importance of adjacent entities before initiating clearance.\n\u2022 Inconsistent Candidate Zone Selection  \n\u2003\u2013 Multiple candidate positions have been repeatedly identified as obstructed. Improve obstruction detection and candidate selection to better distinguish between non\u2010critical clutter and key structural components.\n\nNAMESPACE\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nget_connection_amount(boiler: Entity, extra_se: Entity, connection_type: Prototype) -> int  \n\u2003\u2013 Determines the required number of pipes to connect two entities; raises an exception if connectivity or spatial conditions are not met.\n\nplace_entity(entity_type: Prototype, position: Position, direction: Direction) -> Entity  \n\u2003\u2013 Attempts to place an entity of the specified type at a given position and orientation; fails if the tile is occupied or if the necessary item is absent from inventory.\n\ncraft_item(item: Prototype, quantity: int) -> int  \n\u2003\u2013 Initiates crafting for a specified item and quantity; throws an exception if essential sub-ingredients or an operational production facility is missing.\n\nImportant Variables:\n\u2022 inventory: dict[str, int] \u2014 Represents the current inventory.\n\u2022 boiler: Entity \u2014 Refers to the boiler at (8.0, 20.5).\n\u2022 extra_se: Entity \u2014 Denotes the extra steam engine at (11.5, 18.5).\n\u2022 new_buildable_area: BuildableArea \u2014 Utility used to determine available buildable regions."}
