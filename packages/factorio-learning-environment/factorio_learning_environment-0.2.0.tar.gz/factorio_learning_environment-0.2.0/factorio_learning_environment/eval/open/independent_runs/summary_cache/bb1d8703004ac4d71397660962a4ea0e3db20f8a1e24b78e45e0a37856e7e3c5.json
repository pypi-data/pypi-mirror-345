{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Smelting Setup at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone furnace** at position (-15.0, -50.0)\n- **Burner inserter** at position (-13.5, -49.5) facing the furnace\n- **Wooden chest** at position (-12.5, -49.5) to collect iron plates\n\nThis setup is designed to smelt iron ore into iron plates using coal as fuel. The burner inserter transfers the smelted iron plates from the furnace to the wooden chest.\n\n---\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### 1. **Smelting Timeout Errors**\n- **Issue**: The agent repeatedly encountered smelting timeout errors, indicating the furnace was not producing iron plates despite having fuel and iron ore.\n- **Solution**: Ensure the furnace has sufficient fuel and iron ore. Verify the burner inserter is correctly positioned and fueled to transfer items from the furnace to the chest.\n\n#### 2. **Extraction Errors**\n- **Issue**: The agent attempted to extract iron plates from the furnace before they were produced, resulting in extraction errors.\n- **Solution**: Check the furnace's output before attempting to extract items. Ensure the smelting process is complete and the furnace contains the desired items.\n\n#### 3. **Entity Placement Errors**\n- **Issue**: The agent tried to place a burner inserter next to the furnace but encountered a collision with a wooden chest.\n- **Solution**: Plan entity placements carefully to avoid collisions. Use appropriate spacing or adjust the direction of placement to ensure entities do not overlap.\n\n#### 4. **Inventory Management Errors**\n- **Issue**: The agent attempted to insert coal into the inserter but had insufficient coal in its inventory.\n- **Solution**: Monitor inventory levels before performing actions that require specific items. Ensure you have the necessary resources in your inventory before attempting to use them.\n\n#### 5. **Crafting Errors**\n- **Issue**: The agent failed to craft a burner mining drill due to missing iron plates, which require smelting in a furnace.\n- **Solution**: Prioritize smelting iron ore into iron plates before attempting to craft advanced items like burner mining drills. Ensure all required sub-ingredients are available.\n\n#### 6. **Entity Placement Without Inventory**\n- **Issue**: The agent attempted to place a burner mining drill without having one in its inventory.\n- **Solution**: Always check your inventory for the required entity before attempting to place it. Craft or obtain the necessary items beforehand."}
