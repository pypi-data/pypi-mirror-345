{"content": "# Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (42.0, -83.0) with warnings of 'out of fuel' and 'output blocked by item on the ground'. The drill is connected to a transport belt.\n- Burner Inserter at position (42.5, -81.5) with a fuel inventory of coal. It is waiting for source items and is connected to both the mining drill and transport belt.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -49.0) with a fuel inventory of coal, currently working with iron ore as the source and producing iron plates.\n- BeltGroup connecting the transport belt from position (43.5, -82.5) to (43.5, -79.5) facilitating the movement of items between entities.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Ensure the target tile is free of other entities before attempting to place a new entity. This will prevent placement errors such as those encountered when trying to place a Wooden Chest.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient inventory items\n- Always check your inventory for required items before attempting to connect entities with transport belts or other components. Craft or acquire more items if necessary to avoid connection failures.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors with blocked outputs\n- Ensure there is a sink entity in place to accept the output from drills or other production entities to avoid output blockage warnings."}
