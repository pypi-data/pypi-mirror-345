Verify that the targeted PipeGroup both exists and is active before initiating a connection to supply water.\n\n\u2022 Fixed Pipeline Stabilization Delays:\n  - Using fixed 10-second wait intervals after each connection attempt leads to unnecessary idle time. Replace static delays with dynamic checks that monitor the pipeline network\u2019s stabilization status."}
