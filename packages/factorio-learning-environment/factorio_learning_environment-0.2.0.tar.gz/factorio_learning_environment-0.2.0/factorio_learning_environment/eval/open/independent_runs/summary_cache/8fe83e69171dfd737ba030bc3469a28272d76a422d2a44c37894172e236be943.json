{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) extracting coal\n- Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5) for coal storage\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-20.0, -70.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -70.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates\n- Wooden Chest at position (-20.5, -63.5) storing iron plates\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Transport System at Position (-23.0, -68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) extracting copper ore\n- Wooden Chest at position (-23.5, -69.5) storing copper ore\n- Transport Belt network connecting the mining drill to the storage chest\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Transport System at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) extracting iron ore\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -54.5) storing iron ore\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5) transferring iron ore to another chest\n- Transport Belt network connecting the mining drill to the storage chest\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates\n- Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5) storing iron plates\n- Burner Inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) transferring items between chests\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Full Storage\n- Ensure that chests used for storage have enough space to accommodate incoming items. Regularly check and empty full chests to prevent production halts.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Verify that the source entities for inserters have items available for transfer. Adjust production or supply lines to ensure continuous item flow.\n\n### Errors with Furnaces Lacking Ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces have a continuous supply of ingredients to process. Check the supply chain to identify and resolve any disruptions.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Output Full\n- Regularly remove processed items from furnaces to prevent them from halting due to full output slots. Consider using inserters to automate the removal process."}
