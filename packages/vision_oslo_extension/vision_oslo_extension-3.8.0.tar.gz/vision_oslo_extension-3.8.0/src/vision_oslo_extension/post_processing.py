"""
Pre-requisite: 
SimulationName.oof: default oslo output file after successfully run a simulation.
xxxxx.txt: User configuration file under some options.
Used Input:
simname: to locate the result file or file rename
main_option: to decide which subfunction to go
time_start: to define the analysis start time
time_end: to define the analysis end time
option_select: to define the option selected in subfunction
text_input:
low_v:
time_step:
Expected Output:
Various new .csv file depending on the option selection.
Description:
This script defines 3 options which is easy to achieve.
In list_train_data(), it generates ****.osop.lst file using default list file extraction command. Then it reads the file line by line depending on the header. Rearrange the information in list manipulation and output as a csv file. Very straightforward.
In low_voltage_analysis(), it calls the list_train-data() first. Then it analysis the result list one by one comparing the voltage against the threshold and save the new information in a new list. Then it collates all information which meets the criteria and rearrange in a new list. Very straightforward method.
In umean_useful(), it generates ****.osop.lst file using default list file extraction command. Then it read the file line by line and filter out the train information within the selected branches. Then it processes the big list, split the train and calculate the average value. The process is straightforward in general and the detailed mean useful calculation is defined in umean_useful_process(). It should be noted that the calculation is still under debate which value should be used for the output. There for the calculation output principle might needs to be changed. Some other output option is commented out but kept in to code in case the designer want to change at some point.
Attention:
Option 1 and 2 need to be further updated in the future as their usage is not that meaningful.
