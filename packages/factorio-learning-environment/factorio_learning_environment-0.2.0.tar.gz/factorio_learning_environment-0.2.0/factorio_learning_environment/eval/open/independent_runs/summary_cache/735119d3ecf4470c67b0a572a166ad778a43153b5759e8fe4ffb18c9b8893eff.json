{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Coal Mining Operation at Position (x=41.0, y=-86.0)\n- **Burner Mining Drills**: \n  - Position (x=41.0, y=-86.0) and (x=43.0, y=-86.0)\n  - Both drills are out of fuel and have warnings about full chests at drop positions.\n- **Wooden Chests**: \n  - Position (x=43.5, y=-84.5) with 358 coal.\n  - Position (x=41.5, y=-82.5) with 727 coal.\n- **Burner Inserters**: \n  - Position (x=41.5, y=-83.5) and (x=43.5, y=-80.5), both waiting for source items.\n- **Transport Belt**: \n  - Connects the mining drills to the chests.\n\n#### Iron Smelting Setup at Position (x=-15.0, y=-51.0)\n- **Burner Mining Drill**: \n  - Position (x=-17.0, y=-52.0), out of fuel and with a full chest warning.\n- **Stone Furnaces**: \n  - Position (x=-15.0, y=-51.0) and (x=-13.0, y=-50.0), both with no ingredients to smelt.\n- **Burner Inserters**: \n  - Position (x=-14.5, y=-52.5) and (x=-17.5, y=-50.5), both waiting for source items.\n- **Wooden Chests**: \n  - Position (x=-16.5, y=-50.5) with 58 iron ore.\n  - Position (x=-13.5, y=-51.5), empty.\n\n#### Coal Smelting Setup at Position (x=43.0, y=-79.0)\n- **Stone Furnace**: \n  - Position (x=43.0, y=-79.0), no ingredients to smelt.\n- **Burner Inserters**: \n  - Position (x=43.5, y=-77.5) and (x=44.5, y=-78.5), both waiting for source items.\n- **Wooden Chests**: \n  - Position (x=43.5, y=-76.5), empty.\n\n---\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when placing entities next to occupied tiles\n- **Issue**: Repeated attempts to place a burner inserter next to a furnace at position (x=-15.0, y=-51.0) failed due to collisions with existing entities or invalid placement areas (e.g., water).\n- **Solution**: \n  - Increase spacing when placing entities next to existing structures.\n  - Verify the placement area is free of obstructions or water before attempting to place an entity.\n  - Use different directions or reference positions to avoid collisions.\n\n#### Errors with mining drills and full chests\n- **Issue**: Mining drills at positions (x=43.0, y=-86.0) and (x=-17.0, y=-52.0) are unable to operate due to full chests at their drop positions.\n- **Solution**: \n  - Regularly empty chests at drop positions to allow mining drills to continue operation.\n  - Ensure chests are connected to transport belts or inserters to move items away from the mining area.\n\n#### Errors with furnaces lacking ingredients\n- **Issue**: Furnaces at positions (x=-15.0, y=-51.0), (x=-13.0, y=-50.0), and (x=43.0, y=-79.0) are not smelting due to a lack of ingredients.\n- **Solution**: \n  - Ensure inserters are correctly configured to supply furnaces with raw materials.\n  - Verify that mining drills and transport belts are operational and delivering resources to the furnaces.\n\n#### Errors with inserters waiting for source items\n- **Issue**: Multiple burner inserters are waiting for source items, indicating a lack of materials in their pickup positions.\n- **Solution**: \n  - Ensure that the source entities (e.g., mining drills, chests) are operational and have items available for pickup.\n  - Check transport belts and inserter configurations to ensure smooth item flow."}
