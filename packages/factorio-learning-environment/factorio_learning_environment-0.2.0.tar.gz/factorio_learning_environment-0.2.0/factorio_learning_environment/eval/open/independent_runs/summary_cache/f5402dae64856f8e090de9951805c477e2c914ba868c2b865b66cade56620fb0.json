{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nCurrently, there are no structures built on the map. The logs indicate attempts to place various entities such as Burner Mining Drills and Stone Furnaces, but these attempts have been unsuccessful. Therefore, no structures have been established.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied or invalid locations\n- Ensure that the target location is unoccupied and suitable for the entity you are trying to place. This includes checking for available space and ensuring the location is not already occupied by another entity.\n\n### Errors related to finding buildable spots\n- When attempting to place entities like the Burner Mining Drill, ensure that the BuildingBox size is appropriate for the available space. If no viable location is found, consider reducing the BuildingBox size or using multiple smaller BuildingBoxes to fit the available area.\n\n### Errors in setup not producing expected outputs\n- Verify the configuration of your setup to ensure that all components are correctly placed and connected. For example, if iron plates are not being produced, check the alignment and connection of mining drills, furnaces, and inserters.\n\n### Errors in retrieving entities from the map\n- When attempting to interact with entities on the map, ensure that the specified position actually contains the intended entity. If an entity is not found at a given position, double-check the coordinates and ensure the entity exists at that location.\n\n### General tips for avoiding errors\n- Regularly update and verify the map's entity data to ensure that your actions are based on the most current information.\n- Before placing an entity, ensure that your inventory contains the necessary items and that the placement logic is correctly implemented to avoid errors related to missing entities or incorrect placements."}
