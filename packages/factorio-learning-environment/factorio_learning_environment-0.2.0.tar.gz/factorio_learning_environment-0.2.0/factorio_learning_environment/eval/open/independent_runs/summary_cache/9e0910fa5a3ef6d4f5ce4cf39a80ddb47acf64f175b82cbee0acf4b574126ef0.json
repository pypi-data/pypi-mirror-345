{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report (Updated)\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at position (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump (position: -9.5, -0.5) - working (water: 88.6, temp: 15\u00b0C)\n- Boiler (position: -6.0, 1.5) - connected with pipes (48 coal remaining)\n- Steam engine (position: -1.5, 4.5) - connected to boiler via pipes\n- Pipe network (3 pipes from pump to boiler, 4 pipes from boiler to engine)\n\n### Secondary Electricity Generator at position (-9.5, 1.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump (position: -9.5, 1.5) - working (water: 99.99, temp: 15\u00b0C)\n- Boiler (position: -6.0, 1.5) - connected with 48 coal\n- Steam engine (position: -1.5, 4.5) - producing power\n\n### Iron Production Line at position (15.5, 70.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill (position: 17.5, 0.5) - output blocked, no power\n- Stone furnace (position: 16.0, 74.0) - working with 48 coal, contains 53 iron plates\n- Assembling machine 2 (position: 18.5, 74.5) - no power, missing iron plates for gear production\n- Small electric poles providing partial power coverage\n\n### Remote Production Site at position (100.0, 100.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace (position: 100.0, 100.0) - working with 18 coal, contains 17 iron plates\n- Assembling machine 2 (position: 102.5, 100.5) - no power connection\n\n### Electricity Groups\nMultiple disconnected electricity groups detected at:\n- (31.5,51.5) with multiple poles (now producing power)\n- (50.5,54.5) with 1 pole\n- (100.5,104.5) with 1 pole\n- (150.5,154.5) with 2 poles\n- (200.5,204.5) with 1 pole\n- (300.5,300.5) with 2 poles\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Placement Errors (28 total instances)\n- Water placement: Verify terrain is land before placing (occurred at (200.5,200.5), (300.0,300.0), (400.0,400.0))\n- Occupied tiles: Check tile is empty before placing (persistent issue at (17.0,74.0))\n- Distance limitations: Move within placement range before attempting (occurred at (-9.5,5.0))\n- Inventory checks: Verify item exists in inventory before placement (offshore pump missing)\n\n### Power System Issues\n- Fluid connections: Ensure proper pipe alignment between boilers and engines\n- Electrical networks: Remote sites still lack power connections\n- Production halted: Assemblers still missing required resources\n\n### Entity Access Errors\n- Missing entities: Verify entity exists before accessing (boiler at (-6.0,1.5) not found)\n- Invalid object types: Ensure correct prototypes are used\n\n### Production Chain Issues\n- Iron ore backlog: Drill at (17.5,0.5) output blocked\n- Assembler starvation: No progress on gear production due to missing plates\n- Resource imbalance: 53 iron plates accumulated in furnace\n\n### Fluid System Errors\n- Pipe connections: Steam not reaching all intended destinations (connection failures at (-4.5,1.5))\n- Blocked paths: Clear obstructions between fluid connection points\n\n### Code Execution Errors\n- Connection validation: Some fluid connections now established but others failing\n- Assertion failures: Area clearing assertions still failing\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `find_empty_position()` -> Position: Still failing due to uncleared areas\n- `clear_area(position: Position, radius: float)` -> bool: Assertion failures persist\n\n### Important Variables\n- `entities_remaining: List[Entity]` - Tracking uncleared entities\n- `empty_pos: Position` - Stores found empty positions (when successful)"}
