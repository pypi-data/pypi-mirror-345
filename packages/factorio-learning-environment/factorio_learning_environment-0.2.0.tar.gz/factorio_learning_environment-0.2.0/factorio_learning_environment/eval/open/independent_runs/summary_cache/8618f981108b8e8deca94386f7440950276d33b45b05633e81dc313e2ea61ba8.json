In Step 5, the agent tried to craft stone furnaces without having enough stone.\n- Ensure that the required sub-ingredients can be crafted. In Step 12, the agent failed to craft assembling-machine-1 because it couldn't craft iron-plate.\n\n### Placement Errors\n- Check if the target position is occupied before placing an entity. In Step 6, the agent tried to place a stone furnace at a position that was already occupied.\n\n### Insertion Errors\n- Verify that the item to be inserted is available in the inventory. In Step 7, the agent tried to insert iron ore into a furnace without having iron ore in the inventory.\n\n### Extraction Errors\n- Ensure that the entity contains the item to be extracted.
