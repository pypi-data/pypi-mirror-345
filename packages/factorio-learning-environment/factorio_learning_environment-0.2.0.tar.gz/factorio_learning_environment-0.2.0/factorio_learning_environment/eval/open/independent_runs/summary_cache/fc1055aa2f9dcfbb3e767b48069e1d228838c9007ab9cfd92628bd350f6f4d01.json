{"content": "# FACTORIO REPORT\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System (around x=-6.0, y=1.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, -0.5)\n- Boiler at position (-6.0, 1.5)\n- Steam engine at position (-1.5, 4.5)\n- Small electric poles at positions (-1.5, 10.5), (-1.5, 7.5)\n- Pipe network connecting these components\n\nThe system is operational and producing approximately 25 steam per 60 seconds, with the steam engine working and connected to the power network. The boiler has been refueled with coal multiple times to maintain operation.\n\n### Iron Mining and Smelting Setup (around x=20.5, y=75.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Electric mining drills at positions (16.5, 71.5) and (21.5, 71.5)\n- Stone furnaces at positions (17.0, 75.0) and (22.0, 75.0)\n- Burner inserters at positions (16.5, 73.5) and (21.5, 73.5) connecting drills to furnaces\n- Output inserters at positions (17.5, 76.5), (17.5, 77.5), and (22.5, 77.5)\n- Wooden chest at position (20.5, 78.5) for collecting iron plates\n- Inserter at position (20.5, 76.5) to extract iron plates from chest\n- Transport belt system connecting the iron chest to the circuit assembler\n\nThe mining drills are operational but waiting for space in destination as the output is currently blocked. The furnaces are actively smelting iron ore into plates, with the first furnace containing 15 iron plates and the second furnace containing 38 iron plates. The wooden chest currently contains 3 iron plates.\n\n### Copper Mining and Smelting Setup (around x=-51.5, y=85.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Electric mining drills at positions (-55.5, 81.5) and (-50.5, 81.5)\n- Stone furnaces at positions (-55.0, 85.0) and (-50.0, 85.0)\n- Burner inserters at positions (-55.5, 83.5) and (-50.5, 83.5) connecting drills to furnaces\n- Output inserters at positions (-54.5, 87.5) and (-49.5, 87.5)\n- Wooden chest at position (-52.5, 89.5) for collecting copper plates\n- Inserter at position (-52.5, 87.5) to extract copper plates from chest\n- Transport belt system connecting the copper chest to the copper cable assembler\n\nThe mining drills are operational but waiting for space in destination. The furnaces are actively smelting copper ore into plates, with the first furnace containing 12 copper plates and the second furnace containing 12 copper plates. The wooden chest is currently empty as copper plates are being consumed by the cable assembler.\n\n### Copper Cable Assembly (around x=-23.5, y=66.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine at position (-23.5, 66.5) with copper cable recipe\n- Input inserter at position (-25.5, 66.5)\n- Output inserter at position (-21.5, 66.5)\n- Small electric poles connecting to power network\n- Transport belt system bringing copper plates from the copper chest\n- Wooden chest at position (-26.5, 66.5) to collect copper cables\n- Transport belt system carrying copper cables to the electronic circuit assembler\n\nThe assembler is experiencing ingredient shortages for copper plates. The wooden chest at position (-26.5, 66.5) contains 6 copper cables. The transport belt system connecting to the electronic circuit assembler contains copper cables (2 on one belt group and 10 on another).\n\n### Electronic Circuit Assembly (around x=-5.5, y=69.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine at position (-5.5, 69.5) with electronic circuit recipe\n- Input inserter at position (-5.5, 67.5)\n- Input inserter at position (-7.5, 69.5"}
