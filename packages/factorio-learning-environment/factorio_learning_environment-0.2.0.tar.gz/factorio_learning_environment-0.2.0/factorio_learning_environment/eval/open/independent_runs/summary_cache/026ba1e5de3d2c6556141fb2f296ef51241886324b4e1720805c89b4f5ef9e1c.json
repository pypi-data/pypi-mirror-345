{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) refueled with coal, extracting iron ore.\n- Two Stone Furnaces:\n  - Furnace at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0) producing iron plates.\n  - Furnace at position (x=-10.0, y=-48.0) producing iron plates.\n- Inserters:\n  - Burner Inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) transferring materials between entities.\n  - Burner Inserter at position (x=-8.5, y=-47.5) waiting for space in destination.\n- Chests:\n  - Wooden Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) for storage.\n  - Wooden Chest at position (x=-15.5, y=-48.5) for storage.\n  - Wooden Chest at position (x=-6.5, y=-48.5) for storing iron plates.\n  - Wooden Chest at position (x=-7.5, y=-47.5) for storage.\n  - Wooden Chest at position (x=-6.5, y=-47.5) for storing iron plates.\n  - Wooden Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-46.5) for storing iron ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Space\n- Ensure that the destination of the inserter has enough space to receive items. Consider using additional storage or managing inventory more effectively.\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities\n- Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to place an entity. For example, attempting to place a wooden chest without having one in inventory will result in an error. \n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source from which the inserter is picking up items has enough materials available. Regularly check and refill the source inventory to prevent delays in production."}
