{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=42.0, y=-83.0), which extracts resources and is connected to:\n  - **Burner Inserter** at position (x=42.5, y=-81.5), which transfers items from the mining drill to the transport belt.\n- **Transport Belt Group**:\n  - Belt from (x=42.5, y=-82.5) to (x=44.5, y=-82.5) moving right.\n  - Belt from (x=43.5, y=-81.5) to (x=43.5, y=-79.5) moving down.\n  - Belt from (x=43.5, y=-80.5) to (x=42.5, y=-79.5) moving left.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-15.0, y=-49.0), which processes raw materials into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure the intended position for placing entities like the Wooden Chest is clear of obstructions and not already occupied by another entity.\n\n### Errors when extending transport belts\n- Verify that the path for extending transport belts is clear and that there is enough space for the extension.\n\n### Errors when reconnecting transport belts\n- Ensure that the transport belts are aligned correctly and that there is a valid connection path before attempting to reconnect them.\n\n### Warnings for blocked outputs\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity in place to accept the output from the Burner Mining Drill to prevent blockage.\n\n### Warnings for full chests\n- Regularly check and clear the contents of chests to prevent inserters from being blocked due to full inventory."}
