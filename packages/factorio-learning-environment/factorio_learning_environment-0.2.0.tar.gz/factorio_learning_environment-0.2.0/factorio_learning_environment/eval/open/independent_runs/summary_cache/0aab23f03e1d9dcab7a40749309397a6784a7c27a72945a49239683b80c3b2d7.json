{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generation system at x=-25.0 y=80.5\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at x=-21.5 y=70.5 (connected to boiler)\n- Boiler at x=-25.0 y=80.5 (connected to pump and steam engine)\n- Steam engine at x=-25.5 y=89.5 (connected to boiler)\n- Pipe network connecting all components\n\n### Iron mining operation at x=15.5 y=70.5\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill at x=15.5 y=70.5 (output blocked)\n- Stone furnace at x=16.0 y=74.0\n- Burner inserter at x=15.5 y=73.5 (connecting drill and furnace)\n- Wooden chest at x=16.5 y=75.5 (output storage)\n\n### Copper mining operation at x=-46.5 y=70.5\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill at x=-46.5 y=70.5 (output blocked)\n- Stone furnace at x=-50.0 y=71.0\n- Wooden chest at x=-51.5 y=71.5 (output storage)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity placement errors\n- Verify entity exists at position before attempting to interact with it (e.g., stone furnace at x=0.0 y=74.0 didn't exist)\n- Move within 10 tiles of target position before placing entities (attempted to place burner inserter from 60 tiles away)\n- Check for obstructions when placing entities next to others (burner inserter placement blocked by furnace)\n\n### Power system issues\n- Add coal to boilers to generate steam (boiler at x=-25.0 y=80.5 has no fuel)\n- Connect steam engine to power network (steam engine at x=-25.5 y=89.5 not connected)\n- Ensure mining drills have power (both iron and copper drills show NO_POWER status)\n\n### Production chain problems\n- Connect mining drill outputs to furnaces (both drills show \"output blocked\" warnings)\n- Add fuel and ingredients to furnaces (all furnaces show NO_INGREDIENTS status)\n- Ensure inserters have fuel and proper positioning (burner inserter at x=15.5 y=73.5 waiting for source items)\n\n### Rotation errors\n- Stone furnaces cannot be rotated (attempted to rotate furnace at unknown position)"}
