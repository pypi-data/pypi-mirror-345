{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\n- Boiler at Position (x=1.5, y=23.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\n- Pipe Group connecting the Boiler and Steam Engine\n- Pipe Group connecting the Offshore Pump to the Boiler\n- Electricity Group with poles at various positions for power distribution\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Pipe Connections\n- Ensure that pipes are correctly connected between entities. The connection attempt between the boiler at (x=1.5, y=23.0) and the steam engine at (x=17.5, y=20.5) failed. Verify that the pipes are placed correctly and that there are no obstructions or missing connections.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Fuel\n- The boiler at (x=1.5, y=23.0) is out of fuel. Regularly check fuel levels and refuel entities as needed to maintain operation.\n\n### Errors Due to No Input Liquid\n- The steam engine at (x=17.5, y=20.5) has warnings for no input liquid. Ensure that the fluid system is correctly set up and that water is being supplied from the offshore pump to the boiler and then to the steam engine."}
