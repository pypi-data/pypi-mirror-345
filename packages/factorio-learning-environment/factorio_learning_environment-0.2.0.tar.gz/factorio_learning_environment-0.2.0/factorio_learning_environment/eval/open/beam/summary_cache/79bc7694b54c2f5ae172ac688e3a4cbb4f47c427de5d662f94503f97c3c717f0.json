{"content": "\"\"\"\nThe attempt to craft **Copper Cables** has failed because the required crafting conditions were not met. The error indicates that the crafting process requires a specific machine (like an assembler) to produce Copper Cables, rather than being able to craft them directly from the inventory.\n\n### Current Findings:\n1. **Copper Cables** cannot be crafted directly from the inventory; they require a crafting machine.\n  \n### Next Steps:\n1. **Check for Available Crafting Machines**: I need to see if I have an **Assembling Machine** available or if I can build one.\n2. **Craft an Assembling Machine**: If I don't have one, I will need to craft the necessary components to create an Assembling Machine.\n\nLet\u2019s check the inventory for an Assembling Machine or the components needed to craft one. \n\"\"\"\n\n# Check the inventory for an Assembling Machine or its components\noverall_inventory = inspect_inventory()  # Inspect the overall inventory status\n\n# Check if an Assembling Machine is present\nassembling_machine_count = overall_inventory.get(Prototype.AssemblingMachine, 0)  # Check for existing Assembling Machines\n\nif assembling_machine_count > 0:\n    print(f\"Found {assembling_machine_count} Assembling Machine(s) in inventory.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No Assembling Machines found.
