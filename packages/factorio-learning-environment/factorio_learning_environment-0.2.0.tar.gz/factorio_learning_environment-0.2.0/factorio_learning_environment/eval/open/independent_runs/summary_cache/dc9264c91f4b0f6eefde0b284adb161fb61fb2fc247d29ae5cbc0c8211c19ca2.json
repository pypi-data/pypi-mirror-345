{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (x=-19.0, y=-73.0) with no ingredients to smelt, currently holding 16 copper plates.\n- Furnace at position (x=9.0, y=-64.0) with no ingredients to smelt, currently holding 13 iron plates.\n- Furnace at position (x=6.0, y=-62.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Electricity Generation Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-10.5, y=25.5) working, connected to PipeGroup (fluid system 10175) at position (x=-10.5, y=24.5).\n- Boiler at position (x=-5.5, y=24.0) with no input liquid, not connected.\n- Steam Engine at position (x=-1.5, y=24.5) not generating power, not connected to the power network.\n- Multiple PipeGroups attempting to connect the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine, but facing connection issues.\n\n### Inserter and Storage Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Inserter at position (x=6.5, y=-60.5) not receiving electricity, connected to small electric poles and wooden chests.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=7.5, y=-61.5) and another at position (x=6.5, y=-59.5) with iron plates inventory.\n\n### Research Lab\n- Lab with automation science packs at position (x=6.5, y=-59.5), not receiving power.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Connection Errors with Pipes\n- Ensure that pipes are placed correctly without any blockages to connect the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine. Verify the placement of pipes to ensure they are not blocked by other entities.\n\n### Electrical Connection Issues\n- Ensure that small electric poles are correctly placed and connected to provide power to inserters and the lab. Check for any missing connections or misplacements.\n\n### Steam Engine Not Generating Power\n- Verify that the steam engine is properly connected to the boiler and receiving steam. Ensure that the boiler has a water supply and is generating steam.\n\n### Fluid Network Issues\n- Check the pipe network for any disconnections or blockages that prevent fluid flow. Ensure that the offshore pump is correctly connected to the boiler.\n\n### Assertion Errors\n- Ensure that all components of the electricity generation setup are correctly connected and functional to avoid assertion errors related to the steam engine not generating power."}
