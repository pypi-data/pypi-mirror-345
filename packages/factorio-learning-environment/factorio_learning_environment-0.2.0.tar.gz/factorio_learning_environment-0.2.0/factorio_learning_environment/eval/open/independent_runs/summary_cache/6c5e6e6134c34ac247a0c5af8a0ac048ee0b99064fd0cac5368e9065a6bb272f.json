{"content": "# FACTORIO AGENT REPORT\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System at Position(-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position(-9.5, -0.5)\n- Boiler at position(-5.0, 2.5) - currently out of fuel\n- Steam engine at position(0.5, 6.5)\n- Pipe network connecting these components\n- Small electric pole at position(0.5, 8.5) connected to the steam engine\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Operation at Position(19.5, 71.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill 1 at position(16.5, 71.5) - waiting for space in destination\n- Electric mining drill 2 at position(19.5, 71.5) - working\n- Electric mining drill 3 at position(22.5, 71.5) - working\n- Small electric poles at positions(14.5, 70.5) and (24.5, 73.5) providing power\n- Transport belt system starting from the drills at positions(16.5, 73.5), (17.5, 73.5), (18.5, 73.5), (19.5, 73.5), (21.5, 73.5), (22.5, 73.5)\n- Belt path continuing down to position(16.5, 83.0) and then right to position(20.5, 83.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Area at Position(25.5, 84.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric furnace 1 at position(22.5, 84.5) - no ingredients\n- Electric furnace 2 at position(25.5, 84.5) - no ingredients\n- Electric furnace 3 at position(28.5, 84.5) - no ingredients\n- Connected to the electricity network\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting entities with belts\n- When using `connect_entities()`, ensure there is a valid path between the start and end positions\n- The error \"Not a valid path to normalise\" indicates the path is too complex or impossible to create\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied spaces\n- Check if a position is already occupied before placing an entity\n- Error \"Could not find a suitable position to place transport-belt at the target location, as there is an existing object in the way\" indicates collision with another entity\n- Use `entity already exists at the target position` errors to identify and clear occupied spaces before placing new entities\n\n### Errors when accessing incorrect object attributes\n- The error `'BeltGroup' object has no attribute 'direction'` indicates you're trying to access a property that doesn't exist on that object type\n- BeltGroup is a collection of belts, not a single belt - access individual belts within the group instead\n\n### Mining efficiency issues\n- The warning \"transport belt at drop position is blocked\" indicates that the output belt from mining drill is full or blocked\n- Clear the belt at the drop position to allow mining to continue\n\n## NAMESPACE\nNo functions have been defined by the agent yet."}
