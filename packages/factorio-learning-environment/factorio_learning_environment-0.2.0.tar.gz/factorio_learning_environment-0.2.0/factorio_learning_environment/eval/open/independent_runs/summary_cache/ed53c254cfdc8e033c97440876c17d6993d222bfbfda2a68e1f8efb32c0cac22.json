{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Crude Oil Extraction, Refining and Power Generation Structure at position (17.5, 40.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- PumpJack (position: 17.5, 40.5) extracting crude oil\n- StorageTank (position: 12.5, 40.5 and 17.5, 50.5) storing crude oil and petroleum gas\n- Boiler (position: 22.5, 41.0) generating steam\n- SteamEngine (position: 26.5, 41.5) generating power\n- OilRefinery (position: 17.5, 45.5 and 12.5, 46.5) processing crude oil\n- PipeGroup connecting PumpJack to StorageTank and OilRefinery (positions: 11.5, 38.5 to 18.5, 38.5 and additional pipes at 14.5, 40.5; 15.5, 40.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting Boiler to SteamEngine (positions: 22.5, 39.5 to 29.5, 39.5 and 29.5, 41.5)\n- ElectricityGroup connecting SteamEngine to PumpJack and OilRefinery (poles at positions: 26.5, 43.5; 20.5, 41.5; 22.5, 43.5; 10.5, 52.5; 19.5, 53.5; 14.5, 42.5; 21.5, 51.5; 12.5, 54.5; 16.5, 54.5 and additional poles)\n- OffshorePump (position: -9.5, -0.5 and -9.5, 1.5)\n\n#### New Water Supply Structure\nConsists of the following entities:\n- OffshorePump (position: -9.5, 1.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n* Errors when placing entities:\n  - Could not place pipe-to-ground at (16.5, 40.5) because there is an existing object in the way. Ensure the target location is clear before placing an entity.\n  - Could not place pipe-to-ground at (12.5, 40.5) because there is an existing object in the way. Ensure the target location is clear before placing an entity.\n  - Could not place pipe at (15.5, 40.5) because entity already exists at the target position. Remove the existing entity before continuing.\n  - Could not place pipe-to-ground at (14.5, 40.5) because entity already exists at the target position. Remove the existing entity before continuing.\n  - Could not place pipe at (13.5, 45.5) because there is an existing object in the way. Ensure the target location is clear before placing an entity.\n* Errors when connecting entities:\n  - Did not find any valid connections between source Prototype.OffshorePump at x=-9.5 y=1.5 and target Prototype.Boiler at x=22.5 y=41.0. Make sure none of the source or target connections points are blocked and the target is able to receive the fluid from the source.\n* Errors when using undefined variables:\n  - NameError: name 'entity' is not defined. Ensure that all variables are defined before using them.\n  - NameError: name 'to' is not defined. Ensure that all variables are defined before using them.\n* Errors when using incorrect arguments:\n  - ValueError: The first argument must be an Entity or Prototype object. Ensure that the correct type of argument is passed to the function.\n* Errors when getting entities:\n  - No entity of type offshore-pump found at the specified position. Ensure that the entity exists at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it.\n* Tips:\n  - Ensure that the entity has the attribute or method you are trying to access.\n  - Check if the entity is valid and if the inventory can be inspected before attempting to inspect it.\n  - Ensure that entities are properly connected to the power network.\n  - AttributeError: 'PumpJack' object has no attribute 'fuel'. Ensure that you are accessing the correct attribute.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n* No utility functions have been defined by the agent."}
