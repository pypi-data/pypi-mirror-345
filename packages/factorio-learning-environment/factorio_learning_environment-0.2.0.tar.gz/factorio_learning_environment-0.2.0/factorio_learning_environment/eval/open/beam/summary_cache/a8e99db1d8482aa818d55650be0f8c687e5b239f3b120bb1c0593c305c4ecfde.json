{"content": "Ah, I see the real issue now. We don't have any stone in our inventory. We need to:\n1. Find stone resources\n2. Mine some stone\n3. Then craft the stone furnace\n\nLet's do this step by step:\n\n```python\n# First find nearest stone resource\nstone_pos = nearest(Resource.Stone)\nprint(f\"Found stone at position: {stone_pos}\")\n\n# Move to the stone\nmove_to(stone_pos)\nprint(f\"Moved to stone position\")\n\n# Mine some stone (we need at least 5)\nmine(stone_pos)\nprint(\"Mining stone...\")\n\n# Wait a bit for mining to complete\n# Check our inventory\ninventory = inspect_inventory()\nprint(f\"Current inventory: {inventory}\")\n\n# Now try to craft the stone furnace\nif inventory.get(Prototype.Stone, 0) >= 5:\n    craft_item(Prototype.StoneFurnace, quantity=1)\n    print(\"Successfully crafted stone furnace\")\n    \n    # Check if we can now craft the burner mining drill\n    inventory = inspect_inventory()\n    if (inventory.get(Prototype.IronPlate, 0) >= 3 and \n        inventory.get(Prototype.IronGearWheel, 0) >= 3 and \n        inventory.get(Prototype.StoneFurnace, 0) >= 1):\n        craft_item(Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill)\n        print(\"Successfully crafted burner mining drill\")\nelse:\n    print(f\"Still need more stone. Have: {inventory.get(Prototype.Stone, 0)}, need: 5\")\n\n# Final inventory check\nfinal_inventory = inspect_inventory()\nprint(f\"Final inventory: {final_inventory}\")\n```\n\nThis should help us get the stone we need to craft the stone furnace. Let me know if you'd like me to modify this approach or if you see any other issues we should address.", "summary_range": "[1-2432]"}
