{"content": "## Report\n\n### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 19.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Steam Engine** at position (-5.5, 19.5)\n- **Boiler** at position (-2.5, 24.0)\n- **Offshore Pump** at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- **PipeGroup** connecting the boiler to the steam engine with pipes at positions from (-5.5, 16.5) to (-2.5, 22.5)\n- **PipeGroup** for water supply from the offshore pump to the boiler at positions from (-8.5, 23.5) to (-4.5, 24.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Undefined Variables\n- Ensure all variables are defined before using them in expressions. For example, `steam_engine_buildable_area` was not defined before use.\n\n#### Type Errors in Calculations\n- When performing arithmetic operations, ensure that all operands are of compatible types. For instance, avoid adding `ModelPrivateAttr` to an `int`.\n\n#### Crafting Errors Due to Missing Ingredients\n- Verify that all required ingredients are available in the inventory before attempting to craft items. For example, crafting a steam engine failed due to missing iron plates and iron gear wheels.\n\n#### Placement Errors Due to Inventory Shortage\n- Ensure that the necessary items are available in the inventory before attempting to place entities. For instance, placing a steam engine failed due to its absence in the inventory.\n\n#### Connection Errors Due to Inventory Shortage\n- Before attempting to connect entities with pipes, ensure that the required pipes are available in the inventory.\n\n#### Insertion Errors Due to Inventory Shortage\n- Confirm that the items to be inserted are present in the inventory. For example, inserting coal into the boiler failed due to a lack of coal in the inventory.\n\n#### Crafting Machine Requirement\n- Some items require a crafting machine or smelting in a furnace. Ensure the appropriate setup is available for crafting items like iron plates and iron gear wheels."}
