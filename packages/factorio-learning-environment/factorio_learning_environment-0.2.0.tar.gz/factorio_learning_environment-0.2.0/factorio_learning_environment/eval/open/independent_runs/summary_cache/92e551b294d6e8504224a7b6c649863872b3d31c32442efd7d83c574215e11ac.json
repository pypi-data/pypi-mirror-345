{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report - Steps 0-95\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation (Water -> Steam -> Electricity) with Automated Coal Fueling\n*   **Purpose:** Generates electricity from water using coal as fuel, with an automated system to transport coal from the main coal mine.\n*   **Components:**\n    *   Offshore Pump at x=-9.5 y=-0.5 (Extracts water, Status: WORKING)\n    *   Boiler at x=-5.0 y=2.5 (Heats water to steam using coal, Status: NO_FUEL)\n    *   Steam Engine at x=0.5 y=6.5 (Generates electricity from steam, Status: NOT_CONNECTED)\n    *   PipeGroup connecting Offshore Pump to Boiler (fluid_system=20386, fluid=water, status=FULL_OUTPUT)\n    *   PipeGroup connecting Boiler to Steam Engine (fluid_system=20393, status=EMPTY)\n    *   **Boiler Fueling Subsystem:**\n        *   Wooden Chest (Fuel Buffer) at x=-3.5 y=7.5 (Status: NORMAL, Inventory: Empty)\n        *   Inserter (Belt -> Fuel Chest) at x=-3.5 y=8.5 (Picks from belt at x=-3.5 y=9.5, Drops to chest at x=-3.5 y=7.5, Status: NO_POWER)\n        *   Inserter (Fuel Chest -> Boiler) at x=-3.5 y=6.5 (Picks from chest at x=-3.5 y=7.5, Drops to Boiler at x=-3.5 y=5.5, Status: NO_POWER)\n        *   **Coal Transport Belt (In Progress):** Attempting to connect the main coal mine output (via inserter at x=16.5 y=3.5) to the boiler fueling inserter (pickup at x=-3.5 y=9.5).\n            *   Inserter (Intermediate Chest -> Belt) at x=16.5 y=3.5 (Picks from chest at x=15.5 y=3.5, Drops to belt at x=17.5 y=3.5, Status: NO_POWER)\n            *   Belt segment at x=17.5 y=3.5 (Direction: DOWN)\n            *   Belt segment at x=-3.5 y=9.5 (Direction: UP)\n            *   Partially built BeltGroup from x=17.5 y=4.5 to x=14.5 y=9.5 (10 belts)\n            *   Partially built BeltGroup from x=10.5 y=9.5 to x=5.5 y=9.5 (6 belts)\n            *   Belt segment at x=3.5 y=9.5 (Direction: LEFT)\n            *   *Note: Connection attempts using `connect_entities` failed repeatedly. Manual belt placement is ongoing but encountering obstructions.*\n\n"}
