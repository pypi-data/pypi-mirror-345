Although attempts were made to supply or craft a Lab at Position(x=0.5, y=2.5), none succeeded due to inventory and resource issues. Pre\u2010existing smelting facilities (for example, the furnace at Position(x=5.0, y=5.0) and the copper furnace at Position(x=-27.0, y=-60.0)) were referenced for processing raw materials, but no additional structure was placed.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 API Parameter Misuse \u2013 Incorrectly calling get_entities. In some attempts a keyword argument \u201cradius\u201d was passed even though the function did not expect it, and later positional parameters were used when none are expected. Always verify the API\u2019s signature and use proper arguments.\n  \n\u2022 Iteration on None \u2013 When filtering retrieved entities (e.g. labs) the code attempted to iterate over a NoneType. Ensure that the return value is validated (or defaulted to an empty list) before iterating.\n  \n\u2022 Placement without Inventory \u2013 Repeated attempts to place a Lab at Position(x=0.5, y=2.5) failed because no Lab was available in inventory. Confirm that the required item exists in inventory before attempting placement.\n  \n\u2022 Lab Crafting Resource Shortages \u2013 Multiple crafting errors for the Lab occurred due to missing sub-ingredients (such as iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, and copper-cables). Verify that all sub-components are available or can be produced (through proper smelting or assembling processes) before initiating a Lab craft.\n  \n\u2022 Cross-Checking Resource Quantities \u2013 Crafting failures indicating insufficient ingredients (for example, missing iron-gear-wheels or copper-plate for copper-cable production) highlight the need to compare available resources against recipe requirements before starting production."}
