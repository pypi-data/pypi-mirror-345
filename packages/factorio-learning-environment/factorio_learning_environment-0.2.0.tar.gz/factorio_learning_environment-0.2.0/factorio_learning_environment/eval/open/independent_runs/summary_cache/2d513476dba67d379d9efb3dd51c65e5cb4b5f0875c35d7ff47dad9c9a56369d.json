{"content": "# FACTORIO REPORT\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System at position (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump (position x=-9.5, y=-0.5)\n- Boiler (position x=-5.0, y=2.5)\n- Steam engine (position x=0.5, y=6.5)\n- Pipe network connecting these components\n- Central power pole (position x=0.5, y=10.5)\n\nThis structure generates electricity for the factory by pumping water from a nearby water source, heating it in the boiler using coal to produce steam, which then powers the steam engine.\n\n### Stone Mining Operation at position (-50.0, 13.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill 1 (position x=-48.5, y=7.5) with wooden chest (position x=-48.5, y=9.5)\n- Electric mining drill 2 (position x=-51.5, y=12.5) with wooden chest (position x=-51.5, y=14.5)\n- Electric mining drill 3 (position x=-48.5, y=16.5) with wooden chest (position x=-48.5, y=18.5)\n- Electric mining drill 4 (position x=-52.5, y=18.5) with wooden chest (position x=-52.5, y=20.5)\n- Small electric poles connecting the drills to the power network\n\nThis structure mines stone from several stone patches and deposits it into adjacent wooden chests for storage.\n\n### Stone Brick Production Line at position (-20.0, 35.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace 1 (position x=-30.0, y=35.0) with output inserter (position x=-29.5, y=36.5)\n- Stone furnace 2 (position x=-25.0, y=35.0) with output inserter (position x=-24.5, y=36.5)\n- Stone furnace 3 (position x=-20.0, y=35.0) with output inserter (position x=-19.5, y=36.5)\n- Stone furnace 4 (position x=-15.0, y=35.0) with output inserter (position x=-14.5, y=36.5)\n- Stone furnace 5 (position x=-10.0, y=35.0) with output inserter (position x=-9.5, y=36.5)\n- Input belt segments at x=-34.5, y=33.5 and other positions\n- Output belt segments at x=-34.5, y=37.5 and other positions\n- Furnace area power pole (position x=-19.5, y=30.5)\n\nThis structure smelts stone into stone bricks. The furnaces are fueled with coal and have inserters to output the stone bricks onto transport belts.\n\n### Standalone Stone Furnace at position (-30.0, 25.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace (position x=-30.0, y=25.0)\n\nThis is a standalone stone furnace that has been placed but is not currently part of a production line.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities on unsuitable terrain\n- Before placing entities, check if the terrain is suitable (not water or other unplaceable terrain)\n- Use the map view to identify suitable areas for building before attempting to place structures\n\n### Errors when connecting entities with belts\n- When using connect_entities for transport belts, ensure the path between start and end points is valid\n- Use smaller segments for belt connections rather than trying to connect long distances at once\n- Make sure the coordinates for belt connections are properly aligned (whole numbers for x and y)\n\n### Errors when placing entities near existing objects\n- Check for existing objects before placing new entities\n- Leave sufficient space between structures to avoid placement conflicts\n- Consider using a grid-based approach for planning factory layouts\n\n### Errors with power connections\n- Ensure all electrical entities are properly connected to the power network\n- Place electric poles within connection range of each other and the devices they need to power\n- Check for \"not connected to power network\" warnings in entity status\n\n### Errors with inserter placement\n- When placing inserters, ensure they have clear pickup and drop positions\n- Position inserters correctly relative to belts and machines (check direction)\n- Leave sufficient space around machines for inser"}
