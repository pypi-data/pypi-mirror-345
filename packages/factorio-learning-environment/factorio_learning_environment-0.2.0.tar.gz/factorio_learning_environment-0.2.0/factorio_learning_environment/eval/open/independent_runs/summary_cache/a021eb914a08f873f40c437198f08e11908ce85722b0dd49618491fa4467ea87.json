{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Setup at Position (x=2.0, y=-63.0)\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=2.0, y=-63.0): Extracts iron ore and drops it into a chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=2.5, y=-61.5): Collects iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=3.5, y=-61.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=4.0, y=-63.0): Smelts iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=4.5, y=-61.5): Stores excess iron ore (currently full).\n\n#### Additional Stone Furnace at Position (x=6.0, y=-63.0)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=6.0, y=-63.0): Currently idle due to lack of ingredients.\n\n---\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when extracting items from a furnace\n- **Issue**: Repeated errors when attempting to extract iron plates from the furnace at (x=4.0, y=-63.0). The furnace either has no iron plates or is out of fuel.\n- **Solution**: Ensure the furnace has sufficient fuel and iron ore to produce plates before attempting extraction. Monitor the furnace's status and inventory.\n\n#### Errors when inserting items into a furnace\n- **Issue**: Failed to insert iron ore into the furnace at (x=4.0, y=-63.0) because the furnace's source inventory was full.\n- **Solution**: Check the furnace's source inventory before inserting items. If full, extract the smelted plates to free up space.\n\n#### Errors when crafting items\n- **Issue**: Failed to craft iron gear wheels due to insufficient resources or incorrect crafting setup.\n- **Solution**: Ensure all required resources (e.g., iron plates) are available in the inventory before initiating crafting.\n\n#### Errors when picking up entities\n- **Issue**: Failed to pick up a chest due to a full inventory.\n- **Solution**: Clear inventory space before attempting to pick up entities.\n\n#### Errors due to full chests\n- **Issue**: The chest at (x=4.5, y=-61.5) is full, causing the inserter to stop transferring items.\n- **Solution**: Empty the chest periodically to allow continuous operation of the mining and smelting setup."}
