{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-25.0, y=-64.0) connected to a transport belt at (x=-25.5, y=-65.5) and further belts leading to a **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-19.0, y=-65.0).\n- **Transport Belt** network from (x=-26.5, y=-65.5) to (x=-12.5, y=-58.5) with various directional changes to facilitate the movement of materials.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-17.5, y=-64.5) transferring items from the transport belt to the stone furnace.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-16.5, y=-64.5) storing produced iron plates.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Site\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0) extracting iron ore into a **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-54.5).\n\n### Coal Mining Site\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=53.0, y=-83.0) extracting coal into a **Wooden Chest** at position (x=52.5, y=-84.5).\n\n### Additional Structures\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with no current ingredients to smelt.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=2.5, y=0.5) waiting for source items from a **Wooden Chest** at position (x=1.5, y=0.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the inserters have a continuous supply of items to transfer. Check the input source and ensure it is providing the necessary materials.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Not Producing\n- Verify that the furnace has both fuel and the necessary raw materials to produce the desired output. Check the supply lines and ensure they are functioning correctly.\n\n### Errors with Belt Connections\n- Ensure all belts are correctly connected and oriented to facilitate the smooth flow of materials from source to destination. Misalignment or breaks in the belt network can disrupt production."}
