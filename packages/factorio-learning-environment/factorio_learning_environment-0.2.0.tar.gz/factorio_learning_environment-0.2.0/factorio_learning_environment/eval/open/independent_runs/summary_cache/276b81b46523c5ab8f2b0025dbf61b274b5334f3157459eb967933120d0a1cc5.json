{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power generation facility at x=-9.5 to x=-2.5\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump (x=-9.5, y=-0.5)\n- Boiler (x=-6.5, y=0.0) - currently out of fuel\n- Steam engine (x=-2.5, y=0.5) - not connected to power network\n\n### Oil production facility at x=17.5 to x=37.5\nConsists of:\n- Pumpjack (x=17.5, y=40.5) - not receiving electricity\n- Oil refinery (x=27.5, y=40.5) - not receiving electricity, set to BasicOilProcessing recipe\n- Storage tank (x=32.5, y=40.5) - contains petroleum gas\n- Chemical plant (x=37.5, y=40.5) - not receiving electricity, set to PlasticBar recipe\n- Wooden chest with coal (x=37.5, y=37.5)\n- Inserter (x=37.5, y=38.5) - not receiving electricity, connects chest to chemical plant\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Incorrect prototype naming\n- Use `Prototype.PumpJack` instead of `Prototype.Pumpjack` when placing pumpjacks\n\n### Entity connection errors\n- Set recipes on buildings before connecting pipes:\n  - Oil refineries need `BasicOilProcessing` or other recipe set before pipe connections\n  - Chemical plants need recipes like `PlasticBar` set before pipe connections\n\n### Fluid system issues\n- Ensure source entities have fluid before connecting to chemical plants\n- Check fluid box contents before making connections\n\n### Power issues\n- Connect all buildings to power poles before operation:\n  - Pumpjack at x=17.5 y=40.5 has no power\n  - Oil refinery at x=27.5 y=40.5 has no power\n  - Chemical plant at x=37.5 y=40.5 has no power\n  - Inserter at x=37.5 y=38.5 has no power\n\n### Fuel management\n- Keep boilers fueled with coal or other fuel sources\n- Current boiler at x=-6.5 y=0.0 is out of fuel\n\n### Entity inspection\n- Verify entity has inventory before attempting inspection\n- Storage tanks need fluid contents to inspect properly\n\n### Production verification\n- Check entity status after placement and connection:\n  - Use `EntityStatus.WORKING` as success indicator\n  - Handle other statuses like `FLUID_INGREDIENT_SHORTAGE` appropriately"}
