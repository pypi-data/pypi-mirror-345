{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Setup at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and places it into a nearby chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities too far from the player\n- Ensure that the player is within the maximum allowable distance (10 units) from the target position before attempting to place an entity. Move closer to the target position to avoid this error.\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied tiles\n- Before placing an entity, verify that the target tile is unoccupied by other entities. Adjust the spacing, direction, or reference position to prevent collisions with existing entities.\n\n### Inserter Setup Errors\n- Double-check the alignment and direction of inserters to ensure they are correctly positioned to transfer items between entities. Misalignment can prevent items from being transferred.\n\n### Refueling Errors\n- Regularly check and refuel entities like mining drills, inserters, and furnaces to ensure continuous operation. Lack of fuel can halt production processes.\n\n### Inventory Management\n- Monitor the inventory of chests and ensure they have enough space to store incoming resources. Full chests can block production and require manual intervention to clear space."}
