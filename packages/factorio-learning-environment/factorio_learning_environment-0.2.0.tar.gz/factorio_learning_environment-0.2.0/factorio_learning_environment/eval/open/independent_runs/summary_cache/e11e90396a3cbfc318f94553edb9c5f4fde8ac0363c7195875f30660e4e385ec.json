{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Neighbours: Stone Furnace\n  - Drop Position: (-16.5, -52.5)\n  - Resources: 40,000 units of Iron Ore\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-14.0, -49.0)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Fuel: 7 units of Coal\n  - Furnace Source: 9 units of Iron Ore\n  - Furnace Result: 45 units of Iron Plates\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities without having them in inventory\n- Ensure you have the required entity in your inventory before attempting to place it. For example, attempting to place a burner-mining-drill without having one in the inventory will result in an error.\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied or invalid locations\n- Verify that the desired location is free and suitable for the entity you are trying to place. This includes checking for existing entities or terrain that might block placement.\n\n### Furnace setup issues\n- If the furnace is not producing iron plates, double-check the setup to ensure it is correctly configured with the necessary resources and fuel. Ensure that the input and output paths are correctly aligned and that the furnace has sufficient fuel to operate.\n\n### General placement errors\n- When placing entities such as Wooden Chests, Transport Belts, or Burner Inserters, ensure that the location is valid and not occupied by another entity or obstruction."}
