{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage Facility at Position (4.0, -60.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (4.0, -60.0) with a drop position at (4.5, -58.5), currently out of fuel and unable to mine due to a full chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (4.5, -58.5) containing 494 iron ore.\n- Multiple Wooden Chests at positions (5.5, -60.5), (7.5, -60.5), (6.5, -60.5), (9.5, -60.5), and (8.5, -60.5), each containing 183 iron plates.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chests at positions (-4.5, -52.5) and (-5.5, -52.5), containing 500 iron plates and 232 iron ore, respectively.\n- Iron Chest at position (-3.5, -52.5) containing 1476 iron plates.\n- Wooden Chests at positions (-2.5, -52.5), (-14.5, -50.5), (-13.5, -50.5), (-12.5, -50.5), (-11.5, -50.5), (-10.5, -50.5), (-9.5, -50.5), (-8.5, -50.5), (-7.5, -50.5), and (-6.5, -50.5), containing various amounts of iron plates and iron ore.\n- Iron Chest at position (-5.5, -50.5) containing 326 iron ore and 1500 iron plates.\n\n### Iron Smelting Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -48.0) with coal as fuel, currently unable to smelt due to no ingredients.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0) with coal as fuel, currently unable to smelt due to no ingredients.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0) with coal as fuel, currently unable to smelt due to no ingredients.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Out of Fuel\n- Ensure that all Burner Mining Drills have sufficient fuel to operate. Regularly check fuel levels and replenish as necessary.\n\n### Errors Due to Full Chests\n- Regularly monitor chest inventories and clear out or expand storage as needed to prevent mining operations from halting due to full chests.\n\n### Errors Due to No Ingredients in Furnaces\n- Ensure that stone furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Regularly supply furnaces with the required raw materials to maintain production.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined by the agent in the given steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `final_inventory`: Dict[str, int] = {'wooden-chest': 2, 'iron-ore': 100, 'iron-plate': 7500, 'iron-gear-wheel': 4}"}
