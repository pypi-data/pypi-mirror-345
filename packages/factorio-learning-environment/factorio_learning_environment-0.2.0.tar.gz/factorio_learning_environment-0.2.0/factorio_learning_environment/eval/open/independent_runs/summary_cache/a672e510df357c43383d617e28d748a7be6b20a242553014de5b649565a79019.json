{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-15.5, -48.5) and (-14.5, -48.5) for temporary storage of extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5) transferring iron ore to the processing area.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (-12.0, -48.0) and (-10.0, -48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-14.5, -46.5) for storing iron ore and (-10.5, -46.5) for storing iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserters** at positions (-14.5, -47.5), (-11.5, -46.5), (-11.5, -45.5), and (-8.5, -47.5) facilitating the movement of materials between chests and furnaces.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-6.5, -49.5), (-6.5, -48.5), (-5.5, -48.5), (-4.5, -48.5), (-3.5, -48.5), (-7.5, -48.5), and (-6.5, -47.5) for storing iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-8.5, -47.5) transferring iron plates to storage.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inventory Management\n- Ensure that there are enough items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities. For example, attempting to insert coal or iron plates without having them in the inventory will result in an error.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Make sure that the source items are available for inserters to transfer. Regularly check the supply chain to ensure that there are no bottlenecks.\n\n### Storage Overflow\n- Monitor storage chests to prevent them from becoming full. Consider adding additional storage chests when existing ones are nearing capacity to avoid overflow issues.\n\n### Refueling Errors\n- Regularly check and refuel all burner entities to ensure continuous operation. Keep an adequate supply of fuel in your inventory to avoid interruptions.\n\n### Iron Ore Transfer Issues\n- Ensure that the transfer of iron ore from storage to furnaces is continuous. Address any interruptions promptly to maintain smelting efficiency."}
