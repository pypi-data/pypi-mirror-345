{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Mining and Smelting Complex\n- Burner mining drill at (-15.0, -50.0) connected to wooden chest at (-14.5, -48.5) containing 324 iron ore\n- Multiple furnaces for iron plate production:\n  - Furnace at (0.0, 0.0) with 5 iron plates\n  - Furnace at (2.0, 0.0) with 35 iron plates\n  - Furnace at (4.0, 4.0) with 5 iron plates\n  - Furnace at (6.0, 4.0) with 35 iron plates\n\n### Copper Processing Area\n- Furnace at (-14.0, -47.0) actively smelting copper ore (16 ore, 4 plates in progress)\n\n### Automation Science Pack Production Line\n- Assembling machine at (24.5, 4.5) set up for automation science pack production\n- Input chest at (21.5, 4.5) with burner inserter at (22.5, 4.5)\n- Output chest at (27.5, 4.5) containing 51 iron gear wheels with burner inserter at (26.5, 4.5)\n- Connected to electricity network via multiple small electric poles\n\n### Power Generation System\n- Steam engine at (9.5, 19.5)\n- Boiler at (-2.0, 23.5) containing water at 15\u00b0C\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, 24.5) actively pumping water\n- Two pipe networks:\n  - Network 26105: Empty pipes connecting boiler output\n  - Network 26107: Water-filled pipes connecting offshore pump to boiler\n- Electric network (id 41427) connecting multiple poles but currently not powered\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Power System Issues\n- Steam engine not receiving steam due to disconnected or improperly configured pipe network\n- Boiler needs fuel to heat water and generate steam\n\n### Production Line Issues\n- Assembling machine not receiving power, ensure proper electrical connections\n- Missing resources for automation science pack production (copper plates and iron gear wheels)\n\n### Resource Management\n- Multiple furnaces are idle due to lack of input materials\n- Burner mining drill out of fuel, needs coal to continue operation\n\n### Crafting Issues\n- Ensure sufficient materials before attempting to craft items\n- When crafting items requiring machine processing (like copper plates), use appropriate production facilities instead of manual crafting\n\n### Lab Placement Issues\n- Cannot place lab while it is being crafted/processed\n- Ensure lab is fully crafted before attempting placement\n- Verify inventory contains the lab before attempting placement"}
