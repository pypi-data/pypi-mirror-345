This will prevent assertion errors related to insufficient iron ore quantities.\n\n### Fuel Management for Mining Drills\n- Regularly check and refuel mining drills to prevent them from running out of fuel, which halts resource extraction.\n\n### Ingredient Management for Furnaces\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to process. This will prevent the furnace from being idle due to a lack of ingredients to smelt."}
