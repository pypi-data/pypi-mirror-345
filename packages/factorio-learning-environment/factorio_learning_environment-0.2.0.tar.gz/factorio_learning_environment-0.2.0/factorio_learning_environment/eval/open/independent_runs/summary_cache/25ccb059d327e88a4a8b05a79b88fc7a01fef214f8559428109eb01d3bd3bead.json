{"content": "Here is the updated report:\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Partial Power Plant at (100,100) (Updated)\n- **Boiler** at (103.0, 100.5) - Steam production (fueled with coal)\n- **Steam engine** at (106.5, 100.5) - Power generation (unconnected)\n- **Stone furnace** at (100.0, 100.0) - Smelting (inactive, no ingredients)\n- **Offshore pump** at (-9.5, -0.5) - Water source (unconnected)\n\n### New Build Attempt at Origin (New)\n- Partial smelting setup (positions unknown)\n- Failed power system attempts\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Prototype Access Errors (Critical)\n- Repeated attempts to access non-existent Prototype.Player\n- Required fixes:\n  1. Use correct prototype names\n  2. Verify prototype existence before use\n  3. Implement error handling for invalid prototypes\n\n### Fluid System Failures (Persistent)\n- 12+ pipe placement failures due to:\n  1. Collisions at (104.5,100.5), (104.0,100.5), etc.\n  2. Incorrect underground pipe usage\n  3. Blocked connection points\n- Required solutions:\n  1. Implement pre-placement collision checks\n  2. Use proper pipe spacing (1 tile minimum)\n  3. Verify fluid connection directions\n\n### Build Location Management (New)\n- Multiple failed fresh starts due to:\n  1. Not clearing existing entities\n  2. Attempting builds at occupied locations\n  3. Inconsistent coordinate systems\n- Required fixes:\n  1. Implement systematic cleanup\n  2. Use integer grid coordinates\n  3. Maintain build area tracking\n\n### Insertion Failures (New)\n- Repeated copper plate insertion failures\n- Core issues:\n  1. Missing target assemblers\n  2. No valid insertion paths\n  3. Production chain gaps\n- Required solutions:\n  1. Complete production lines before insertion\n  2. Verify target entity existence\n  3. Implement inserter validation\n\n### Previous Unresolved Issues\n- Power plant still unconnected\n- Furnace remains inactive\n- No functional production lines\n- Prototype access errors persist\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Important Variables\n- `boiler`: Primary steam producer at (103.0, 100.5)\n- `steam_engine`: Unconnected generator at (106.5, 100.5)\n- `furnace`: Inactive smelter at (100.0, 100.0)\n- `offshore_pump`: Unused water source at (-9.5, -0.5)\n\n### Function Status\n- `find_clear_land_near_power()` remains unused\n- No new functions defined\n- Critical need for position validation utilities"}
