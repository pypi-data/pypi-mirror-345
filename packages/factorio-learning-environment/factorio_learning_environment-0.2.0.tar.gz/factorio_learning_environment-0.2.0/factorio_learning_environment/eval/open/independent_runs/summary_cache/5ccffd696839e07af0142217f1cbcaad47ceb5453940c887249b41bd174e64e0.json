{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=22.5, y=-7.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=22.5, y=-7.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=20.5, y=-4.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=19.5, y=-1.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine, with various pipes at positions (e.g., x=20.5, y=-5.5; x=24.5, y=-5.5)\n- Small Electric Pole at position (x=24.5, y=-7.5)\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=2.0, y=0.0) with coal fuel\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=5.0, y=5.0) with coal fuel\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with coal fuel\n\n### Inserter and Storage System\nConsists of:\n- Inserter at position (x=-3.5, y=1.5) awaiting source items and without power\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-3.5, y=0.5)\n- Small Electric Poles at positions (x=-2.5, y=2.5) and (x=-3.5, y=2.5)\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- PipeGroup at position (x=19.5, y=-12.5) for steam distribution\n- PipeGroup at position (x=5.5, y=-8.5) for water distribution\n- PipeGroup at position (x=18.5, y=-3.5) for water distribution\n\n### Electricity Networks\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at various positions (e.g., x=16.5, y=-13.5; x=23.5, y=-12.5) with voltage 66\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at various positions (e.g., x=-5.5, y=1.5; x=-3.5, y=3.5) with voltage 0\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Steam Engine Connection\n- Ensure that all components of the electricity generator are properly connected. Verify the connection between the steam engine, boiler, and offshore pump to prevent the \"Steam engine is not properly connected\" error.\n\n### Inserter Power Supply Issues\n- Make sure that inserters are connected to a power source. Check the electricity network to ensure that the inserter at position (x=-3.5, y=1.5) receives power.\n\n### Boiler Fuel Management\n- Regularly check and refuel the boiler at position (x=20.5, y=-4.0) to avoid the \"out of fuel\" warning and ensure continuous operation of the electricity generator."}
