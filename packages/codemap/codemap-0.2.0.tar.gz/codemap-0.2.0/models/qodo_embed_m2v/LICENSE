QodoAI Open RAIL++-M License
Last Updated: February 19, 2025
Section I: PREAMBLE
This Open RAIL++-M License applies to Licensor's code embedding and integrity multimodal generative AI models.  
This License strives for both the open and responsible downstream use of the Qodo Model accompanying this License. The openness here means enabling users of the Qodo Models to generally make royalty-free and subscription fee-free use of the applicable Qodo Model, modify and creative Derivatives thereof, while complying with use-based restrictions not permitting the use of the Qodo Model in very specific to ensure responsible use. While Derivatives of the Qodo Model can be released under different licensing terms, the latter will always have to include - at minimum - the same use-based restrictions as the ones in the original License.
This License governs the use of Qodo Models (and their Derivatives) and is informed by the model card associated with the relevant Qodo Model accompanying this License.
NOW THEREFORE, You and Licensor agree as follows:
1. Definitions
(a) "License" means these terms and conditions for use, reproduction, and Distribution of the Qodo Models and their Derivatives, as defined herein. For the avoidance of doubt, Data and source code are not licensed under this License. 
(b) "Data" means a collection of information and/or content extracted from the dataset used with the Qodo Model, including to train, pretrain, or otherwise evaluate the Qodo Model. The Data is not licensed under this License.
(c) "Output" means the results of operating a Qodo Model as embodied in informational content resulting therefrom.
(d) "Qodo Model" means any accompanying machine-learning based assemblies (including checkpoints), consisting of learnt weights, parameters (including optimizer states), corresponding to the model architecture as embodied in the Complementary Material, that have been trained or tuned, in whole or in part on the Data, using the Complementary Material. 
(e) "Derivatives" means all modifications to the Qodo Model, works based on the Qodo Model, or any other model which is created or initialized by transfer of patterns of the weights, parameters, activations or output of the Qodo Model, to the other model, in order to cause the other model to perform similarly to the Qodo Model, including - but not limited to - distillation methods entailing the use of intermediate data representations or methods based on the generation of synthetic data by the Qodo Model for training the other model.
(f) "Complementary Material" means the accompanying scripts used to define, run, load, benchmark or evaluate the Qodo Model, and used to prepare data for training or evaluation, if any. This includes any accompanying documentation, tutorials, examples, etc, if any.
(g) "Distribution" means any transmission, reproduction, publication or other sharing of the Qodo Model or Derivatives of the Qodo Model to a third party, including providing the Qodo Model as a hosted or cloud service made available by electronic or other remote means - e.g. API-based or web-access.
(h) "Licensor", "Qodo" or "QodoAI" means Codium Ltd. (dba Qodo), or any corporate affiliate of Qodo authorized by it that is granting this License to You. 
(i) "You" (or "Your") means an individual or legal entity exercising permissions granted by this License and/or making use of the Qodo Model for whichever purpose and in any field of use, including commercial usage of the Qodo Model in an end-use application - e.g. chatbot, translator, code generator. If You are accepting this License on behalf of a company or another legal entity, you represent that You have the authority to bind such legal entity to this License. 
(j) "Third Parties" means individuals or legal entities that are not under common control with Licensor or You.
(k) "Contribution" means any work of authorship, including the original version of the Qodo Model and any modifications or additions to that Model or Derivatives of the Qodo Model thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Qodo Model by the copyright owner or by an individual or legal entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Qodo Model, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
(l) "Contributor" means Licensor and any individual or legal entity on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated within the Qodo Model.
Section II: INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS
Both copyright and patent grants apply to the Qodo Model, Derivatives of the Qodo Model and Complementary Material. The Qodo Model and Derivatives of the Qodo Model are subject to additional terms as described in Section III.
2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, copyright license to reproduce, prepare, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Complementary Material, the Qodo Model, and Derivatives of the Qodo Model.
3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License and where and as applicable, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, (except as stated in this paragraph) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Qodo Model and the Complementary Material, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Qodo Model to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. 
4. Termination for IP Claims. If You institute litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Qodo Model and/or Complementary Material or a Contribution incorporated within the Qodo Model and/or Complementary Material constitutes direct or contributory intellectual rights (including copyright or patent) infringement, then any licenses granted to You under this License for the Qodo Model and/or Derivatives shall terminate as of the date such litigation is asserted or filed.
       Section III: CONDITIONS OF USAGE, DISTRIBUTION AND REDISTRIBUTION
