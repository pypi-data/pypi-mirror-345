{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=20.5, y=-4.0)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (x=22.5, y=-7.5)\n- Boiler at Position (x=20.5, y=-4.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (x=4.5, y=-10.5)\n- Pipe Network connecting these entities\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (x=-11.0, y=20.0) with a Wooden Chest at Position (x=-11.5, y=18.5)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0) and another at Position (x=2.0, y=0.0)\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (x=20.0, y=20.0) with a Wooden Chest at Position (x=19.5, y=18.5)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=5.0, y=5.0)\n\n### Copper Cable Factory\nConsists of:\n- Assembling Machine at Position (x=10.5, y=0.5)\n- Inserter at Position (x=7.5, y=5.5) feeding into a Wooden Chest at Position (x=8.5, y=5.5)\n- Belt Group connecting the Furnace at Position (x=5.0, y=5.0) to the Assembling Machine at Position (x=10.5, y=0.5)\n\n### Storage and Transport System\nConsists of:\n- Multiple Wooden Chests for storage at various positions\n- Inserters and Transport Belts for item movement\n\n### Water Supply System\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (x=19.5, y=-1.5)\n- Pipe Network distributing water\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of:\n- Multiple Small Electric Poles connecting various entities\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Extracting Items\n- Ensure the entity contains the item before attempting extraction. For example, check if the Assembling Machine at Position (x=10.5, y=0.5) contains copper cables before extracting.\n\n### Errors due to Missing Resources\n- Always ensure the required resources are available before starting production. The Assembling Machine at Position (x=10.5, y=0.5) requires copper plates for copper cable production.\n\n### Errors when Refueling\n- Regularly check fuel levels in boilers and other fuel-dependent entities to prevent interruptions in production."}
