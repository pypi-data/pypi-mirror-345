{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=4.0, y=-60.0) with a drop position at (x=4.5, y=-58.5)\n- **Wooden Chests** for storage at positions:\n  - (x=5.5, y=-60.5) containing iron plates\n  - (x=4.5, y=-58.5) currently empty\n  - Additional chests at positions (x=7.5, y=-60.5), (x=6.5, y=-60.5), (x=9.5, y=-60.5), (x=8.5, y=-60.5), each containing iron plates\n\n### Iron Smelting Area\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnaces** for smelting iron ore into iron plates at positions:\n  - (x=-15.0, y=-48.0) with coal fuel and iron ore in source\n  - (x=-13.0, y=-48.0) with coal fuel and iron ore in source\n  - (x=-11.0, y=-48.0) with coal fuel and iron ore in source\n- **Wooden Chests** for storing outputs at positions:\n  - (x=-14.5, y=-50.5) to (x=-9.5, y=-50.5) with various contents including iron plates and iron ore\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items into furnaces without available inventory\n- Ensure that the required items are present in your inventory before attempting to insert them into a furnace. Check inventory levels to avoid this error.\n\n### Errors due to burner mining drill running out of fuel\n- Regularly check and refuel burner mining drills to prevent them from stopping due to lack of fuel. This ensures continuous operation and resource extraction.\n\n### Errors due to full chests blocking mining operations\n- Monitor and empty chests at drop positions to prevent mining drills from halting operations due to full storage. This will maintain efficient resource collection.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- **insert_item**: Attempts to insert a specified quantity of an item into a target entity. Ensure that the source inventory has the required items to avoid insertion errors.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `furnace`: Represents a stone furnace entity used for smelting operations.\n- `burner_mining_drill`: Represents a burner mining drill entity used for resource extraction.\n- `chest`: Represents storage entities used to hold various items like iron plates and iron ore."}
