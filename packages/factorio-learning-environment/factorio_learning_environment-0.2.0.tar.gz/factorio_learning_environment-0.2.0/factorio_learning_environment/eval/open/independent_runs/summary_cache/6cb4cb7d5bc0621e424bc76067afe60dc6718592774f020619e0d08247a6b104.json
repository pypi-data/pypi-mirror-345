{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-15.0, y=-49.0)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Fuel: Coal (5 units)\n  - Source: Iron Ore (2 units)\n  - Result: Iron Plate (42 units)\n\n### Coal Mining Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=42.0, y=-83.0)\n  - Fueled with Wood (2 units)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Warnings: Output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Drop Position: (x=42.5, y=-81.5)\n  - Resources: Coal (39997 units)\n\n### Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=0.5, y=0.5)\n  - Status: Normal\n  - Inventory: Empty\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure there is a buildable area before attempting to place entities. Adjust the BuildingBox size or use multiple smaller BuildingBoxes if necessary.\n- Verify that the target tile is unoccupied before placing an entity. Avoid placing entities where another entity already exists.\n\n### Errors with blocked outputs\n- Ensure there is a sink entity in place to accept the output from drills and other production entities to prevent blockage.\n\n### Errors with inventory management\n- Ensure the required items are available in the inventory before attempting to insert them into entities. For example, ensure coal is available before attempting to add it to a furnace.\n\n### Errors with chest placement\n- Verify the placement position for chests is valid and not obstructed by other entities or terrain features."}
