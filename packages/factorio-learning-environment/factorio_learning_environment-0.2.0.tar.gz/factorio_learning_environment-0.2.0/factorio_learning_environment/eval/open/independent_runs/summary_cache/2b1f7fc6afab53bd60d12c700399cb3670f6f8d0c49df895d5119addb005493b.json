{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll generate a comprehensive report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining Setup (around x=41, y=-84)\n- Burner mining drill at (41.0, -85.0) mining coal\n- Burner inserter at (41.5, -83.5) transferring coal\n- Wooden chest at (42.5, -83.5) collecting coal\nSystem is operational with drill working and inserter waiting for items\n\n### Iron Production Setup 1 (around x=-19, y=-53)\n- Burner mining drill at (-20.0, -54.0) mining iron ore\n- Stone furnace at (-19.0, -52.0) smelting iron plates\nSystem is operational with both entities working\n\n### Iron Production Setup 2 (around x=-13, y=-55)\n- Burner mining drill at (-14.0, -56.0) mining iron ore\n- Stone furnace at (-13.0, -54.0) smelting iron plates\nSystem is operational with both entities working\n\nERROR TIPS\n1. Output Blocking Issues\n- Mining drills are showing warnings about output being blocked by items on ground\n- Ensure proper item collection system (inserters/belts) is in place to prevent output blocking\n\n2. Entity Placement Coordination\n- Multiple attempts at placing coal inserter with different orientations suggest coordination issues\n- Plan the final orientation before placing inserters to avoid multiple rotations\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nImportant Variables:\n- None explicitly defined in logs\n\nFunctions:\n- None explicitly defined in logs\n\nEntity States:\n- Coal drill: WORKING\n- Coal inserter: WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS\n- Iron drills: WORKING\n- Furnaces: WORKING\n\nThe systems appear to be functional but could benefit from improved item transport infrastructure to prevent output blocking."}
