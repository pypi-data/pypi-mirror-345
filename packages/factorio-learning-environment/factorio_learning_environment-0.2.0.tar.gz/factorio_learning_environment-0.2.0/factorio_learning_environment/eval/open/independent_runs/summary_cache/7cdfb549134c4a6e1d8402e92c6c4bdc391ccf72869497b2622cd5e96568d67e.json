{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-46.5, -123.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-46.5, -123.5)\n- Steam Engine at Position (-40.5, -113.5)\n- Multiple Small Electric Poles around the steam engine for connection\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-15.0, -76.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at Position (-15.5, -77.5)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-19.0, -73.0) with a source of copper ore and producing iron plates\n\n### Iron Plate Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0) with coal as fuel, producing iron plates\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) connected to the power network, transferring items from the furnace to a Wooden Chest at Position (6.5, -59.5)\n\n### Pipe Network\nConsists of multiple PipeGroups at various positions, such as:\n- PipeGroup at Position (-35.5, -122.5)\n- PipeGroup at Position (-48.5, -112.5)\n- PipeGroup at Position (-0.5, 10.5)\n- PipeGroup at Position (-5.5, 24.5)\n\n### Power Network\nConsists of:\n- Electricity Group with Small Electric Poles at various positions, such as (7.5, -60.5) and (9.5, -61.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors When Reconnecting Pipes\n- Ensure there are no placement blockages before attempting to reconnect pipes. Verify that the path is clear and the pipes can be connected without obstruction.\n\n### Insufficient Resources for Crafting\n- Maintain adequate inventory levels of required materials, such as copper cables, to avoid crafting failures. Regularly check inventory and replenish resources as needed.\n\n### Inserter Not Receiving Power\n- Ensure that inserters are correctly connected to the power network. Verify the connection of small electric poles and ensure they are within range to supply power to the inserter.\n\n### Furnace Lacking Ingredients\n- Regularly supply furnaces with the necessary ingredients to maintain continuous production. Monitor furnace inventories and ensure they are stocked with the required materials for smelting."}
