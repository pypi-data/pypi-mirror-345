{"content": "# FACTORIO AGENT REPORT\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Smelting Station at Position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of a stone furnace that was set up to smelt iron ore into iron plates. The agent placed the furnace and inserted coal and iron ore into it to produce iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when trying to craft items that require raw resources\n- Make sure to gather all necessary raw resources (like stone) before attempting to craft items that require them\n- Stone is a raw resource that must be gathered, not crafted\n\n### Errors when trying to craft items that require furnace smelting\n- Items like iron-plate cannot be directly crafted; they require smelting iron ore in a furnace\n- Set up furnaces to produce the necessary intermediate materials before attempting to craft items that require them\n\n### Errors when trying to craft multiple items at once\n- When crafting items that require intermediate materials that need to be smelted (like iron-gear-wheels requiring iron plates), craft them one at a time\n- Ensure you have enough materials for each individual crafting operation\n- The agent successfully crafted iron gear wheels one at a time but failed when trying to craft multiple at once"}
