{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-3.5, 26.0)\nConsists of:\n- Boiler at position (-3.5, 26.0)\n- Offshore pump at position (-11.5, 26.5) (Note: Connection issues with boiler)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Multiple stone furnaces at positions (0.0, 0.0), (10.0, 0.0), (13.0, 0.0), and (16.0, 0.0)\n- Chests at positions (8.5, -0.5), (17.5, -0.5), (19.5, -0.5), and (20.5, -0.5)\n- Burner inserters at positions (8.5, 0.5), (17.5, 0.5), (19.5, 0.5), and (20.5, 0.5) connecting chests to furnaces\n\n### Pipe Networks\nConsists of multiple pipe groups:\n- PipeGroup at position (17.5, 3.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (-0.5, 11.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (5.5, 18.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (-8.5, 21.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (18.5, 21.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (22.5, 20.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (-8.5, 23.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (-0.5, 22.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (14.5, 22.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (16.5, 23.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (7.5, 24.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (-2.5, 27.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (5.5, 27.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (34.5, 27.5)\n\n### Electricity Network\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at various positions including (3.5, 20.5), (14.5, 20.5), (10.5, 13.5), and more, with a voltage of 0\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Pipe Connections\n- Ensure that pipes and underground pipes are correctly placed and connected between the offshore pump and the boiler. Check for any obstructions or incorrect placements that might prevent connection.\n\n### Errors with Entity Pickup\n- When using the `pickup_entity` function, ensure that if the first argument is an Entity object, the second argument must be None. If a position is required, ensure it is a valid Position object.\n\n### Errors with Placing Entities\n- Before placing pipes or any other entities, ensure the target tile is clear of obstructions. If an obstruction is present, clear it before attempting to place the entity.\n\n### Boiler Refueling and Verification\n- Verify the presence of the boiler at the specified position before attempting to refuel or connect it. Ensure the boiler is correctly placed and accessible."}
