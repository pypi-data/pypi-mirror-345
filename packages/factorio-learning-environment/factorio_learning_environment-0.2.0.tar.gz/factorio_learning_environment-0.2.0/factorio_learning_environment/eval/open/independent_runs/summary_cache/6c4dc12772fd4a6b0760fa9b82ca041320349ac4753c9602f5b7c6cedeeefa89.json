There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Neighbours: Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0)\n  - Drop Position: (-16.5, -52.5)\n  - Resources: 40,000 units of iron ore\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-14.0, -49.0)\n  - Fuel: 14 units of coal\n  - Status: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Furnace Result: 60 units of iron plate\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied or invalid locations\n- Ensure the desired location is free of other entities or obstructions before attempting to place an entity. This includes checking for existing structures or terrain that may block placement.\n\n### Errors when moving entities to a new location\n- Verify that the destination position is valid and unoccupied before attempting to move an entity there. This will prevent errors related to invalid or occupied positions.\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities from specific positions\n- Confirm the presence of the entity at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it. This can be done by checking the map or using a function to verify the entity's existence at the location.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into entities\n- Ensure that the items to be inserted are available in your inventory. Attempting to insert items not present in the inventory will result in an error.\n\n### Errors due to lack of sink entities for outputs\n- Make sure there is a connected sink entity, such as a chest or belt, to receive the output from production entities like drills or furnaces. This will prevent output blockage warnings and ensure continuous operation."}
