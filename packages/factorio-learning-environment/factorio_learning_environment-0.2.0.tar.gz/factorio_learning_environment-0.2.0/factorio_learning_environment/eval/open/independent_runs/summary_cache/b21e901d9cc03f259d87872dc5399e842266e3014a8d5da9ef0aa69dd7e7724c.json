{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Fuel: Coal (4 units)\n  - Neighbours: Wooden Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Contains: Iron Ore (455 units)\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Fuel: Coal (4 units)\n  - Pickup Position: (x=-12.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Drop Position: (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Status: Waiting for Source Items\n  - Neighbours: Wooden Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (9 units)\n  - Status: No Ingredients\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Inserter Setup\n- Ensure the inserter is correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items from the chest to the furnace. The current setup indicates the furnace is not receiving iron ore. Double-check the inserter's pickup and drop positions.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Inventory Items\n- Before attempting to insert items such as coal into entities, verify that your inventory contains the necessary items. The error \"Could not insert: No coal to insert from your inventory\" suggests a need to manage inventory levels effectively.\n\n### Errors in Furnace Operation\n- The furnace is not receiving the required ingredients for smelting. Ensure that the inserter is functioning correctly and that the iron ore is being transferred from the chest to the furnace."}
