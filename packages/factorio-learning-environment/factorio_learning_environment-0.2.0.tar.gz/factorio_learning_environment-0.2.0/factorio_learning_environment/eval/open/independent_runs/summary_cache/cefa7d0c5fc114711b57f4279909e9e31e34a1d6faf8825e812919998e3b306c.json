{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Fuel: Coal (3 units)\n  - Warnings: Output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Resources: Iron Ore (40,000 units)\n  - Drop Position: (x=-16.5, y=-52.5)\n  - Neighbours: Stone Furnace at Position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)\n  - Status: No Ingredients\n  - Fuel: Coal (14 units)\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Furnace Result: Iron Plate (60 units)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied positions\n- Ensure the target position for placing an entity is clear of other entities or items. This includes checking the drill's drop position before attempting to place a Wooden Chest, Stone Furnace, or Burner Inserter.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities from specific positions\n- Verify that the entity type you are trying to retrieve exists at the specified position. For example, ensure that a Stone Furnace is present at the intended coordinates before attempting to interact with it.\n\n### Errors when placing Transport Belts\n- Confirm that the desired location for placing Transport Belts is valid and unoccupied by other entities."}
