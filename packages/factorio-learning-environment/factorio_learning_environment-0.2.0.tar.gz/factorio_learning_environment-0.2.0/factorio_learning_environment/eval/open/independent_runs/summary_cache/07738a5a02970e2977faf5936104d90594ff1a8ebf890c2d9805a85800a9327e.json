Ensure that all prerequisites are met before attempting to craft it. This requires the automation technology to be researched first.\n- If the recipe remains disabled, investigate the technology requirements and ensure they are fulfilled.\n\n### Errors when attempting to craft items without unlocked recipes\n- Ensure that the required technology is researched before attempting to craft items. In this case, the automation technology must be confirmed as researched to unlock the recipe for Assembling Machine 1.\n\n### Errors when checking technology progress\n- The error indicates that the technology \"energy-shields\" does not exist. Verify the list of available technologies before checking their progress to avoid referencing non-existent technologies.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `get_research_progress(tech)`: This function checks the progress of a specific technology. It failed when checking for \"energy-shields\" which does not exist.\n- `craft_item(item, quantity)`: This function attempts to craft a specified quantity of an item. It failed to craft Assembling Machine 1 due to the recipe being locked.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `inventory`: dict - Represents the current inventory of the agent.\n- `entities`: list - Contains the entities present on the map after the current step.\n- `crafted_quantity_assembler`: int - Represents the quantity of Assembling Machine 1 attempted to craft."}
