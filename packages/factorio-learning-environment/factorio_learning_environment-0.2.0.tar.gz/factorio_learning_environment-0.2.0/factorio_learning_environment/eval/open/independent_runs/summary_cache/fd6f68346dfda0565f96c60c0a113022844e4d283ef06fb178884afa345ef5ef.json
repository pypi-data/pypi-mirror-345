{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at Position (-15.0, -50.0) extracting iron ore, fueled with coal.\n- **Wooden Chests** at Positions (-14.5, -48.5) and (-15.5, -48.5) for temporary storage.\n- **Burner Inserter** at Position (-13.5, -48.5) transferring items from the mining drill to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at Position (-12.0, -48.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates, fueled with coal.\n- **Burner Inserter** at Position (-14.5, -47.5) transferring items between chests and the furnace.\n- **Wooden Chest** at Position (-14.5, -46.5) storing iron ore and iron plates.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Wooden Chests** at Positions (-7.5, -48.5), (-6.5, -48.5), (-6.5, -49.5), (-5.5, -48.5), (-4.5, -48.5), and (-3.5, -48.5) storing iron plates.\n\n### Auxiliary Processing and Storage\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at Position (-10.0, -48.0) with no ingredients to smelt, indicating a need for resource input.\n- **Burner Inserters** at Positions (-11.5, -46.5), (-11.5, -45.5), and (-8.5, -47.5) waiting for source items.\n- **Wooden Chests** at Positions (-6.5, -47.5) and (-7.5, -47.5) currently empty.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Extracting Items from Furnaces\n- Ensure the furnace has the required items before attempting extraction. Verify the quantity and type of items available in the furnace before executing extraction commands.\n\n### Inserter Blockage Issues\n- Check for blockages at inserter drop positions. Ensure that the destination has enough space to accommodate the items being transferred.\n\n### Errors when Inserters are Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entity has items available for the inserter to pick up. Regularly check and replenish resources in the source entity to prevent inserters from idling.\n\n### Errors when Furnaces Have No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Regularly supply furnaces with the necessary raw materials to maintain continuous operation. Monitor inventory levels and automate resource delivery to prevent downtime."}
