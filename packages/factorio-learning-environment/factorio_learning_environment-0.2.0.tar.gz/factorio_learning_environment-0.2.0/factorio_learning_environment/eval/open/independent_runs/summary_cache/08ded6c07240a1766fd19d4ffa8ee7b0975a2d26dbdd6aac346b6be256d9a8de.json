{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (40.0, y=-84.0) extracting resources, with its output directed towards a Wooden Chest at position (41.5, y=-83.5).\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-15.0, y=-49.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=54.5, y=-83.5) transferring items from a Wooden Chest at position (x=56.5, y=-83.5).\n- BeltGroup connecting various positions, facilitating the movement of coal and other materials.\n\n### Coal Transport System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- BeltGroup with inputs and outputs at various positions, moving coal along the path from (x=50.5, y=-86.5) to (x=47.5, y=-86.5), and from (x=43.5, y=-84.5) to (x=47.5, y=-85.5).\n- The system is operational, ensuring a steady supply of coal to the necessary structures.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when mining drill output is blocked\n- Regularly check and clear any items on the ground that may block the output of mining drills. Ensure there is a sink entity, such as a chest, to accept the output.\n\n### Errors when using inserters without a source\n- Ensure that inserters have a valid source of items to transfer. Verify that the source entity, such as a chest or belt, is correctly positioned and contains items for the inserter to move.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
