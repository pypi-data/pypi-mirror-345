Ensure that the connections to the steam engine are not obstructed.\n\n### Errors when Placing Steam Engines and Boilers\n- Avoid placing steam engines and boilers where the footprint overlaps with water or existing entities. Clear the area before attempting placement.\n\n### Errors when Picking Up Entities\n- Ensure the entity you are attempting to pick up exists at the specified position. Verify the position before attempting to pick up the entity.\n\n### Errors with Lab Power\n- Ensure that the lab is connected to a power source and that the power source is operational. Check the connections and the power network for any issues.\n\n### Errors with Pipe Connections\n- Ensure that you have the necessary pipes in your inventory before attempting to connect entities. Verify the connection path and ensure it is clear of obstructions.\n\n### Errors due to Lack of Power\n- Ensure that the lab and other entities requiring power are connected to a functioning power network. Verify that the electricity generator is operational and supplying power.\n\n### Errors when Connecting Entities\n- Ensure that the connection points between entities like boilers and steam engines are not blocked. Reposition entities if necessary to unblock connection points.\n\n### Errors when Removing and Repositioning Steam Engines\n- Before attempting to reposition a steam engine, ensure there is no existing entity at the target location. Clear the area to avoid placement conflicts.\n\n### Repeated Errors in Steam Engine Placement\n- Repeated attempts to place steam engines at positions where existing objects block placement indicate a need for better planning of layout"}
