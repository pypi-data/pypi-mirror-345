{"content": "\"\"\"\nThe most recent actions have resulted in a couple of errors, indicating that the furnace is still not functioning as expected:\n\n### Errors Encountered:\n1. **Extraction Error**:\n   - The active furnace inventory status after attempting to extract stone shows that it is empty (`{}`), which suggests that the extraction did not occur as intended.\n   \n2. **Insertion Error**:\n   - When trying to insert **1 piece of Copper Ore**, an error occurred stating: **\"Cannot insert copper-ore - furnace already contains stone.\"** This indicates that the furnace is still holding onto the stone, preventing any new materials from being added.\n\n### Observations:\n- The furnace is not recognizing the extraction correctly, and it seems to be stuck in a state where it cannot process or accept new items.\n- The furnace still has **1 piece of stone** that is preventing it from accepting the Copper Ore.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Force Clear the Furnace**: I will attempt to forcefully clear the furnace of any remaining items, including the stone.\n2. **Reload Stone**: After clearing, I will load **5 pieces of stone** into the furnace again.\n3. **Insert Copper Ore for Processing**: Finally, I will add **1 piece of Copper Ore** into the furnace to initiate the smelting operation.\n4. **Monitor the Smelting Operation**: I will check if the furnace begins processing the Copper Ore successfully.\n\nLet's proceed to force clear the furnace of any remaining items. \n\"\"\"\n\n# Force clear the active furnace of any remaining items\nclear_furnace(furnace_status)  # Attempt to clear the furnace of all contents\n\n# Check the inventory status of the furnace after clearing\nactive_furnace_status_after_clear = inspect_inventory(furnace_status)  # Inspect the status after clearing\noverall_inventory_after_clear = inspect_inventory()  # Check total inventory after clearing.\n\nprint(f\"Active Furnace inventory status after clearing: {active_furnace_status_after_clear}\")  # Status of the furnace after clearing.\nprint(f\"Overall current inventory after clearing: {overall_inventory_after_clear}\")  # Total after operations.\n\n# Now, I will attempt to insert the required 5 pieces of stone again\ninsert_item(Prototype.Stone, furnace_status, quantity=5)  # Insert 5 pieces of stone into the active furnace\n\n# After inserting the stone, also insert the copper ore\ninsert_item(Prototype.CopperOre, furnace_status, quantity=1)  # Insert copper ore for processing\n\n# Check overall furnace inventory and player inventory again to see if they were updated accordingly\nactive_furnace_inventory_status_after_insertion = inspect_inventory(furnace_status)  # Check the furnace status after insertion attempt\noverall_inventory_after_insertion = inspect_inventory()  # Check total inventory after inserting stone and copper ore.\n\nprint(f\"Active Furnace inventory status after insertion attempt: {active_furnace_inventory_status_after_insertion}\")  # Output current furnace status after attempt\nprint(f\"Overall current inventory after insertion attempt: {overall_inventory_after_insertion}\")  # Output total inventory after attempt \nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")  # Review entities available on the map.", "summary_range": "[1-440]"}
