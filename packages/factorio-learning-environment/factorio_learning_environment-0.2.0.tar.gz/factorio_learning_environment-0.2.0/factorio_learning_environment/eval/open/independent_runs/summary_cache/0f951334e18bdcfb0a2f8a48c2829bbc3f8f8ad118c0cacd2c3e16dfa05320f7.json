This will prevent errors related to \"No coal to insert from your inventory.\"\n\n### Warnings about Full Chests\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are used as drop positions for mining drills to avoid interruptions in mining operations. The warning \"chest at drop position is full\" indicates that mining will halt until the chest is emptied.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that source items are available for inserters to pick up. The warning \"inserter waiting for source items\" suggests that the inserter cannot perform its function due to a lack of items at its pickup position.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n- **coal_drill**: Represents a burner mining drill entity that is intended to be refueled with coal.\n- **iron_ore**: Represents the iron ore resource being mined and processed.\n- **iron_plate**: Represents the processed product from iron ore in the stone furnace.\n\nNo utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided steps."}
