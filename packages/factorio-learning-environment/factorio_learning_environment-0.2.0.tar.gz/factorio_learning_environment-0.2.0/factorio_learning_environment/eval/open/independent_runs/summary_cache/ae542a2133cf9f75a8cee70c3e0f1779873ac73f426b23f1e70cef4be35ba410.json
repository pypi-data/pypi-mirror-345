Avoid using unexpected keyword arguments (e.g. \u201cradius\u201d) or supplying extra positional arguments.\n  - Validate the return value before iterating over it to prevent errors with NoneType objects.\n\n\u2022 Lab Placement and Crafting:\n  - Prior to attempting to place a Lab, verify that a Lab exists in the inventory.\n  - For Lab crafting, double-check that all required sub-ingredients (such as iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, and copper-cables) are available. Strengthen your resource processing (including smelting) to meet these prerequisites.\n\n\u2022 Resource Dependency Management:\n  - Ensure that cascading resource requirements are satisfied before initiating complex crafting recipes. Missing intermediate items (e.g. insufficient iron-plates or copper-plates to produce sub-ingredients) can lead to repeated crafting failures."}
