For example, multiple attempts to insert iron ore into the new stone furnace failed due to insufficient iron ore in the inventory.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items. This was observed with the extraction attempts from the furnaces.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it. This was not explicitly logged but is a common issue when managing multiple structures."}
