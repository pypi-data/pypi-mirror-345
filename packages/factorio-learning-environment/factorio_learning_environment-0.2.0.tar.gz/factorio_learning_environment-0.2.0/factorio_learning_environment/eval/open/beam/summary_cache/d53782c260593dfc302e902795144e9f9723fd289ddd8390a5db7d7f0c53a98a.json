{"content": "Let me analyze what's happening:\n\n1. The drill is working but waiting for space in destination\n2. The inserter is placed but waiting for space in destination\n3. The furnace is placed but showing NO_FUEL despite us adding fuel\n\nKey issues:\n1. The furnace is too far from the inserter's reach\n2. The inserter's drop position isn't aligned with the furnace's input\n3. Multiple inserters are being placed in incorrect positions\n\nLet's try a more precise approach:\n\n```python\n# First move to the drill's position\nmove_to(Position(19.0, -17.0))\nprint(\"Moved to drill position\")\n\n# Get our drill reference\ndrill = get_entities({Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill})[0]\nprint(f\"Working with drill at {drill.position}\")\n\n# Calculate exact positions\ninserter_pos = Position(\n    x=drill.drop_position.x,\n    y=drill.drop_position.y\n)\n\nfurnace_pos = Position(\n    x=drill.drop_position.x + 1.5,  # Place furnace closer\n    y=drill.drop_position.y\n)\n\n# Place furnace first (it's bigger)\nfurnace = place_entity(\n    Prototype.StoneFurnace,\n    position=furnace_pos\n)\nprint(f\"Placed furnace at {furnace.position}\")\n\n# Place inserter at drill's drop position\ninserter = place_entity(\n    Prototype.BurnerInserter,\n    position=inserter_pos\n)\nrotate_entity(inserter, Direction.RIGHT)\nprint(f\"Placed inserter at {inserter.position}\")\n\n# Add fuel to all machines\ninsert_item(Prototype.Coal, drill, quantity=5)\ninsert_item(Prototype.Coal, inserter, quantity=1)\ninsert_item(Prototype.Coal, furnace, quantity=5)\nprint(\"Added fuel to all machines\")\n\n# Let system work\nprint(\"Waiting for system to process ore...\")\nsleep(10)\n\n# Check final status\nprint(f\"Final status:\")\nprint(f\"Drill status: {drill.status}\")\nprint(f\"Inserter status: {inserter.status}\")\nprint(f\"Furnace status: {furnace.status}\")\nprint(f\"Furnace inventory: {inspect_inventory(furnace)}\")\n```\n\nThis new approach:\n1. Uses exact coordinates from the drill's drop position\n2. Places the furnace closer to the inserter\n3. Ensures proper alignment between all components\n4. Places the furnace first since it's larger and needs more space\n\nThe key learning points are:\n1. Entity positions need to be precisely aligned\n2. Larger entities (furnace) should be placed first\n3. The inserter needs to be exactly at the drill's drop position\n4. The furnace needs to be within the inserter's reach\n5. All machines need fuel to operate", "summary_range": "[1-3360]"}
