{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Crude Oil Extraction, Refining and Power Generation Structure at position (17.5, 40.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- PumpJack (position: 17.5, 40.5) extracting crude oil\n- StorageTank (position: 12.5, 40.5) storing crude oil\n- Boiler (position: 22.5, 41.0) generating steam\n- SteamEngine (position: 26.5, 41.5) generating power\n- OilRefinery (position: 17.5, 45.5) processing crude oil\n- OilRefinery (position: 12.5, 46.5) processing crude oil\n- Pipe (position: 15.5, 40.5) connecting PumpJack to StorageTank\n- Pipe (position: 14.5, 40.5) connecting PumpJack to StorageTank\n- PipeGroup connecting PumpJack to StorageTank (positions: 11.5, 38.5 to 18.5, 38.5 and additional pipes at 14.5, 40.5; 15.5, 40.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting Boiler to SteamEngine (positions: 22.5, 39.5 to 29.5, 39.5 and 29.5, 41.5)\n- ElectricityGroup connecting SteamEngine to PumpJack (poles at positions: 26.5, 43.5; 20.5, 41.5; 22.5, 43.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n* Errors when accessing non-existent attributes of entities:\n  - The 'StorageTank' object has no attribute 'contents'. Use the correct attribute or method to access the fluid level or contents.\n  - The 'StorageTank' object has no attribute 'fluidbox'. Check the correct attribute or method to access the fluid level or contents.\n* Errors when inspecting inventory of entities:\n  - Could not inspect inventory of name='storage-tank'. Check if the entity is valid and if the inventory can be inspected.\n* Errors when placing entities:\n  - Could not place oil-refinery at (17.5, 40.5) because there is an existing object in the way. Ensure the target location is clear before placing an entity.\n  - Could not place pipe at (13.5, 40.5) because there is an existing object in the way. Ensure the target location is clear before placing an entity.\n* Errors when connecting entities:\n  - Did not find any valid connections between source Prototype.PumpJack at x=17.5 y=40.5 and target Prototype.StorageTank at x=12.5 y=40.5. Make sure none of the source or target connections points are blocked and the target is able to receive the fluid from the source.\n  - The source does not have fluid in it. Cannot connect an empty source to a Prototype.OilRefinery. The Prototype.OilRefinery input handlers are fluid specific so source entity needs to have fluid in it.\n* Tips:\n  - Ensure that the entity has the attribute or method you are trying to access.\n  - Check the entity's type and its available attributes and methods.\n  - Ensure the target location is clear before placing an entity.\n  - Check that the source entity has fluid before connecting it to another entity that requires fluid.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\nNo utility functions have been defined by the agent.\n\n Important variables that have been assigned:\n- storage_tank (type: StorageTank)\n- pumpjack (type: PumpJack)\n- boiler (type: Boiler)\n- steam_engine (type: SteamEngine)\n- oil_refinery (type: OilRefinery)"}
