{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Oil Processing Facility\n- **Pumpjack** at position (17.5, 40.5) - Extracts crude oil\n- **Oil Refinery** at position (24.5, 44.5) - Processes crude oil into petroleum gas (recipe: basic oil processing)\n- **Chemical Plant** at position (31.5, 46.5) - Produces plastic bars (recipe: plastic bar)\n- Connected with pipe networks:\n  - Water pipes from offshore pump to boiler\n  - Oil pipes from pumpjack to refinery\n  - Petroleum gas pipes from refinery to chemical plant\n\n### Coal Mining Operation\n- **Electric Mining Drill** at position (34.5, 20.5) - Mines coal\n- Connected to transport belts leading towards chemical plant (but not yet connected due to missing inserter)\n\n### Power Generation Facility\n- **Offshore Pump** at position (-9.5, -0.5) - Supplies water\n- **Boiler** at position (-7.0, -0.5) - Heats water (currently out of fuel)\n- **Steam Engine** at position (-2.5, -0.5) - Generates electricity (currently not connected to power network)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Prototype Name Errors\n- Use correct prototype names (e.g., `PumpJack` instead of `Pumpjack`)\n\n### Entity Placement Errors\n- Move within 10 tiles of target position before placing entities\n- Ensure target position is clear before placing entities (especially inserters)\n- Transport belts cannot connect directly to chemical plants - use inserters as intermediaries\n\n### Power System Issues\n- Connect steam engine to power network with electric poles\n- Fuel the boiler to enable power generation\n- Connect all electrical devices (mining drills, pumpjacks, chemical plants) to power network\n\n### Fluid System Issues\n- Ensure all fluid connections are properly made (currently some pipes show as empty)\n- Verify refinery and chemical plant have correct input/output connections\n\n### Common Patterns\n- Repeated attempts to place inserters at occupied positions (30.5, 46.5)\n- Multiple placement attempts while too far from target location\n- Referencing undefined variables (e.g., 'steam_engine' before definition)"}
