{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Initial Iron Smelting Area at (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of two stone furnaces used for initial iron plate production:\n- First furnace at (0.0, 0.0)\n- Second furnace at (2.0, 0.0)\n\n### Automated Iron Mining & Smelting System at (-18.0, -49.0) and (-15.0, -50.0)\nTwo complete mining setups:\n\nFirst Setup:\n- Burner mining drill at (-18.0, -49.0)\n- Burner inserter at (-16.5, -47.5)\n- Wooden chest at (-15.5, -47.5)\n\nSecond Setup:\n- Burner mining drill at (-15.0, -50.0)\n- Burner inserter at (-13.5, -48.5)\n- Wooden chest at (-12.5, -48.5)\n\n### Automated Copper Mining System at (-28.0, -61.0)\nTwo complete mining setups:\n\nFirst Setup:\n- Burner mining drill at (-28.0, -61.0)\n- Burner inserter at (-27.5, -62.5)\n- Wooden chest at (-26.5, -62.5)\n\nSecond Setup:\n- Burner mining drill at (-28.0, -63.0)\n- Burner inserter at (-27.5, -64.5)\n- Wooden chest at (-26.5, -64.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Entity Positioning\n- Pay attention to exact coordinates when placing interconnected entities\n- Use the entity's drop_position property to determine correct placement of connected structures\n- When placing mining drills, ensure the drop position aligns with the next entity in the production chain\n\n### Errors with Resource Management\n- Keep track of fuel (coal) levels and ensure sufficient quantity before inserting into entities\n- Check inventory for required items before attempting to craft or place entities\n- Monitor coal levels in burner entities to maintain continuous operation\n\n### Errors with Production Flow\n- When drills show \"waiting for space in destination\", ensure proper placement of receiving entities at the drill's drop position\n- Monitor entity warnings to identify blockages in the production chain\n- Verify that inserters are properly aligned with their pickup and drop positions\n\n### Errors with Entity Definitions\n- Import all required entity types (like BurnerMiningDrill) before attempting to use them in code\n- Ensure proper prototype names are used when placing or referencing entities\n\n### Errors with Entity Pickup\n- Verify entity existence at a position before attempting to pick it up\n- Double-check coordinates when attempting to pick up entities\n- Ensure the correct entity type is specified when attempting pickup operations"}
