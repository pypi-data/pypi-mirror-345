{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nNo structures have been successfully created on the map. The execution logs indicate repeated attempts to place entities such as Burner Mining Drills and Stone Furnaces, but none have been placed due to errors.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when finding buildable spots\n- Ensure that the area you are trying to build on is clear of obstacles and has enough space for the entity's BuildingBox. Consider using smaller BuildingBoxes or multiple smaller ones if the area is constrained.\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure the target location is valid and unoccupied before attempting to place entities like Burner Mining Drills and Stone Furnaces. Confirm that the placement logic accounts for terrain and other existing structures.\n\n### Errors with undefined variables\n- Double-check that all variables are properly defined before use. Specifically, ensure that the 'furnace' variable is correctly initialized and available in the context where it is being referenced.\n\n### Errors with movement commands\n- When using move commands, ensure that the indices used are integers, not strings. Verify that the positions are correctly formatted and accessible.\n\n### General placement errors\n- Re-evaluate the approach to entity placement, ensuring that the logic accounts for all possible placement scenarios and that the entities are being placed in a logical and efficient manner."}
