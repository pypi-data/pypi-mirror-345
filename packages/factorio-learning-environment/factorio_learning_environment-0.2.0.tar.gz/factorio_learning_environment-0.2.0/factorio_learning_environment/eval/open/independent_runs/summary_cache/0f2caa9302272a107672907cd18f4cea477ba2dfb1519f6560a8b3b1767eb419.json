The agent retrieved and utilized this furnace during resource processing operations.\n\n### Copper Smelting Furnace at Position (\u201327.0, \u201360.0)\nDeployed for processing copper ore and coal into copper plates, this furnace was similarly engaged to resolve a resource shortage for lab crafting components.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 API Argument Errors \u2013 Ensure that retrieval calls like get_entities match the function\u2019s signature. Remove unexpected keyword arguments (e.g., \u201cradius\u201d) and adjust positional arguments as required.\n\n\u2022 None Handling in Entity Retrieval \u2013 Before iterating over results, verify that a valid list is returned; use an empty list as a fallback if the function returns None.\n\n\u2022 Crafting Prerequisite Shortages \u2013 Prior to lab crafting, confirm the complete availability of all required sub-ingredients (such as iron-plate, iron-gear-wheel, copper-plate, copper-cable, and electronic-circuit) and ensure that preceding production processes (like furnace smelting) are properly established.\n\n\u2022 Lab Placement Reliability \u2013 Validate that inventory holds the necessary Lab item and that resource chains are fully satisfied before attempting placement, to avoid repeated failures."}
