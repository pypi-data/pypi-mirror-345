Ensure that all pipeline components use the updated and consistent fluid_system identifier (currently 85203) when attempting connections.\n- Search Radius Verification:\n  - Confirm that the search radius for detecting candidate pipe groups is sufficiently broad to capture nearby valid entities.\n- Inventory Attribute Consistency:\n  - Use supported inventory parameters when querying or modifying inventory items to prevent attribute-related errors."}
