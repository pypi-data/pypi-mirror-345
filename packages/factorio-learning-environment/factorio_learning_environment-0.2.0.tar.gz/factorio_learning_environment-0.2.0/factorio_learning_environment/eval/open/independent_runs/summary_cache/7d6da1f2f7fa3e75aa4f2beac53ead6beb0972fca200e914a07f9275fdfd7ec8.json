{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-23.0, -66.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-25.0, -64.0) connected via transport belts to a Stone Furnace.\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-23.0, -66.0) fueled by coal, currently processing iron ore into iron plates.\n- Transport Belt Group connecting the mining drill to the furnace for efficient ore transfer.\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (53.0, -83.0) extracting coal.\n- Wooden Chest at Position (52.5, -84.5) storing extracted coal.\n- The mining drill is directly connected to the chest for automatic coal transfer.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage Facility at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-14.0, -53.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at Position (-14.5, -54.5) storing extracted iron ore.\n- The mining drill is directly connected to the chest for automatic iron ore transfer.\n\n### Inactive Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0) with no ingredients to smelt, currently inactive.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Assertion Errors in Iron Ore Management\n- Ensure that the furnace has at least 10 iron ore before attempting to process. This can be achieved by checking the ore count before inserting it into the furnace.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
