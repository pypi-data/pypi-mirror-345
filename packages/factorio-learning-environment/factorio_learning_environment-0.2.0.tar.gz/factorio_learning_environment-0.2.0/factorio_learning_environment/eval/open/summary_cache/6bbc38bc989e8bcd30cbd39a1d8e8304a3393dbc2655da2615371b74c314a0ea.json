{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron plate production structure at position around (16.0, 71.0)\nConsists of the following connected entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (16.0, 71.0) extracting iron ore\n- Burner inserter at position (17.5, 71.5) transferring ore from drill to furnace\n- Stone furnace at position (17.0, 73.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates\n- Burner inserter at position (14.5, 73.5) extracting iron plates from furnace onto transport belts\n- Transport belts connecting furnace output inserter at (13.5, 73.5) to assembling machine input inserter at (24.5, 73.5)\n- Small electric pole at (14.5, 72.5) providing power to inserters near furnace\n\n### Iron gear wheel assembly structure at position around (21.5, 73.5)\nConsists of the following connected entities:\n- Assembling machine 2 at position (21.5, 73.5) set to craft iron gear wheels\n- Burner inserter at position (23.5, 73.5) feeding iron plates into assembler\n- Burner inserter at position (19.5, 73.5) taking iron gear wheels from assembler\n- Wooden chest at position (18.5, 73.5) collecting iron gear wheels\n- Small electric pole at position (21.5, 75.5) providing power to assembler and inserters\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors placing entities due to inventory or position conflicts\n- Attempted to place assembling-machine-1 without having it in inventory; ensure the required entity is available before placement.\n- Could not place burner inserter next to furnace due to existing wooden chest or burner inserter occupying the target tile; increase spacing, change direction, or adjust reference position to find free space.\n- Could not place small electric pole at intended position because of existing objects; verify tile availability before placement.\n\n### Errors connecting transport belts directly from furnaces\n- Transport belts cannot be connected directly from a furnace entity. Use an inserter to extract items from the furnace and connect belts from the inserter instead.\n\n### Power supply issues to assembling machine\n- Assembling machine 2 is not receiving power despite connected electric poles; verify that electric poles form a continuous power network and that the assembler is within pole coverage.\n- Repeated assembler status shows no power and zero energy; ensure power poles are correctly placed and connected without obstructions.\n\n### General tips to avoid placement and power errors\n- Before placing entities, check for existing entities on target tiles to avoid placement conflicts.\n- When connecting belts or inserters, ensure the source entity is valid for the connection type.\n- Confirm power pole placement covers all electric entities and that poles are interconnected to form a power grid.\n\n"}
