{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0): Extracts iron ore and deposits it into a chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5): Stores extracted iron ore, currently containing 494 units.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates but is currently not receiving iron ore due to inserter setup issues.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Setup Issues\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items from the chest to the furnace. Repeated repositioning indicates a persistent alignment issue.\n\n### Fuel Management Errors\n- Ensure you have sufficient coal in your inventory before attempting to refuel entities. An error occurred when trying to insert coal into an inserter without having coal available in the inventory.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Ingredients\n- Check the inserter setup to ensure it is correctly configured to transfer iron ore from the chest to the furnace. The furnace is not receiving iron ore, which prevents it from smelting.\n\nBy addressing these errors, the efficiency of the iron ore processing facility can be significantly improved."}
