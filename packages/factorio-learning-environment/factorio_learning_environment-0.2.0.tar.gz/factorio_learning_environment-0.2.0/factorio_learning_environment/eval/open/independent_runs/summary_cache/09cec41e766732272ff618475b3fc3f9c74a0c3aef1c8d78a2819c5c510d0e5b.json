{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Electricity generator at position(117.5, -30.5)\nConsists of steam engine(position (117.5, -30.5)), boiler(position (111.5, -32.0)), offshore pump(position (106.5, -32.5)), and small electric poles at positions (115.5, -32.5), (115.5, -30.5), (111.5, -30.5), (120.5, -26.5), and (112.5, -24.5)\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(41.0, -80.0)\nConsists of \n- Burner mining drill (position (41.0, -82.0)) and a furnace at position (41.0, -80.0)\n- Furnace at position (60.0, -60.0)\n\n### Copper cable factory\nNo copper cable factory has been constructed yet.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n### Errors when using connect_entities function\n- Ensure that the connect_entities function is called with the correct number of arguments. The function takes 3 positional arguments, but 5 were given in some cases.\n- Make sure to pass the correct type of arguments to the connect_entities function. The function expects integer positions, but float positions were given in some cases.\n\n### Errors when accessing entity positions\n- Ensure that the position attribute of an entity is accessed correctly. The position attribute is an object with x and y attributes, and should not be accessed as if it were another position object.\n\n### Errors when using get_entity function\n- Ensure that the get_entity function is called with the correct type of position object. The function expects a position object with x and y attributes, but a position object with a position attribute was given in some cases.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- The following utility functions have been defined:\n  - connect_entities\n  - get_entity\n- The following variables have been assigned:\n  - offshore_pump: OffshorePump entity\n  - boiler: Boiler entity\n  - steam_engine: SteamEngine entity\n  - burner_inserter: BurnerInserter entity\n  - furnace: Furnace entity\n  - burner_mining_drill: BurnerMiningDrill entity\n  - small_electric_pole: SmallElectricPole entity\n  - pipe: Pipe entity\n  - pipe_group: PipeGroup entity\n  - electricity_group: ElectricityGroup entity\n  - belt_group: BeltGroup entity\n  - belt: Belt entity\n- The connect_entities function has failed due to incorrect argument types and numbers.\n- The get_entity function has failed due to incorrect position object types."}
