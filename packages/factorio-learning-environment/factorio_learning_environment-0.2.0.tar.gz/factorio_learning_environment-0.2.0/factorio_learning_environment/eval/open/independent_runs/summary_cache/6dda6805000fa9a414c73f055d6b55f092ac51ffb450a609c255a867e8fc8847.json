{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll generate a comprehensive report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining Setup at Position(41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (41.0, -82.0) mining coal\n- Input wooden chest (41.5, -80.5) containing 800 coal\n- Two output iron chests (41.5, -84.5) and (41.5, -83.5) each containing 1600 coal\n\n### Iron Smelting System around Position(46.0, -80.0)\nConsists of:\n- Two stone furnaces at (45.0, -81.0) and (47.0, -81.0)\n- Input wooden chest (45.5, -79.5) containing iron ore\n- Output wooden chest (49.5, -80.5) containing 1500 iron plates\n- Two burner inserters:\n  - First inserter (44.5, -79.5) configured to move items from position (43.5, -79.5) to (45.5, -79.5)\n  - Second inserter (46.5, -79.5) configured to move items from position (45.5, -79.5) to (47.5, -79.5)\n\nAdditional wooden chests:\n- Empty wooden chest at (45.5, -84.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Errors\n- Ensure target location is clear before placing entities\n- Check for existing entities that might block placement of new ones\n\n### Inserter Configuration Issues\n- The agent is repeatedly trying to reconfigure inserters, suggesting issues with inserter rotation logic\n- Ensure inserter pickup and drop positions are properly aligned with source and destination entities\n- Current inserter setup appears suboptimal as they are not consistently maintaining their configurations\n\n### Resource Management\n- Coal mining system has reached capacity with full chests\n- Consider implementing a system to manage full storage containers\n- Empty chests when \"chest is full\" warning appears to prevent production stoppage\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nFunctions:\n- get_entity(prototype, position): Retrieves entity at specified position\n- place_entity(prototype, position): Places new entity at specified position\n- rotate_entity(): Adjusts entity rotation\n\nImportant Variables:\n- first_inserter: BurnerInserter\n- second_inserter: BurnerInserter\n\nFailure Modes:\n- get_entity(): Fails when entity of specified type not found at position\n- place_entity(): Fails when target position is occupied\n- rotate_entity(): Multiple attempts needed to achieve desired configuration"}
