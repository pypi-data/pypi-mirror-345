{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\n  - Fuel: 3 units of coal\n  - Current input: 10 units of iron ore\n  - Current output: 4 iron plates\n  - Status: Working\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility at Position (2.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (2.0, 0.0)\n  - Fuel: 4 units of coal\n  - Current input: 16 units of copper ore\n  - Current output: 3 copper plates\n  - Status: Working\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities without required items\n- Ensure that you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to place an entity. For example, a stone furnace could not be placed because it was not in the inventory.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient materials for crafting\n- Verify that you have all required materials before starting a crafting process. For instance, crafting was attempted without sufficient stone for a stone furnace and without enough iron plates for iron gear wheels.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into entities\n- Double-check the availability of items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into an entity. An error occurred when trying to insert iron ore into a furnace without having it in the inventory.\n\n### Assertion errors due to unmet conditions\n- Ensure that conditions are met before assertions are made in the code. For example, assertions failed due to not having enough iron plates in the furnace and failing to extract enough iron plates."}
