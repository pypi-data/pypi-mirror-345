{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-9.5, 24.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Boiler at position (-2.5, 24.0)\n- Steam Engine at position (-5.5, 19.5)\n- Pipe group connecting the Offshore Pump to the Boiler and Steam Engine\n- Electricity group at position (-5.4, 20.0) (not yet connected to the electric network)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure that the pipes are correctly aligned and connected between the Offshore Pump, Boiler, and Steam Engine. Check the expected paths for water and steam pipes and ensure they are clear and correctly placed.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Fuel\n- Ensure that the Boiler has sufficient fuel (coal) to operate. Regularly check the fuel status and replenish as needed.\n\n### Errors in Placing Entities\n- Before attempting to place an entity, verify that you have the required items in your inventory. For example, ensure you have Small Electric Poles before attempting to place them.\n\n### Errors in Electric Network Connection\n- Make sure that the electricity group is properly connected to the electric network. Check the placement of electric poles and ensure they are within range to connect the necessary entities."}
