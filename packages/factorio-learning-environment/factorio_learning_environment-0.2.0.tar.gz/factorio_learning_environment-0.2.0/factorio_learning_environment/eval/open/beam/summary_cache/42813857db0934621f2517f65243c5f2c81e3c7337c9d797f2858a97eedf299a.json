{"content": "The error indicates that there is no nearby power infrastructure (small electric poles) available to connect the assembling machine to a power source. To resolve this, you need to place a new electric pole to provide power to the assembling machine.\n\nHere's how you can address this:\n\n1. **Place a new electric pole**: Ensure that it is within range of both the assembling machine and a power source (if available). If no power source is available, you may need to set up a basic power generation system (e.g., steam engine and boiler).\n\n2. **Connect the assembling machine to the power network**: Ensure that the electric pole is close enough to power the assembling machine.\n\nHere's an updated approach:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Place a new electric pole near the assembling machine\nassembling_machine_position = Position(x=4.5, y=0.5)  # Assuming this is the position of the assembling machine\nplace_entity(Prototype.SmallElectricPole, assembling_machine_position)\n\n# Step 2: Connect the electric pole to a power source\n# If a power source is not available, you may need to set up a basic power generation system\n# For simplicity, let's assume we have a basic setup nearby\npower_source_position = Position(x=2.0, y=0.0)  # Hypothetical position of a power source\nplace_entity(Prototype.SmallElectricPole, power_source_position)\n\n# Step 3: Ensure the assembling machine is powered\n# Check the status of the assembling machine\nassembling_machine_status = inspect_entity(assembling_machine)\nprint(f\"Assembling Machine Status: {assembling_machine_status}\")\n\n# Step 4: Smelt copper ore into copper plates\ncopper_ore_position = nearest(Resource.CopperOre)\nmove_to(copper_ore_position)\nharvested_copper_ore = harvest_resource(copper_ore_position, quantity=10)\nassert harvested_copper_ore > 0, \"Failed to gather copper ore.\"\n\nmove_to(furnace_position)\ninsert_item(Prototype.CopperOre, furnace_entity, quantity=harvested_copper_ore)\n\n# Ensure there is enough coal for smelting\nif furnace_inventory.get(Prototype.Coal, 0) < 50:\n    coal_position = nearest(Resource.Coal)\n    move_to(coal_position)\n    gathered_coal = harvest_resource(coal_position, quantity=5)\n    insert_item(Prototype.Coal, furnace_entity, quantity=gathered_coal)\n\n# Allow time for smelting\nsleep(10)\n\n# Step 5: Extract copper plates and use them in the assembling machine\nfurnace_inventory = inspect_inventory(furnace_entity)\nproduced_copper_plates = furnace_inventory.get(Prototype.CopperPlate, 0)\nif produced_copper_plates > 0:\n    extract_item(Prototype.CopperPlate, furnace_entity.position, quantity=produced_copper_plates)\n\ninsert_item(Prototype.CopperPlate, assembling_machine, quantity=produced_copper_plates)\n\n# Step 6: Confirm copper cable production\nsleep(5)\nassembling_inventory = inspect_inventory(assembling_machine)\ncopper_cables_produced = assembling_inventory.get(Prototype.CopperCable, 0)\nassert copper_cables_produced > 0, \"Copper cable production failed.\"\n\n# Final status update\nprint(f\"Final Inventory: {inspect_inventory()}\")\nprint(f\"Active Entities: {get_entities()}\")\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- **Place Electric Poles**: Ensure electric poles are placed to connect the assembling machine to a power source.\n- **Check Power Network**: Verify that the assembling machine is connected to the power network and receiving power.\n- **Resource Management**: Ensure sufficient resources (coal, copper ore) are available for smelting and production processes.", "summary_range": "[1-90]"}
