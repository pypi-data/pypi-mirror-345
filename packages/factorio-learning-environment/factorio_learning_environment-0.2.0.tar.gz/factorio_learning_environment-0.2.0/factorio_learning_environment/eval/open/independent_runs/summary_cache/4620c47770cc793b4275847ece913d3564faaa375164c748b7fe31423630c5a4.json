{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-44.5, -124.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (-40.5, -113.5)\n- Connected by a series of pipes forming PipeGroup (fluid_system=58349) from Position (-47.5, -122.5) to Position (-42.5, -123.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-15.0, -76.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at Position (-15.5, -77.5)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-19.0, -73.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n- Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) not receiving electricity, connected to a Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5) and Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (6.5, -59.5) containing iron ore, iron plates, and copper plates\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0) actively working with copper ore and producing copper plates\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of:\n- Multiple Small Electric Poles connecting various entities, including positions like (-39.5, -116.5), (-38.5, -114.5), etc.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Extracting Items\n- Ensure the quantity of items to be extracted is greater than zero before attempting extraction. This prevents errors like \"Could not extract copper-plate at (9.0, -64.0): must be greater than 0.\"\n\n### Errors with Power Connectivity\n- Ensure all electrical entities, such as inserters and labs, are connected to a functioning power network to avoid \"not receiving electricity\" and \"no power\" warnings.\n\n### Errors with Fuel and Ingredients\n- Regularly check and refuel mining drills and furnaces to avoid \"out of fuel\" and \"no ingredients to smelt\" warnings. Ensure that chests are not full to continue mining operations."}
