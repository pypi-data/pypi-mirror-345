{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Setup at (15.5,70.5)\nConsists of following entities:\n- Electric mining drill at (15.5,70.5) facing DOWN (not connected to power)\n- Stone furnace at (16.0,73.0) (out of fuel, no ingredients)\n- Burner inserter at (17.5,70.5) (facing furnace, has fuel)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Transport belt connection errors\n- Cannot connect transport belts directly from furnaces - must use an inserter between furnace and belt\n- This error occurred multiple times when trying to connect furnace to belts (steps 2,5,6)\n\n### Entity placement collisions\n- Failed to place burner inserter at (15.5,72.5) due to collision with existing furnace at (16.0,73.0)\n- When placing entities next to others, consider:\n  - Increasing spacing parameter\n  - Changing direction parameter\n  - Choosing different reference position\n  - Checking for nearby blocking entities (this occurred in steps 4 and 7)\n\n### Undefined variable errors\n- Attempted to use undefined variable 'belts' (step 3)\n- Always ensure variables are defined before use, especially after connection attempts that may fail"}
