{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone furnace at position (1.0, 1.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position 1.0, 1.0) which has been processing iron ore and coal, currently with a status of {'iron-ore': 0}.\n\n### Stone furnace at position (2.0, 1.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position 2.0, 1.0) which has been processing copper ore and coal, currently with a status of {'iron-ore': 4}.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to crafting and missing resources\n- Ensure that all required resources are gathered before attempting to craft items. For example, stone is necessary for crafting a stone furnace.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it.\n\n### Errors when moving to a position with incorrect attribute access\n- When moving to a position, ensure that the attributes being accessed are correct. For example, avoid accessing 'x' directly from a 'BoundingBox' object, as it does not have this attribute.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into furnaces with conflicting contents\n- Ensure that you are not trying to insert a type of ore into a furnace that already contains a different type of ore. For example, do not insert iron ore into a furnace that already contains copper ore, and vice versa.\n\n### Errors when attempting to insert items not present in inventory\n- Check your inventory to ensure that you have the required items before attempting to insert them into any entity. For example, do not attempt to insert copper ore if your inventory does not contain any.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into furnaces that are already full\n- Verify that the furnace has space for additional items before attempting to insert them. If a furnace is already processing a different type of ore, it cannot accept new items of a conflicting type.\n\n### Errors related to undefined entities\n- Ensure that the entity you are trying to reference is defined and exists in your current context. For example, the error \"name 'lab' is not defined\" indicates that the variable 'lab' was not properly initialized before use.\n\n### Errors when trying to place an entity not in inventory\n- Verify that you have the required entity in your inventory before attempting to place it. For example, the error \"No lab in inventory\" indicates that the agent attempted to place a lab without having one available.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into furnaces without available ingredients\n- Ensure that the furnace has the necessary ingredients available before attempting to insert items. For example, do not attempt to insert iron ore into a furnace that has no iron ore available in your inventory.\n\n### Errors when inserting coal into furnaces without available coal\n- Make sure to gather coal before attempting to insert it into the furnaces, as they require coal for fuel.\n\n### Errors when inserting coal into furnaces with insufficient coal\n- Ensure that you have enough coal in your inventory before attempting to insert it into the furnaces. For example, do not attempt to insert coal if your inventory does not contain enough coal.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into furnaces that have no ingredients to smelt\n- Check the contents of the furnace before inserting items. If the furnace has no ingredients to smelt, it will not process any items."}
