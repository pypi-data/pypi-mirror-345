{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-40.5, -113.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (-40.5, -113.5)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-46.5, -123.5)\n- Pipe Group connecting offshore pump to steam engine, with pipes at positions (-46.5, -122.5), (-45.5, -122.5), (-44.5, -122.5), (-43.5, -122.5), (-42.5, -122.5), (-42.5, -123.5)\n- Small Electric Poles surrounding the steam engine at various positions for potential power distribution\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -76.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-15.5, -77.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -73.0) with coal as fuel, but currently lacking ingredients to smelt\n- Stone Furnace at position (9.0, -64.0) with coal as fuel, but currently lacking ingredients to smelt\n- Stone Furnace at position (6.0, -62.0) with coal as fuel, producing iron plates\n- Wooden Chest at position (7.5, -61.5) storing iron plates\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) intended to transfer items but not receiving power\n\n### Laboratory Setup\n- Lab with input for automation science packs, but currently not receiving power\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- Multiple Pipe Groups across various positions, primarily empty and not actively transporting fluids\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Attribute Errors with PipeGroup\n- Ensure that the 'PipeGroup' object is correctly referenced and that attributes like 'prototype' are valid for the object in use. Consider reviewing the object definitions and available attributes.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors with Boiler Placement\n- Verify that there is sufficient space and no obstructions in the intended area for placing the boiler. Manually check the area if necessary to ensure a suitable position is available.\n\n### Connection Failures with Pipes\n- Ensure that all pipes are correctly aligned and there are no blockages preventing connections between the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine. Check for any misplaced entities that might obstruct the connection path.\n\n### Refueling Errors\n- Ensure that the boiler is within range of a suitable entity that can accept coal. Verify the proximity and accessibility of the intended refueling target."}
