{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-10.0, -50.0)\nThis facility is designed for producing iron plates from iron ore using a stone furnace. It consists of:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-10.0, -50.0): Used for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserters**:\n  - At position (-15.5, -53.5): Positioned to supply fuel or materials.\n  - At position (-13.5, -52.5): Positioned to supply fuel or materials.\n  - At position (-9.5, -48.5): Positioned to supply fuel or materials.\n\n### Transport Belt Network\nThis network is intended to facilitate the movement of items between different parts of the production facility.\n- **Belt Group**:\n  - Inputs from position (x=-16.5, y=-54.5) to (x=-14.5, y=-54.5), direction: RIGHT.\n  - Outputs from position (x=-12.5, y=-54.5) to (x=-10.5, y=-54.5), direction: RIGHT.\n- **Belt Group**:\n  - Inputs from position (x=-14.5, y=-50.5) to (x=-16.5, y=-50.5), direction: LEFT.\n  - Outputs from position (x=-16.5, y=-55.5) to (x=-14.5, y=-55.5), direction: RIGHT.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Extracting Items from Furnace\n- Ensure that the stone furnace contains the desired output (iron plates) before attempting to extract. Verify that the furnace is properly fueled and has sufficient input materials.\n\n### Errors when Placing Inserters\n- Double-check that there is enough space and a valid position for placing burner inserters. Ensure that the intended position is not occupied by another entity.\n\n### Errors with Insufficient Fuel\n- Maintain a sufficient supply of coal or other fuel types to keep furnaces and inserters operational. Regularly check fuel levels and refuel as necessary.\n\n### Errors in Connecting Belts\n- When connecting belts, ensure that they are not directly connected to entities like stone furnaces. Use inserters to transfer items between belts and other entities.\n\n### General Tips\n- Regularly monitor inventory levels to ensure that all necessary materials and components are available for continued production and construction activities."}
