{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-18.5, 19.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam engine at position(-18.5, 19.5)\n- Boiler at position(-13.5, 20.0)\n- Offshore pump at position(-11.5, 26.5)\n- Small electric poles at positions(-16.5, 19.5), (-16.5, 18.5), (-16.5, 21.5), (-16.5, 20.5), (-19.5, 22.5)\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(-18.0, -49.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at position(-18.0, -49.0) and a furnace at position(-18.0, -49.0)\n\n### Copper cable factory at position(-21.5, 25.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine at position(-21.5, 25.5) and inserter that puts into the assembling machine\n- Beltgroup that connects the furnace at position(-18.0, -49.0) to the assembling machine at position(-21.5, 25.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to fuel availability\n- Ensure to keep coal or other fuel sources in inventory to refuel the boiler. Check inventory regularly to avoid running out of fuel.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it. Check for obstructions in the vicinity of the intended placement.\n\n### Errors related to power connections\n- Verify that all electric poles are correctly placed and connected to the power network. Ensure that entities requiring power are within range of a power source."}
