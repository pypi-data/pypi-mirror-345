{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and is fueled with coal.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-15.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the stone furnace. Currently misaligned with the chest.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates, but is not receiving iron ore due to inserter misalignment.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Alignment Errors\n- Ensure that the inserter's pickup position is correctly aligned with the chest's position. The pickup position should match the chest's position to facilitate the transfer of items.\n- Verify that the inserter's drop position is correctly aligned with the furnace's position to ensure smooth transfer of iron ore for smelting.\n\n### Inserter Fueling Errors\n- Maintain a sufficient supply of coal in the inventory to refuel inserters and other entities that require fuel. Running out of coal can cause inserters to stop functioning.\n\n### Furnace Input Errors\n- Check that the furnace is receiving the necessary ingredients (iron ore) for smelting. Misalignment of the inserter can prevent the transfer of iron ore to the furnace, leading to a lack of ingredients for processing."}
