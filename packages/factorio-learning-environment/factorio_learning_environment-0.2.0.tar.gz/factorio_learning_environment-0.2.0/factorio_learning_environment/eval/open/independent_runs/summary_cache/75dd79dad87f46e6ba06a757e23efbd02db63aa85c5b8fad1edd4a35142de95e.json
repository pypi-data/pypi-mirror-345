{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Electricity generator at position(x=1.5, y=1.0)\nConsists of two boilers at positions (x=1.5, y=1.0) and (x=1.5, y=3.0) and multiple pipes connecting them.\n\n### Electricity generator at position(x=-24.5, y=32.0)\nConsists of a boiler at position (x=-24.5, y=32.0) and a pipe at position (x=-24.5, y=30.5).\n\n### Water supply system at position(x=-16.5, y=26.5)\nConsists of an offshore pump at position (x=-16.5, y=26.5), an offshore pump at position (x=-18.5, y=27.5), and multiple pipes connecting them.\n\n### Pipe network at position(x=1.5, y=-6.5)\nConsists of multiple pipes at various positions, including (x=1.5, y=-6.5), (x=2.5, y=-6.5), and (x=3.5, y=-6.5).\n\n### Pipe network at position(x=3.5, y=-2.5)\nConsists of multiple pipes at various positions, including (x=3.5, y=-2.5), (x=5.5, y=-2.5), and (x=4.5, y=-2.5).\n\n### Water pipe network at position(x=-20.5, y=25.5)\nConsists of multiple pipes at various positions, including (x=-20.5, y=25.5), (x=-19.5, y=25.5), and (x=-18.5, y=25.5).\n\n### Empty pipe network at position(x=-12.5, y=25.5)\nConsists of a single pipe at position (x=-12.5, y=25.5).\n\n### Empty pipe network at position(x=-5.5, y=25.5)\nConsists of a single pipe at position (x=-5.5, y=25.5).\n\n### Electricity distribution network at position(x=7.5, y=-0.5)\nConsists of multiple small electric poles at various positions, including (x=7.5, y=-0.5), (x=7.5, y=2.5), and (x=7.5, y=0.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n* **Failed to connect pipe**: Ensure that the entities are close enough to each other and that there are no obstacles in the way. Check the positions of the offshore pump and boiler to ensure they are correctly aligned.\n* **AttributeError: 'PipeGroup' object has no attribute 'direction'**: PipeGroup objects do not have a direction attribute. Instead, use the position attribute to determine the location of the pipe group.\n* **Failed to connect entities**: Check the positions and connections of the entities to ensure they are correctly aligned and connected. Verify that the entities are not too far apart and that there are no obstacles in the way."}
