{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Complex at (-10, -59)\nConsists of following entities:\n- Three burner mining drills in a row at positions (-10, -59), (-8, -59), and (-6, -59)\n- Three wooden chests at positions (-9.5, -57.5), (-7.5, -57.5), and (-5.5, -57.5) collecting iron ore\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line at (0, 0)\nConsists of following entities:\n- Four stone furnaces in a row at positions (0, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), and (6, 0)\n- Input system:\n  - Four wooden chests at (0.5, -2.5), (2.5, -2.5), (4.5, -2.5), and (6.5, -2.5)\n  - Four burner inserters at (0.5, -1.5), (2.5, -1.5), (4.5, -1.5), and (6.5, -1.5) feeding from chests to furnaces\n- Output system:\n  - Four wooden chests at (0.5, 2.5), (2.5, 1.5), (4.5, 1.5), and (6.5, 1.5)\n  - One burner inserter at (0.5, 1.5) moving items from furnace to output chest\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing inserters in occupied spaces\n- Before placing inserters, verify the target position is clear of other entities\n- Specific positions (2.5, 0.5) and (6.5, 0.5) were blocked by existing entities\n- Consider checking entity dimensions and ensuring proper spacing between components when designing production lines\n\n### Inserter output blocking issues\n- Multiple inserters have warnings about blocked outputs\n- Ensure there is a valid destination entity (like a chest or belt) at the inserter's drop position\n- Current inserters at (0.5, -1.5), (2.5, -1.5), and (4.5, -1.5) are blocked due to missing output entities"}
