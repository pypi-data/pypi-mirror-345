Verify that the fluid_system identifier is correctly set and that an appropriate pipe group is within the required radius.\n  \n- Uniform Fluid_System Assignment:\n  - Ensure that all components within the pipeline network\u2014including the boiler, offshore pump, and pipe groups\u2014share an identical fluid_system. Inconsistencies result in failed connection attempts.\n  \n- Inventory Attribute Consistency:\n  - Use only supported inventory attributes consistently when accessing or modifying inventory items to avoid related errors."}
