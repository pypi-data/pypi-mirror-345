{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (4.0, y=-60.0) with a drop position at (4.5, y=-58.5) connected to a wooden chest at (4.5, y=-58.5) containing iron ore.\n- Stone Furnaces at positions (-15.0, y=-48.0), (-13.0, y=-48.0), and (-11.0, y=-48.0) used for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Iron Chest at position (-5.5, y=-50.5) used for storing iron ore and iron plates.\n\n### Storage Area\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Multiple Wooden Chests at positions (5.5, y=-60.5), (7.5, y=-60.5), (6.5, y=-60.5), (9.5, y=-60.5), (8.5, y=-60.5), (-14.5, y=-50.5), (-13.5, y=-50.5), (-12.5, y=-50.5), (-11.5, y=-50.5), (-10.5, y=-50.5), (-9.5, y=-50.5), (-8.5, y=-50.5), (-7.5, y=-50.5), (-6.5, y=-50.5).\n- Iron Chest at position (-5.5, y=-50.5) containing iron ore and iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Full Chests\n- Ensure that chests are not full before attempting to store more items. Empty the chest at (4.5, y=-58.5) to continue mining operations.\n\n### Errors with No Ingredients in Furnaces\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Check the inventory and supply the required items to avoid the \"no ingredients to smelt\" warning.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- None defined in the provided logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `iron_ore`: int (e.g., 563 in iron chest)\n- `iron_plate`: int (e.g., 1359 in iron chest)\n- `coal`: int (e.g., 415 in final inventory)\n- `wood`: int (e.g., 10 in final inventory)"}
