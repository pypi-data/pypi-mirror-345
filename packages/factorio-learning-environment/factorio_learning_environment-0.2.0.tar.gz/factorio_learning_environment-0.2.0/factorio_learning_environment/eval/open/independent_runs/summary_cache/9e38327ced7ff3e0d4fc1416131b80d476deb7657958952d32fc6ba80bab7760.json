{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Smelting Area at (0,0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace at (0,0) with coal fuel\n- Stone furnace at (2,0) with coal fuel\n\n### Copper Smelting Area at (4,4)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace at (4,4) with coal fuel\n- Stone furnace at (6,4) with coal fuel\n\n### Power Generation System at (-9.5,24.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5,24.5)\n- Boiler at (-2.5,24.0) connected with water pipes\n- Steam engine at (4.5,24.5) connected with steam pipes\n- Small electric pole at (6.5,24.5)\n\n### Research Lab Network\nMultiple labs connected by electricity network:\n- Lab at (18.5,3.5) - powered\n- Lab at (4.5,11.5) - powered  \n- Lab at (23.5,13.5) - powered\n- Lab at (3.5,17.5) - powered\n- Lab at (10.5,22.5) - powered\nSeveral other labs present but unpowered\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Lab Placement Errors\n- Ensure lab is in inventory before attempting to place it\n- Check if the placement area is truly clear and buildable\n- Wait for any processing/crafting to complete before placing labs\n\n### Research Technology Errors\n- Cannot research already completed technologies (like Logistics and Steel Processing)\n- Must research prerequisite technologies before advanced ones (need Logistic Science Pack research before Automation 2)\n- Need to craft required science packs before researching technologies\n\n### Power System Connection Errors\n- Need to have required items (like pipes, electric poles) in inventory before connecting entities\n- Ensure entities are within connection range\n- Check if power poles are properly connected in sequence to form network\n\n### Resource/Fuel Management\n- Monitor coal levels in boilers and add fuel before it runs out\n- Keep sufficient crafting materials in inventory for making required items\n- Need to unlock technology prerequisites before crafting certain items (like Logistic Science Packs)\n\n### Entity Connection Errors\n- Verify connection points between entities are valid and within range\n- Have required connection items (pipes, poles) in inventory before attempting connections\n- Ensure proper sequence when connecting multiple entities in power/fluid networks"}
