{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(0.5, 6.0)\nConsists of boiler (position 0.5, 6.0) and steam engine (position 0.5, 0.5). The boiler is designed to heat water and produce steam, which is then used by the steam engine to generate electricity.\n\n### Copper plate factory at position(-5.0, -65.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position -5.0, -65.0) that smelts iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner mining drill (position 47.0, -82.0) that extracts iron ore from the ground.\n- Belt group (position 40.5, -84.5) that transports materials between the mining drill and the furnace.\n\n### Wooden chests\nMultiple wooden chests are located at various positions:\n- Chest (position 46.5, -83.5) with coal.\n- Chest (position 48.5, -83.5) is empty.\n- Chest (position 5.5, -79.5) is empty.\n- Chest (position 10.5, -79.5) is empty.\n- Chest (position -4.5, -63.5) is empty.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting Boiler and Steam Engine\n- Ensure you have enough pipes in your inventory to connect the boiler and steam engine. Check your inventory before attempting to make the connection.\n\n### Errors when placing Offshore Pump\n- Ensure that the Offshore Pump is in your inventory before attempting to place it. If it is not, gather the necessary resources to craft one.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity onto a tile before attempting to place it. Check for any existing entities occupying the space."}
