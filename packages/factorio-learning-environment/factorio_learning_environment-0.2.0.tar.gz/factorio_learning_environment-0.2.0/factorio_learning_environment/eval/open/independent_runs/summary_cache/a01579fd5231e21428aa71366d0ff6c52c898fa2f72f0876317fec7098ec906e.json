{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace (position (0.0, 0.0)) which is used for smelting ores into plates. Currently, it has coal as fuel and is capable of smelting copper ore into copper plates.\n\n### Wooden chest at position (2.5, 0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Wooden chest (position (2.5, 0.5)) which stores iron plates. It currently contains 50 iron plates.\n\n### Copper plate factory\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace (position (0.0, 0.0)) which smelts copper ore into copper plates.\n- Belt group that connects the stone furnace to the inventory of the agent for extraction of copper plates.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n- **Errors when inserting copper ore into the furnace**\n  - Ensure you have copper ore in your inventory before attempting to insert it into the furnace. Check your inventory status before executing the insert command.\n\n- **Errors when extracting copper plates from the furnace**\n  - Ensure that the stone furnace contains copper plates before attempting to extract them. If the furnace is empty or does not have the required item, the extraction will fail.\n\n- **Errors when crafting Automation Science Pack**\n  - Ensure that you have all required ingredients (copper plates and iron gear wheels) in your inventory before attempting to craft the Automation Science Pack. If any required ingredient is missing, the crafting will fail.\n\n- **Errors when crafting iron gear wheels**\n  - Ensure you have enough iron plates in your inventory to craft iron gear wheels. If there are insufficient iron plates, the crafting will not succeed.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions Defined:**\n  - `insert_item(item, entity, quantity)`: Inserts a specified quantity of an item into a given entity.\n    - Failure Mode: Cannot insert if the item is not present in inventory.\n  - `extract_item(item, entity, quantity)`: Extracts a specified quantity of an item from a given entity.\n    - Failure Mode: Cannot extract if the entity does not contain the item.\n  - `craft_item(item)`: Crafts a specified item if all required ingredients are available.\n    - Failure Mode: Cannot craft if any required ingredients are missing.\n\n- **Important Variables Assigned:**\n  - `current_inventory: dict`: Holds the current inventory of the agent.\n  - `furnace_inventory: dict`: Holds the inventory of the stone furnace.\n  - `chest_inventory: dict`: Holds the inventory of the wooden chest."}
