{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(1.5, 0.0)\nConsists of steam engine (position 1.5, 0.0) and boiler (position 1.5, 0.0).  \n*Note: The boiler could not be placed due to obstruction.*\n\n### Electric pole network\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Small electric pole (position 2.5, 1.0)\n- Electricity group (position 2.5, 0.7) connected to the Lab at position (0.5, 2.5) and small electric poles at positions (3.5, 0.5), (2.5, 2.5), (1.5, 0.5), (2.5, 0.5), and (2.5, -0.5).\n\n### Lab at position(0.5, 2.5)\nConnected to the electric pole network but currently has no power.\n\n### Furnace at position(4.0, -62.0)\nCurrently has coal as fuel but no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing a boiler\n- Ensure the target location for placing the boiler is clear of other entities. Verify the surroundings before attempting to place.\n\n### Errors when using electric poles\n- Check the connection status of electric poles to ensure they are properly plugged into the electric network. If an entity is not receiving power, investigate the connections and the status of nearby electric poles.\n\n### Errors when entities are not powered\n- If a structure such as a Lab is not powered, ensure it is connected to an active electric network. Check for any disconnections or issues with electric poles in the vicinity."}
