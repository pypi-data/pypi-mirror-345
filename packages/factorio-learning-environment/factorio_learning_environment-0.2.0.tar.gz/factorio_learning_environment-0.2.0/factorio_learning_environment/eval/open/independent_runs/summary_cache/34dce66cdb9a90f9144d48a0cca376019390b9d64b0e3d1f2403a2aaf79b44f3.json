Check the input supply and ensure it is connected and operational.\n\n### Errors Due to Out of Fuel in Mining Drills\n- Regularly check the fuel levels of mining drills and refuel them as needed to avoid interruptions in resource extraction.\n\n### Errors When Inserters are Waiting for Source Items\n- Verify that the source items are available and that the inserters are correctly positioned to pick up items from the source. Ensure the transport belts are functioning and delivering items to the inserters."}
