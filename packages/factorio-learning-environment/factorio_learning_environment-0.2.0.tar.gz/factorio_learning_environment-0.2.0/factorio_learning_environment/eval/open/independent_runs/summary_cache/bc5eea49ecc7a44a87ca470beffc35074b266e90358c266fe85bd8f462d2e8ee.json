The final segmented, grid-aligned approach resolves previous endpoint conflicts and ensures copper ore delivery into the production facility.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 Target Type and Connection Errors:\n  - Do not attempt to connect transport belts directly to a Wooden Chest or a SteamEngine. Use an inserter as an intermediary to handle item transfers.\n\n\u2022 Pickup Occupancy Conflicts:\n  - Ensure the target inserter\u2019s pickup area is free from other entities before establishing connections; conflicting objects (e.g. an already placed Wooden Chest) will block the connection.\n\n\u2022 Path Normalisation Issues:\n  - \u201cNot a valid path to normalise\u201d errors occur when intermediate waypoints are misaligned. Verify that all waypoints are grid-aligned and form a continuous path.\n\n\u2022 Endpoint and Parameter Validation:\n  - Always fully specify and validate connection parameters and endpoints to avoid type mismatches and undefined inputs during belt network formation.\n\nNAMESPACE\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n(No user\u2010defined functions were detected in this set of execution steps.)"}
