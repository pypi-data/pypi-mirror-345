{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (8.0, 10.0) used for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserters at positions (1.5, -0.5) and (3.5, -0.5) used for refueling the furnace with coal.\n- A BeltGroup with a belt entity at position (3.5, 1.5) that transports iron plates from the furnace to a chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (6.5, 1.5) used for storing iron plates.\n\n### Temporary Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (10.5, 10.5) used for temporary storage of items.\n\n### Belt System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Multiple BeltGroups that facilitate the movement of items across various positions, including a working BeltGroup with 20 belts transporting iron plates and other resources.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Depositing Items into Chests\n- Ensure that the second argument in the deposit function is an Entity or EntityGroup, not a Position.\n- Check that the target chest has enough space before attempting to deposit items to avoid inventory full errors.\n\n### Errors with Inventory Management\n- Monitor inventory levels to prevent attempting to harvest resources when the inventory is full.\n- Ensure that there is sufficient space in the inventory before harvesting resources.\n\n### Errors with Undefined Entities\n- Ensure that any entity you reference, such as 'additional_chest', is defined and exists in your current context.\n\n### Errors with Crafting\n- Verify that all required raw materials are available before attempting to craft items. For example, stone must be gathered before crafting a stone furnace.\n\n### Errors with Resource Insertion\n- Ensure that the resources you intend to insert, such as iron ore or plates, are available in your inventory before attempting insertion.\n\n### Timeout Errors\n- Avoid using sleep functions that may lead to TimeoutErrors; instead, use event-driven or condition-based waits.\n\nBy addressing these errors, the agent can improve efficiency and reduce operational disruptions."}
