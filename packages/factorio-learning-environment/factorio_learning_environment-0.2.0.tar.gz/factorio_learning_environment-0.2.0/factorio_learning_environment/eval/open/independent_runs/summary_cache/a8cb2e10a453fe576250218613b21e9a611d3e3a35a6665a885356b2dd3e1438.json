{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -48.0), (-13.0, -48.0), (-11.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -48.0) fueled with coal, currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0) fueled with coal, currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0) fueled with coal, currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage at Position (4.0, -60.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (4.0, -60.0) fueled with coal, actively mining iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (4.5, -58.5) storing mined iron ore, currently full.\n- Multiple Wooden Chests at positions (5.5, -60.5), (7.5, -60.5), (6.5, -60.5), (9.5, -60.5), (8.5, -60.5) for additional storage.\n\n### Iron Ore and Plate Storage\n- Iron Chest at position (-5.5, -50.5) storing iron ore and iron plates.\n- Wooden Chests at positions (-14.5, -50.5), (-13.5, -50.5), (-12.5, -50.5), (-11.5, -50.5), (-10.5, -50.5), (-9.5, -50.5), (-8.5, -50.5), (-7.5, -50.5), (-6.5, -50.5) storing iron plates, some of which are full.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Full Chests\n- Ensure that chests are not full to avoid halting production. Regularly check and empty chests at drop positions to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Errors with Furnaces Having No Ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces have a continuous supply of raw materials to smelt. Regularly check and supply the necessary ingredients to avoid idle furnaces.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined by the agent in the provided steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `final_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Represents the final inventory of the agent, including items like wood, coal, iron ore, iron plates, and iron gear wheels."}
