{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=22.5, y=-7.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (x=22.5, y=-7.5)\n- Boiler at Position (x=20.5, y=-4.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (x=19.5, y=-1.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting these entities, starting from Position (x=21.5, y=-10.5) to (x=20.5, y=-5.5)\n- Small Electric Pole at Position (x=24.5, y=-7.5)\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Furnace at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\n- Furnace at Position (x=2.0, y=0.0)\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at Position (x=5.0, y=5.0)\nConsists of:\n- Furnace at Position (x=5.0, y=5.0)\n\n### Water Supply System\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (x=4.5, y=-10.5)\n- PipeGroup starting from Position (x=4.5, y=-9.5) to (x=8.5, y=-7.5)\n\n### Research Lab\nConsists of:\n- Lab with input of 'automation-science-pack' at Position (not specified), currently researching logistics\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Boiler Not Working\n- Ensure that the boiler is properly connected to a water source and has sufficient fuel. Check for any warnings like \"no input liquid\" or \"No fluid present in connections\" and address them by ensuring the pipes are correctly connected and the offshore pump is operational.\n\n### Errors When Using Extracting but Being Too Far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors When Placing into a Tile Which is Occupied by Another Entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
