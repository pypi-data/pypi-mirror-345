{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at position (9.0, -64.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (9.0, -64.0) with coal as fuel and iron ore as input, producing iron plates.\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility at position (-19.0, -73.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -73.0) with coal as fuel, currently not producing due to lack of ingredients.\n\n### Idle Furnace at position (6.0, -62.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (6.0, -62.0) with coal as fuel, currently not producing due to lack of ingredients.\n\n### Storage and Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (7.5, -61.5) for storage.\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) for transferring items, currently not operational due to lack of power.\n- Wooden Chest at position (6.5, -59.5) containing iron plates.\n\n### Research Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab with automation science packs, currently not operational due to lack of power.\n\n### Electricity Infrastructure\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Small Electric Poles at various positions, currently not providing power due to lack of connection or input.\n\n### Steam Power Setup at position (8.5, 36.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (8.5, 36.5), currently not operational due to lack of input liquid and connection to power network.\n\n### Pipe Networks\nConsists of multiple PipeGroups at various positions, currently empty and not operational.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Crafting Due to Insufficient Materials\n- Ensure you have all required materials before attempting to craft an item. For example, crafting iron gear wheels and pipes failed due to insufficient iron plates. Always check your inventory and gather necessary resources beforehand.\n\n### Errors in Crafting Without Appropriate Facilities\n- Some items require specific facilities to craft, such as a furnace for smelting. Ensure you have access to the necessary crafting machines or facilities before attempting to craft such items.\n\n### Errors in Power Management\n- Ensure that all entities requiring power are connected to a functional power network. Verify that your electricity infrastructure is properly set up and connected to power sources to avoid operational downtime.\n\n### Errors in Resource Management\n- Regularly check and replenish the input materials for production facilities to prevent idle time and maximize efficiency. For instance, ensure that furnaces have sufficient fuel and raw materials to maintain continuous production."}
