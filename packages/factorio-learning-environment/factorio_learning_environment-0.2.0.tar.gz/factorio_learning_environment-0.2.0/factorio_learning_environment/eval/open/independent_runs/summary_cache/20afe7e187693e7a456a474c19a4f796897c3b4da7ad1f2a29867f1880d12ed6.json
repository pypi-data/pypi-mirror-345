{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nThis structure is responsible for producing iron plates from iron ore. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Furnace** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Used for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-12.5, -49.5): Transfers items between the furnace and the wooden chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-11.5, -49.5): Stores the produced iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Fuel Management\n- Ensure that all fuel-consuming entities, such as furnaces and inserters, are adequately supplied with fuel to prevent them from running out and halting production.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Operations\n- Verify that inserters have a clear path and are correctly positioned to pick up and drop items between entities. Ensure that they are not waiting for source items due to misalignment or lack of input.\n\nThese tips should help in maintaining a smooth operation of the production facilities and prevent interruptions in the workflow."}
