This will prevent errors related to missing items during insertion operations.\n\n### Warnings about full chests\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are full to continue mining operations without interruption. This will prevent the mining drills from stopping due to full output chests.\n\n### Warnings about no ingredients to smelt\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary raw materials to smelt. This will prevent the furnace from being idle due to a lack of ingredients."}
