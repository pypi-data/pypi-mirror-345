(Note: This furnace recently processed additional iron ore to extract new iron plates.)\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-4.0, y=21.0), used for processing copper ore into copper plates (status: NO_FUEL; warning: [\"out of fuel\"]).\n\n### Automation Lab & Steam Power System (Integrated System)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab at position (x=-7.5, y=18.5), used for automation research.\n- Boiler at position (x=-5.5, y=24.0), used for generating steam (status: NO_FUEL; warning: [\"out of fuel\"]).\n- Generator (Steam Engine) at position (x=-0.5, y=24.5), converting steam into electrical power (status: NOT_CONNECTED; warnings: [\"no input liquid\", \"no fluid present in connections\"]).\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-7.5, y=25.5), supplying water to the system.\n- Electricity Group (id=928) supporting power distribution with small electric poles at positions (x=-0.5, y=11.5), (x=-4.5, y=15.5), (x=0.5, y=14.5), (x=-5.5, y=18.5), (x=-8.5, y=21.5) and (x=-2.5, y=24.5) (voltage: 33).\n- Pipe Groups forming the fluid network:\n   \u2022 PipeGroup (fluid_system=1584) at position (x=-10.5, y=16.5) with pipes at positions (x=-10.5, y=16.5), (x=-9.5, y=17.5), (x=-9.5, y=16.5), (x=-9.5, y=19.5) and (x=-9.5, y=18.5) (status: EMPTY).\n   \u2022 PipeGroup (fluid_system=1585) at position (x=-12.5, y=18.5) (status: EMPTY).\n   \u2022 PipeGroup (fluid_system=1587) at position (x=-8.5, y=20.5) carrying water with pipes at positions (x=-8.5, y=20.5), (x=-7.5, y=21.5), (x=-7.5, y=20.5), (x=-7.5, y=23.5), (x=-7.5, y=22.5) and (x=-7.5, y=24.5) (status: FULL_OUTPUT).\n   \u2022 PipeGroup (fluid_system=1589) at position (x=-2.5, y=21.5) with pipes at positions (x=-2.5, y=21.5), (x=-1.5, y=21.5), (x=-0.5, y=21.5) (status: EMPTY).\n\nNo new structures have been successfully built in recent steps.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n- AssemblingMachine1 Placement Failures:\n  \u2022 Multiple placement attempts for the AssemblingMachine1 (using various directions and spacings) failed due to collisions with existing entities (such as the wooden chest, furnace, electric pole, and lab) or unsuitable terrain (water). To mitigate this, verify the target build location is completely free, consider increasing spacing, adjusting the placement direction, or selecting an alternative reference position.\n  \n- Recipe Setting Errors:\n  \u2022 The error \u201cname 'placed_assembler' is not defined\u201d indicates that a variable expected to reference the deployed AssemblingMachine1 was never correctly assigned. Ensure that the entity placement returns a valid reference before attempting to set recipes.\n  \n- Nearest Buildable Area Search Issues:\n  \u2022 Errors such as \u201cTypeError: 'Position' object is not callable\u201d and \u201cname 'center_pos' is not defined\u201d occurred during attempts to use the nearest buildable area. Check that position objects are treated as data (not called as functions) and that any computed center position variable is properly defined and accessible before use.\n\n"}
