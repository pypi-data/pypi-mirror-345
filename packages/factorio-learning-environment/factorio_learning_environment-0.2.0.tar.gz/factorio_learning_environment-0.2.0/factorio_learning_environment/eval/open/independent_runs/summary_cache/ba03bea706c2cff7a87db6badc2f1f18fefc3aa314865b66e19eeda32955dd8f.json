{"content": "# FACTORIO REPORT\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System (around x=-6.0, y=1.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, -0.5)\n- Boiler at position (-6.0, y=1.5)\n- Steam engine at position (-1.5, y=4.5)\n- Small electric poles at positions (-1.5, 10.5), (-1.5, 7.5)\n- Pipe network connecting these components\n\nThe system has been regularly refueled with coal to maintain operation. The boiler was refueled with 10 coal in steps 121, 124, and 126. The system is producing approximately 25 steam per 60 seconds. The power system has been experiencing intermittent outages due to fuel shortages, affecting the operation of electric components throughout the factory.\n\n### Iron Mining and Smelting Setup (around x=20.5, y=75.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Electric mining drills at positions (16.5, 71.5) and (21.5, 71.5)\n- Stone furnaces at positions (17.0, 75.0) and (22.0, 75.0)\n- Burner inserters at positions (16.5, 73.5) and (21.5, 73.5) connecting drills to furnaces\n- Output inserters at positions (17.5, 76.5), (17.5, 77.5), and (22.5, 77.5)\n- Wooden chest at position (20.5, 78.5) for collecting iron plates\n- Inserter at position (20.5, 76.5) to extract iron plates from chest\n- Transport belt system connecting the iron chest to the circuit assembler\n\nThe mining drills are operational when power is available but are experiencing output blockages. The first furnace has 5 coal remaining with 70 iron plates in its output. The second furnace has 7 coal remaining with 90 iron plates in its output. The wooden chest contains 3 iron plates. Both furnaces are currently waiting for ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Copper Mining and Smelting Setup (around x=-51.5, y=85.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Electric mining drills at positions (-55.5, 81.5) and (-50.5, 81.5)\n- Stone furnaces at positions (-55.0, 85.0) and (-50.0, 85.0)\n- Burner inserters at positions (-55.5, 83.5) and (-50.5, 83.5) connecting drills to furnaces\n- Output inserters at positions (-54.5, 87.5) and (-49.5, 87.5)\n- Wooden chest at position (-52.5, 89.5) for collecting copper plates\n- Inserter at position (-52.5, 87.5) to extract copper plates from chest\n- Transport belt system connecting the copper chest to the copper cable assembler\n\nThe mining drills are operational when power is available but are experiencing output blockages. The first furnace has 6 coal remaining with 74 copper plates in its output. The second furnace has 7 coal remaining with 83 copper plates in its output. The wooden chest is currently empty as copper plates are being consumed by the cable assembler. Both furnaces are currently waiting for ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Copper Cable Assembly (around x=-23.5, y=66.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine at position (-23.5, 66.5) with copper cable recipe\n- Input inserter at position (-25.5, 66.5)\n- Output inserter at position (-21.5, 66.5)\n- Small electric poles connecting to power network\n- Transport belt system bringing copper plates from the copper chest\n- Wooden chest at position (-26.5, 66.5) to collect copper cables\n- Transport belt system carrying copper cables to the electronic circuit assembler\n\nThe assembler has been supplied with copper plates but is currently experiencing ingredient shortages. As of step 127, the wooden chest at position (-26.5, 66.5) contains 4 copper cables. The assembler is currently waiting for more copper plates to continue production.\n\n### Electronic Circuit Assembly (around x=-5.5, y="}
