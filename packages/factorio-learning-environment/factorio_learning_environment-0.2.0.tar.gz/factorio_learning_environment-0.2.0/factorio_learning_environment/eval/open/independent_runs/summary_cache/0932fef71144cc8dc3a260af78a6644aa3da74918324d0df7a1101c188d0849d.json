{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace (position (0.0, 0.0)) with 4 coal as fuel and currently no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position (42.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position (42.0, -83.0)) with 5 coal as fuel.\n\n### Wooden Chest at position (42.5, -81.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest (position (42.5, -81.5)) with 17 coal in its inventory.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n- **Errors when crafting items due to missing raw materials:**\n  - Ensure you gather all required raw materials before attempting to craft items. For example, iron plates require iron ore, and stone furnaces require stone.\n\n- **Errors when crafting items due to missing crafting machines:**\n  - Verify that you have the necessary crafting machines available to create items. For instance, you cannot craft iron plates without a furnace.\n\n- **Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity:**\n  - Ensure that the position you are trying to place an entity is unoccupied before attempting to place it.\n\n- **Errors when attempting to place a building in an unviable location:**\n  - Check for nearby obstacles or terrain types that may prevent placement. Consider adjusting the target position or using a smaller building box size.\n\n- **Errors when placing an inserter next to an occupied position:**\n  - Ensure that the position next to the entity you are trying to place the inserter is unoccupied. Consider changing the direction or increasing the spacing to avoid collisions.\n\n- **Errors when trying to access a NoneType object:**\n  - Ensure that the object you are trying to access is properly initialized and not None before attempting to access its properties.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - `craft_item(Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill, quantity=1)`: Successful.\n  - `place_entity(Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill, position=Position(x=5, y=0), direction=Direction.DOWN)`: Failed due to unplaceable terrain or obstruction.\n  - `nearest_buildable(Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill, BuildingBox(width=2, height=2), Position(x=5, y=0))`: Failed due to no viable place found.\n  - `place_entity(Prototype.WoodenChest, position=drop_position, direction=Direction.UP)`: Failed due to missing item in inventory.\n  - `place_entity_next_to(Prototype.BurnerInserter, ...)`: Failed due to collision with existing entities.\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `inventory`: dict\n  - `entities`: list\n  - `current_inventory`: dict\n  - `furnace_inventory`: dict\n  - `drop_position`: Position"}
