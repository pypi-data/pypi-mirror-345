{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining System at (-15, -15)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (24.0, -15.0)\n- Storage chest at (23.5, -16.5) containing 301 coal\n\n### Iron Ore Mining System at (-14, 23)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-14.0, 23.0)\n- Storage chest at (-14.5, 21.5) containing 313 iron ore\n\n### Iron Smelting Line at (-10, 20)\nConsists of:\n- Two stone furnaces at (-11.0, 20.0) and (-9.0, 20.0)\n\n### Copper Processing System at (22, 20)\nConsists of:\n- Copper ore mining:\n  - Burner mining drill at (20.0, 20.0)\n  - Output chest at (20.5, 21.5) containing 359 copper ore\n- Smelting setup:\n  - Stone furnace at (24.0, 20.0)\n  - Input chest at (22.5, 21.5) containing 377 copper ore\n  - Input inserter at (22.5, 20.5) moving ore from chest to furnace\n  - Output inserter at (24.5, 18.5) moving plates to storage\n  - Output storage chest at (24.5, 17.5) containing 53 copper plates\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with furnace fuel management\n- Check furnace fuel capacity before attempting to insert more coal\n- When furnace shows \"furnace fuel source is full\" (50/50 items), do not attempt to add more fuel\n\n### Inefficient material flow setup\n- Ensure inserters are properly positioned and oriented to effectively move materials between containers\n- Verify the complete production chain is working by checking:\n  - Input material availability\n  - Fuel levels in all machines\n  - Inserter pickup and drop positions\n  - Machine working status\n\n### Entity status monitoring\n- Monitor entity status messages like \"NO_INGREDIENTS\", \"NO_FUEL\", \"WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS\" to identify and fix production line issues\n- Keep burner mining drills fueled to prevent \"out of fuel\" warnings"}
