{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (42.0, -84.0) with a drop position at (41.5, -85.5) and a wooden chest at (41.5, -85.5) containing 521 coal.\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) with a drop position at (40.5, -83.5) and a wooden chest at (40.5, -83.5) containing 520 coal.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (4.0, -60.0) fueled by coal, producing iron plates.\n- Furnace at position (5.0, -60.0) fueled by coal, producing iron plates.\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (1.5, 18.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Boiler at position (1.5, 18.0) with coal fuel, but not connected to any fluid source.\n- Offshore Pump at position (-7.5, 25.5) not connected to the boiler.\n- Multiple PipeGroups attempting to connect the offshore pump to the boiler, but facing placement issues.\n\n### Electrical Infrastructure\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Electricity Group with poles at various positions, including (x=-13.5, y=-42.5) and (x=2.5, y=2.5), but currently not supplying power.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Undefined Name Error\n- Ensure that all classes and objects used in the code are defined. The error `NameError: name 'PipeGroup' is not defined` suggests that the class `PipeGroup` needs to be properly defined or imported before use.\n\n### Attribute Error with BoundingBox\n- Verify that the objects being accessed have the correct attributes. The error `'BoundingBox' object has no attribute 'x'` indicates that the `BoundingBox` object does not have an `x` attribute, and the code should be adjusted accordingly.\n\n### Placement Errors on Water\n- Pipes cannot be placed on water. The error messages indicate that attempts to place pipes at positions overlapping water should be avoided. Ensure that the target position is suitable for placement before attempting to place pipes.\n\n### Connection Issues with Offshore Pumps and Boilers\n- Offshore pumps and boilers need to be correctly connected to function. The status `EntityStatus.NOT_CONNECTED` with warnings about no fluid present indicates that the connections need to be checked and corrected.\n\n### Excess Offshore Pump Placement\n- Avoid placing multiple offshore pumps unnecessarily. Ensure that only the required number of pumps are placed and remove any excess to prevent resource wastage.\n\n### Fuel and Power Supply Issues\n- Ensure that all mining drills and furnaces have sufficient fuel and are connected to a power source. The warnings about being out of fuel or not receiving electricity should be addressed to maintain continuous operation."}
