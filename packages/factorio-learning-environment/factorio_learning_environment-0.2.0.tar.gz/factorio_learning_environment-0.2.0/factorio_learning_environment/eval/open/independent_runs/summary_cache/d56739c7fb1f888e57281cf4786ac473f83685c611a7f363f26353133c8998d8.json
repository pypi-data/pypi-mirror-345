{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) storing iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-9.0, -48.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-14.5, -46.5) transferring items between entities.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-14.5, -45.5) transferring items between entities.\n- Iron Chest at position (-14.5, -47.5) for storage.\n\n### Coal and Iron Ore Extraction Facility at Position (41.5, -80.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) extracting coal.\n- Iron Chest at position (41.5, -80.5) storing coal.\n- Stone Furnace at position (43.0, -82.0) smelting resources.\n- Burner Inserter at position (43.5, -80.5) transferring items between entities.\n- Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -79.5) for storage.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the inserters are correctly positioned and have access to source items. Check if the source entities have items available for the inserters to pick up.\n\n### Chest at Drop Position is Full\n- Regularly check and empty chests at drop positions to prevent mining drills from stopping due to full storage.\n\n### No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Ensure that furnaces have a continuous supply of raw materials to maintain production efficiency. Regularly insert iron ore into furnaces to keep them operational."}
