This includes checking for existing entities or items on the ground.\n\n### Errors when moving entities to new locations\n- Verify that the destination is valid and unoccupied before moving an entity. This can prevent errors related to invalid or occupied positions.\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities from specific positions\n- Confirm the presence of the entity at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it. This can be done by checking the map for the entity's existence at the target coordinates.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into entities\n- Ensure that the required items are available in your inventory before attempting to insert them into an entity. This prevents errors related to missing items.\n\n### Errors due to blocked outputs\n- Regularly clear the output area of drills and other entities to prevent blockages. Ensure that there is a sink entity or storage available to accept the output."}
