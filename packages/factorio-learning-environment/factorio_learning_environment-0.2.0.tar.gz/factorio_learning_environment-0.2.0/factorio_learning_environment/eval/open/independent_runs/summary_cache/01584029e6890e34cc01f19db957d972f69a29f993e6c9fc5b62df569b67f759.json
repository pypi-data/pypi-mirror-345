{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace (position 0.0, 0.0)\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at position (42.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position 42.0, -83.0)\n\n### Wooden Chest at position (42.5, -81.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest (position 42.5, -81.5)\n\n### Inserter at position (42.5, -80.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Inserter (position 42.5, -80.5)\n\n### Inserter at position (43.5, -81.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Inserter (position 43.5, -81.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to burner mining drill\n- Ensure that the burner mining drill has enough fuel to operate. The current status indicates \"NO_FUEL\".\n\n### Errors when using inserters\n- Check if the inserter is waiting for source items or space in destination. If it is waiting for source items, ensure that the source entity has items available. If it is waiting for space in destination, ensure that the destination entity has space available.\n\n### Errors when inserting into the stone furnace\n- Make sure to insert items into the stone furnace only when it is not at capacity. The current status shows that the stone furnace is working, but ensure that it has enough space for additional items.\n\n### Errors when managing inventory\n- Regularly check the inventory of the wooden chest to ensure it has enough items for the inserters to pull from. The wooden chest inventory is decreasing, which may lead to inserters waiting for source items.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the current execution steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `iron_ore`: int\n- `coal`: int\n- `wood`: int\n- `iron_plate`: int"}
