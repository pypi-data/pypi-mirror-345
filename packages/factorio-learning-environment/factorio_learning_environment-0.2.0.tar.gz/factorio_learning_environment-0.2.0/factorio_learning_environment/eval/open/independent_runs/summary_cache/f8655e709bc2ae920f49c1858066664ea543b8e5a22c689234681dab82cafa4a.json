{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Smelting Facility at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0), currently working with coal as fuel.\n- Burner Inserter at position (1.5, 0.5), waiting for source items, connected to a wooden chest at position (2.5, 0.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (2.5, 0.5) containing iron ore.\n\n### Copper Smelting Facility at Position (10.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (10.0, 0.0), currently working with coal as fuel.\n- Burner Inserter at position (11.5, 0.5), working and connected to a wooden chest at position (12.5, 0.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (12.5, 0.5) containing iron plates and copper plates.\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0), working with coal as fuel, connected to a wooden chest at position (40.5, -83.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (40.5, -83.5) containing coal.\n\n### Transport Belt System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Transport Belt at position (4.5, 0.5) functioning properly, part of a belt group connecting various entities.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Using Inserters with No Source Entity\n- Ensure that there is an entity at the source position for the inserter to interact with. Double-check the positions before placing inserters.\n\n### Errors when Inserters are Waiting for Source Items\n- Verify that the source entity is not empty and is supplying the required items to the inserter.\n\n### Errors when Extracting Items from Transport Belts\n- Confirm that the transport belt contains the items you intend to extract. Ensure the belt is not empty and the correct item type is present.\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities in Occupied Tiles\n- Before placing an entity, check if the target tile is free from other entities. Adjust the spacing or change the direction if necessary to avoid conflicts.\n\n### Errors when Transport Belts are Blocked\n- Regularly clear the transport belts to prevent blockages that can halt item movement and cause inserters to wait for space in the destination."}
