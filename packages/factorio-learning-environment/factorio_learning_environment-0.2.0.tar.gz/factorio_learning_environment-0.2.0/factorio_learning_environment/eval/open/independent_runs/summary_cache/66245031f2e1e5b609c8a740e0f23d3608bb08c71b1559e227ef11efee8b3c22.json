{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at Position (-23.0, -66.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (-23.0, -66.0) operational with iron ore input and producing iron plates.\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-25.0, -64.0) connected via transport belts to the furnace.\n- Transport Belt Group connecting the mining drill to the furnace, facilitating the movement of iron ore.\n\n### Copper Ore Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) extracting coal and depositing into a wooden chest at position (52.5, -84.5).\n\n### Iron Ore Extraction and Storage at Position (-14.5, -54.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) extracting iron ore and depositing into a wooden chest at position (-14.5, -54.5).\n\n### Idle Furnace Setup at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Wooden chest at position (1.5, 0.5) connected to the furnace via a burner inserter at position (2.5, 0.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Insufficient Resource Supply\n- Ensure that there is a consistent supply of resources to furnaces and other processing units. Regularly check and replenish the inventory of source chests to avoid idle production lines.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Verify that the source items are available for inserters to pick up. Ensure that the connected chests or belts have the necessary items to prevent inserters from idling.\n\n### Errors with Furnaces Having No Ingredients\n- Regularly supply the necessary ingredients to furnaces to keep them operational. Check the input inventory of furnaces to ensure they have the required materials for processing."}
