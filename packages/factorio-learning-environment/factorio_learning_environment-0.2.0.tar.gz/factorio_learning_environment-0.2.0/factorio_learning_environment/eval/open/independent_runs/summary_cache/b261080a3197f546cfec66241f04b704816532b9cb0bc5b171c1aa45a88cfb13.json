{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Furnace at position (0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position (0, 0)) with a fuel inventory containing coal and a result inventory containing 100 copper plates. The furnace is currently not smelting due to no ingredients available and the result inventory being full.\n\n### Chest at position (2.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest (position (2.5, 0.5)) with an inventory containing 116 copper plates.\n\n### Copper Plate Factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace (position (0, 0)) and a chest (position (2.5, 0.5)) that are connected through item transfers.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n- **Errors when crafting items due to missing ingredients**: Ensure that the required ingredients for crafting are available in the inventory or in the connected structures. In this case, copper plates are required to craft the automation science pack, but the furnace is not producing any due to lack of input materials.\n- **Errors when transferring items**: Verify that there are sufficient items in the source inventory before attempting to transfer them. The logs indicate attempts to transfer copper plates when there were none available in the inventory.\n- **Errors when using crafting machines**: Make sure that the crafting machine is properly configured and has the necessary ingredients to perform the crafting operation.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- **Utility Functions**:\n  - `craft_item(item)`: Invoked multiple times but failed due to missing ingredients.\n  \n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `copper_plate`: int\n  - `stone_furnace`: int\n  - `wood`: int\n  - `iron_plate`: int\n  - `automation_science_pack`: int\n  - `chest_inventory`: dict\n  - `furnace_inventory`: dict"}
