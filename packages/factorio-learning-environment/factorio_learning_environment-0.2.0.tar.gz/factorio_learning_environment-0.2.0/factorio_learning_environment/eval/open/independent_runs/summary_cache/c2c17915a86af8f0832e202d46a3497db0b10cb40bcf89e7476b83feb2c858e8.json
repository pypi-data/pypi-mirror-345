{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (22.5, -7.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (22.5, -7.5)\n- Boiler at Position (20.5, -4.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (19.5, -1.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0) with fuel (coal: 38) and producing iron plates\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (2.0, 0.0) with fuel (coal: 31) and producing copper plates\n- Stone Furnace at Position (5.0, 5.0) with fuel (coal: 38) and producing copper plates\n\n### Research Lab at Position (unknown)\nConsists of:\n- Lab with input of 18 automation science packs, currently not powered\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- PipeGroup at Position (15.5, -14.5) with fluid system 2081, status: FULL_OUTPUT, carrying water\n- PipeGroup at Position (19.5, -12.5) with fluid system 2085, status: EMPTY\n- PipeGroup at Position (18.5, -3.5) with fluid system 2098, status: FULL_OUTPUT, carrying water\n\n### Electricity Network\n- ElectricityGroup with id 1446, consisting of poles at various positions, currently not supplying power\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Inserting Items without Availability\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities. For example, attempting to insert coal into the boiler failed due to lack of coal in the inventory.\n\n### Errors with Unpowered Structures\n- Make sure that all necessary structures, such as labs and steam engines, are connected to a power source and receiving electricity to function properly.\n\n### Errors with Fluid Connections\n- Verify that all fluid connections are properly established and that there are no warnings such as \"no input liquid\" or \"no fluid present in connections\" to ensure the fluid systems are operational."}
