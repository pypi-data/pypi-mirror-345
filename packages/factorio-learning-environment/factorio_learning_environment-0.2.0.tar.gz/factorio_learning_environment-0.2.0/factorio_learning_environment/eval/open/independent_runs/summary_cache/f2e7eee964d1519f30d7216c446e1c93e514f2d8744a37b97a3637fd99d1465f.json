In this case, the agent attempted to extract 5 units of coal when the chest had only 266 units available. \n- **Errors when inserting coal into the burner mining drill**: \n  - The burner mining drill is out of fuel and has a full drop position. Ensure the drop position (wooden chest) is emptied before inserting more coal into the burner mining drill.\n- **Repeated extraction errors**: \n  - The agent has repeatedly attempted to extract 5 units of coal from the wooden chest without success. It is recommended to check the available inventory before attempting to extract.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- **Utility Functions**:\n  - `extract_item(Prototype.Coal, wooden_chest, quantity=5)`: This function has failed multiple times due to insufficient items in the wooden chest.\n  \n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `wooden_chest`: str\n  - `coal`: int\n  - `iron_plate`: int\n  - `burner_mining_drill`: str\n  - `stone_furnace`: str"}
