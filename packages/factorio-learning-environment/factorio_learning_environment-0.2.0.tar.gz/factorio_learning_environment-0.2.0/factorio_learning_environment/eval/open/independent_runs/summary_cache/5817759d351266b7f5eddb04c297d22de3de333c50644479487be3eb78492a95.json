{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo structures have been successfully placed on the map in these steps. The agent repeatedly attempted to supply a Lab at Position(x=0.5, y=2.5) and craft one from available resources, but none were placed due to inventory shortages and production errors. While existing furnaces were referenced for smelting (one at Position(x=5.0, y=5.0) for iron plates and another at Position(x=-27.0, y=-60.0) for copper plates), no new structure was actively created.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 API Usage with get_entities  \n\u2003\u2013 Using a keyword argument ('radius') led to an unexpected argument error.  \n\u2003\u2013 A subsequent call using three positional arguments produced a mismatch in expected parameters.  \n\u2003\u2003Tip: Always consult the function signature and pass parameters in the correct form.\n\n\u2022 Lab Placement and Entity Retrieval  \n\u2003\u2013 An attempt to place a Lab at Position(x=0.5, y=2.5) failed because no Lab was available in inventory.  \n\u2003\u2013 Iterating over lab entities resulted in a \u201cNoneType is not iterable\u201d error.  \n\u2003\u2003Tip: Verify inventory sufficiency and check that retrieved entity lists are not None before processing.\n\n\u2022 Lab Crafting and Resource Chain Issues  \n\u2003\u2013 Multiple lab crafting attempts failed due to missing sub-ingredients (such as iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, and copper-cables).  \n\u2003\u2003Tip: Ensure all precursor items are producible by confirming adequate smelting outputs and crafting capacities before initiating lab production."}
