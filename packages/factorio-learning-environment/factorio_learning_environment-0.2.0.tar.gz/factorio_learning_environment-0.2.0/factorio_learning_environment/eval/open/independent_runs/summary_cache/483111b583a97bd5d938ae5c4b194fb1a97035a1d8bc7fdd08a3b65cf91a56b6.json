{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) storing extracted iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-14.5, -46.5) transferring items from the chest to the furnace.\n\n### Coal Processing Facility at Position (41.5, -80.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) extracting coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -80.5) storing extracted coal.\n- Stone Furnace at position (43.0, -82.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (43.5, -80.5) transferring items from the chest to the furnace.\n\n### Additional Furnaces\n- Stone Furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0) for additional smelting capacity.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-9.0, -48.0) for additional smelting capacity.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Inventory Management\n- Ensure that there is sufficient iron ore in your inventory before attempting to insert it into a furnace. This will prevent errors related to insufficient resources.\n\n### Errors with Full Chests\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are full to ensure continuous operation of mining drills. Full chests will halt the mining process.\n\n### Errors with No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt to avoid idle time and warnings about no ingredients to smelt."}
