## 📦 Installation

> Coming soon to PyPI!

For now, clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/TkRouter.git
cd TkRouter
```

---

## 📚 Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Tkinter (built-in on most systems)

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

```python
from tkrouter.router import Router
from tkrouter.route_view import RouteView
from examples.route_config import ROUTES

root = tk.Tk()
outlet = RouteView(root)
router = Router(routes=ROUTES, outlet=outlet)
router.navigate("/")  # Shows the HomePage
```

---

## 📁 Route Configuration

```python
ROUTES = {
    "/": HomePage,
    "/about": {
        "view": AboutPage,
        "transition": slide_transition
    },
    "*": NotFoundPage
}
```

---

## 🔧 Transitions

Use built-in transitions or create your own:

```python
from tkrouter.transitions import slide_transition, simple_fade_transition
```

---

## 📂 Example Project Structure

This is what a project might look like when using TkRouter:

```
example_app/
├── views.py             # Page components (HomePage, AboutPage, etc.)
├── route_config.py      # All route declarations
└── basic_app.py         # Main application entry point
```

---

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
pytest tests/
```
