{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Smelting Setup at (0,0)\nConsists of two stone furnaces working in parallel:\n- Stone furnace at (0.0, 0.0) processing iron ore to plates\n- Stone furnace at (2.0, 0.0) processing iron ore to plates\nBoth furnaces are operational with coal fuel and iron ore inputs\n\n### Copper Smelting Setup at (4,4)\nConsists of two stone furnaces:\n- Stone furnace at (4.0, 4.0)\n- Stone furnace at (6.0, 4.0)\nBoth furnaces have coal fuel but currently lack copper ore input\n\n### Research Lab at (8.5, 8.5)\nA single lab loaded with automation science packs, currently not functioning due to lack of power\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Technology Research Requirements\n- Research technologies like Automation require the appropriate technology prerequisites and science packs\n\n### Resource Management\n- Always check inventory before attempting to place entities\n- Ensure required raw materials are available before crafting items\n- Some items like wood cannot be crafted and must be gathered from the environment\n\n### Power Infrastructure\n- Labs and other electrical entities require power to function\n- Build power generation (steam engines, boilers) and distribution (electric poles) first\n\n### Crafting Limitations\n- Many items require specific crafting facilities:\n  - Plates require furnace smelting\n  - Advanced items need assembling machines\n  - Some items have technology prerequisites that must be researched first\n\n### Entity Placement\n- Verify entity placement requirements:\n  - Offshore pumps must be placed on water tiles\n  - Ensure you have the entity in inventory before attempting placement\n\n### Resource Extraction\n- Check if containers/furnaces actually contain items before attempting extraction\n- Ensure furnaces have both fuel and ore before expecting output"}
