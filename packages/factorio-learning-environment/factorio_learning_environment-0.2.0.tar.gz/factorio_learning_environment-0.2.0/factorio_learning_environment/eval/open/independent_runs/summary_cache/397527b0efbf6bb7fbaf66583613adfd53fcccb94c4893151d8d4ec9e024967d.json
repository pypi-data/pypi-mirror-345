{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Transport System\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (41.0, -82.0)\n  - Connected to a **Wooden Chest** at position (40.5, -83.5) via a **Transport Belt** at position (39.5, -83.5)\n  - The chest is used for storing mined coal.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0)\n  - Fueled by coal and used for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (1.5, 0.5)\n  - Transfers iron plates from the furnace to a **Wooden Chest** at position (2.5, 0.5).\n- **Transport Belt** and **Burner Inserter** system\n  - Moves iron plates from the chest at (2.5, 0.5) to another chest at (7.5, 0.5) through a series of inserters and belts.\n\n### Copper Plate Production Line\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (10.0, 0.0)\n  - Fueled by coal and used for smelting copper ore into copper plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (8.5, 0.5)\n  - Transfers copper plates from the furnace to a **Wooden Chest** at position (7.5, 0.5).\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (11.5, 0.5)\n  - Transfers copper plates to a **Wooden Chest** at position (12.5, 0.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when extracting items from entities\n- Ensure the target entity contains the items you wish to extract. For example, verify that the wooden chest at position (40.5, -83.5) contains coal before attempting extraction.\n\n### Errors with inserters waiting for source items\n- Check that the source entity has items available for the inserter to pick up. If an inserter is waiting for source items, ensure that the connected source (e.g., a furnace or chest) is not empty.\n\n### Errors with inserters waiting for space in destination\n- Ensure that the destination entity has enough space to accommodate items being transferred by the inserter. Clear space in the destination chest if it is full to avoid blockage.\n\n### Errors with furnaces having no ingredients\n- Make sure that furnaces have the necessary raw materials (iron ore or copper ore) to process. If a furnace shows \"no ingredients to smelt,\" supply the required ore to continue production."}
