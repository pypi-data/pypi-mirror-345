{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (x=53.0, y=-83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=53.0, y=-83.0) connected to two Wooden Chests at positions (x=52.5, y=-84.5) and (x=54.5, y=-84.5) for coal storage.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Transportation System at Position (x=-23.0, y=-68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-23.0, y=-68.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=-23.5, y=-69.5) for copper ore storage.\n- A series of Transport Belts connecting the mining drill to the storage chest.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-54.5) for iron ore storage.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-54.5) transferring items between chests at positions (x=-14.5, y=-54.5) and (x=-12.5, y=-54.5).\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) for smelting iron ore, with a Wooden Chest at position (x=1.5, y=0.5) for storing iron plates.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage and Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-16.5, y=-64.5) storing iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-15.5, y=-64.5) transferring items between chests at positions (x=-16.5, y=-64.5) and (x=-14.5, y=-64.5).\n\n### Belt Systems\nConsists of several BeltGroups for transporting materials across different sections of the map:\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (x=-25.5, y=-70.5) to (x=-23.5, y=-70.5) and (x=-21.5, y=-66.5) to (x=-21.5, y=-68.5).\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (x=-18.5, y=-71.5) to (x=-16.5, y=-71.5).\n- Additional BeltGroups facilitating movement of resources between various positions.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to No Ingredients in Furnaces\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Check the input inventory of furnaces regularly to avoid idle time.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Check that the source chest or belt has items available for the inserter to pick up. Ensure that the supply chain is not interrupted and that all components are functioning correctly.\n\n### Chest is Full\n- Regularly monitor the inventory of chests to prevent overflow. Consider expanding storage capacity or improving the logistics network to handle excess resources.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Not Picking Up Items\n- Verify that inserters are correctly positioned and have access to the items they are supposed to pick up. Adjust the inserter's position or direction if necessary."}
