{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=17.5, y=20.5) with warnings of 'no input liquid' and 'no fluid present in connections', currently not connected.\n- Boiler at position (x=1.5, y=23.0) with a warning of 'out of fuel', currently has no fuel.\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5) which is operational and supplying water.\n- PipeGroup connecting the offshore pump to the boiler, with pipes running from (x=-9.5, y=23.5) to (x=-0.5, y=23.5).\n- PipeGroup intended to connect the boiler to the steam engine, with pipes running from (x=3.5, y=17.5) to (x=10.5, y=21.5).\n\n### Electricity Network\n- Electricity poles are positioned at (x=3.5, y=20.5), (x=14.5, y=20.5), (x=35.5, y=20.5), and others, forming an electricity network with a voltage of 0.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure that the pipes are correctly aligned and connected between the boiler and steam engine. Verify that the pipes are not missing or incorrectly placed to facilitate fluid transfer.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Fuel\n- Regularly check fuel levels in boilers to prevent them from running out of fuel. Ensure a steady supply of fuel to maintain operations.\n\n### Steam Engine Not Receiving Input Liquid\n- Verify that the steam engine is properly connected to the boiler via pipes. Ensure that the fluid system is complete and operational to supply the necessary input liquid.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `connect_entities`: Attempts to connect entities using specified prototypes. Failed to connect pipes from the boiler to the steam engine due to incorrect configuration or missing connections.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `pipes`: List of pipes intended to connect the boiler and steam engine, currently not successfully connected.\n- `fluid_systems`: Represents the fluid systems in use, with IDs 12339 and 12350, indicating separate fluid networks.\n- `voltage`: Represents the voltage in the electricity network, currently at 0, indicating no power generation."}
