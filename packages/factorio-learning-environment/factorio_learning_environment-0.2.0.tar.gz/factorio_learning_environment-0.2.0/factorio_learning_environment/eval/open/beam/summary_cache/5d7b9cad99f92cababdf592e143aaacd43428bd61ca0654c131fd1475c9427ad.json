{"content": "It seems there was an error due to the `create_copper_cable` function not being defined in the current context. Let's redefine the necessary functions and proceed with the crafting process.\n\n### Step 1: Define Functions for Crafting\n\n```python\ndef create_copper_cable():\n    copper_plates_required = 1\n    inventory = inspect_inventory()\n    \n    if inventory.get(Prototype.CopperPlate, 0) >= copper_plates_required:\n        craft_item(Prototype.CopperCable, 2)\n        print(\"Crafted copper cables.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Not enough copper plates to craft copper cables.\")\n\ndef create_electronic_circuit():\n    copper_cables_required = 3\n    iron_plate_required = 1\n    inventory = inspect_inventory()\n    \n    if (inventory.get(Prototype.CopperCable, 0) >= copper_cables_required and\n        inventory.get(Prototype.IronPlate, 0) >= iron_plate_required):\n        craft_item(Prototype.ElectronicCircuit, 1)\n        print(\"Crafted electronic circuit.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Not enough materials to craft the electronic circuit.\")\n```\n\n### Step 2: Execute Crafting Steps\n\n```python\n# Smelt copper ore into copper plates\nfurnaces = get_entities({Prototype.StoneFurnace})\nif furnaces:\n    furnace = furnaces[0]\n    insert_item(Prototype.CopperOre, furnace, quantity=10)\n    print(\"Inserted copper ore into the furnace for smelting.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No available furnaces to smelt copper ore.\")\n\n# Wait for smelting to complete\nsleep(5)\n\n# Craft copper cables and electronic circuits\ncreate_copper_cable()\ncreate_electronic_circuit()\n\n# Check inventory after crafting\ninventory = inspect_inventory()\nprint(\"Inventory after crafting:\", inventory)\n\n# Attempt to craft the Offshore Pump\nif inventory.get(Prototype.ElectronicCircuit, 0) > 0:\n    craft_item(Prototype.OffshorePump, 1)\n    print(\"Crafted offshore pump.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Failed to craft offshore pump due to missing electronic circuit.\")\n```\n\n### Step 3: Continue Setup\n\nOnce the crafting is complete and the necessary components are available, proceed with placing and connecting the entities as previously outlined. This will involve placing the offshore pump, boiler, steam engine, and electric pole, and ensuring all connections are properly established.", "summary_range": "[1-316]"}
