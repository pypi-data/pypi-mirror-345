{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-20.0, y=-70.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (-20.0, y=-70.0) with a status of NO_INGREDIENTS.\n- Furnace at position (-18.0, y=-70.0) with a status of FULL_OUTPUT.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Transport System at Position (-23.0, y=-68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, y=-68.0) with a status of NO_FUEL.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-23.5, y=-69.5) storing copper ore.\n- Transport Belts connecting the drill to the chest and other entities.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-14.0, y=-53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, y=-53.0) with a status of WORKING.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, y=-54.5) storing iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, y=-54.5) with a status of WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-12.5, y=-54.5) storing iron ore.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage Facility at Position (-16.5, y=-64.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (-16.5, y=-64.5) storing iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-17.5, y=-64.5) with a status of WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS.\n\n### Miscellaneous Storage Facilities\n- Wooden Chest at position (1.5, y=0.5) storing coal, iron ore, and iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (3.5, y=0.5) currently empty.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Functionality\n- Ensure that inserters have access to source items and are correctly aligned with both the pickup and drop positions to avoid issues with them not working.\n\n### Errors in Entity Retrieval\n- Verify the existence and correct positioning of entities before attempting to retrieve them to avoid exceptions related to missing entities, such as the wooden chest at position x=-18.5 y=-64.5.\n\n### Fuel Management Errors\n- Regularly check and refuel mining drills and other fuel-dependent entities to prevent them from running out of fuel and halting production.\n\n### Output Management for Furnaces\n- Monitor furnace output to ensure it does not become full, which can halt production. Consider adding more storage or improving logistics to handle excess output efficiently."}
