{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate and Copper Plate Production at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) which is currently fueled with coal. The furnace is processing iron ore into iron plates and copper ore into copper plates. The furnace has 28 units of coal and is actively working, with a warning of \"no ingredients to smelt\".\n\n### Storage Facility at Position (2.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entity:\n- Wooden Chest at position (2.5, 0.5) for storing items. The chest is currently empty.\n\n### Inserter Setup at Position (1.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Inserter at position (1.5, 0.5) intended to feed resources into the furnace at position (0.0, 0.0). Currently not operational due to lack of power connection.\n- Small Electric Pole at position (2.5, 1.5) intended to provide power to the inserter, but currently not supplying electricity.\n\n### Water Extraction and Steam Power Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5) to extract water. Now connected to the boiler with pipes.\n- Boiler at position (-7.5, 22.0) fueled with coal, intended to heat water. It is now receiving water input from the offshore pump.\n- Steam Engine at position (-3.5, 23.5) connected to the boiler, intended to generate electricity. Currently not operational due to lack of fluid input and not being connected to the power network.\n\n### Small Electric Pole Network\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Small Electric Poles at positions (-0.5, 23.5), (0.5, 23.5), (1.5, 23.5), (2.5, 23.5), (3.5, 23.5), (4.5, 23.5), (5.5, 23.5), (6.5, 23.5), and (7.5, 23.5) intended to connect to the power network. Currently not connected due to insufficient items in inventory to complete the connection.\n- Additional Small Electric Pole placed at position (6.5, 1.5) to assist in connecting the inserter to the power network.\n\n### Pipe Network\nConsists of the following entities:\n- PipeGroup at position (x=-6.5, y=19.5) with pipes at (x=-6.5, y=19.5) and (x=-6.5, y=20.5) currently empty.\n- PipeGroup at position (x=-9.5, y=23.5) with pipes at (x=-9.5, y=23.5) and (x=-9.5, y=22.5) currently full with water.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities without having them in inventory\n- Ensure that you have the required entity in your inventory before attempting to place it on the map. For example, before placing a stone furnace, make sure it exists in your inventory.\n- Ensure that you have an offshore pump in your inventory before attempting to place it on the map. Attempting to place an offshore pump at (-9.0, 25.0) without having it in inventory resulted in an error.\n\n### Errors when crafting items without having the required raw resources\n- Before attempting to craft an item, ensure you have all the necessary raw resources. For example, to craft a wooden chest, you need wood, which must be gathered as it is a raw resource and not craftable.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing. For instance, avoid placing a small electric pole at (2.5, 0.5) if there is an existing object in the way.\n\n### Errors when crafting items that require intermediate products\n- When crafting complex items, ensure you have all the necessary intermediate products. For instance, crafting an inserter requires electronic circuits, which in turn require copper cables and copper plates. Copper plates need to be smelted in a furnace. Ensure you have the necessary infrastructure and resources to produce these intermediate products before crafting the final item.\n- Ensure that you have the required crafting machines or smelting setups for items like copper plates, which cannot be crafted directly and require a furnace.\n\n### Errors related to insufficient smelting of copper plates\n- Ensure that copper ore is being processed in a furnace to produce copper plates before attempting to use them. If you encounter an assertion error regarding unsmelted copper plates, check that the furnace is operational and has the necessary copper ore and fuel.\n\n### Errors when inserting items"}
