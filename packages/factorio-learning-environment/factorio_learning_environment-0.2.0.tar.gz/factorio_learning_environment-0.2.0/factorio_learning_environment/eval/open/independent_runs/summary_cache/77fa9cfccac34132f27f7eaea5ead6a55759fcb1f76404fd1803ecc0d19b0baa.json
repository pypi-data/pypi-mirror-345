{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -49.0) used for smelting iron ore into iron plates. Currently has 2 units of coal as fuel and has produced 59 iron plates. It is in a \"NO_INGREDIENTS\" status indicating it requires more iron ore to continue production.\n\n### Coal Mining Setup at Position (42.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (42.0, -83.0) which is extracting coal. It is fueled with 5 units of coal and is currently working, but has a warning indicating \"output blocked by item on the ground\" due to no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n\n### Wooden Chest for Coal Collection at Position (200.5, -80.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (200.5, -80.5) intended to collect coal. Currently, the inventory is empty.\n\n### Additional Wooden Chest at Position (0.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (0.5, 0.5) with an empty inventory.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Wooden Chests\n- Ensure that the intended position for placing a Wooden Chest is valid and unoccupied by other entities. Verify that you have the required wooden chests in your inventory before attempting to place them.\n\n### Errors with BuildingBox Validation\n- When specifying dimensions for a building area, ensure that the height and width are valid integers. Avoid using non-integer values or incorrect data types.\n\n### Errors with Transport Belt Connections\n- Define the 'TransportBelt' correctly in your code before attempting to verify or adjust connections. Ensure that transport belts are connected using inserters when interacting with chests, as belts cannot connect directly to a Wooden Chest.\n\n### Errors when Placing Burner Inserters\n- Verify that the intended position for placing a Burner Inserter is valid and not obstructed by other entities. Ensure there is a clear path for the inserter to operate effectively."}
