These iron plates are essential as a core resource for subsequent production requirements.\n\n### Copper Plate Furnace at Position(\u201327.0, \u201360.0)\nConsists of a single furnace unit used to convert copper ore into copper plates. This processing unit supports the production chain necessary for generating copper\u2010based components.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 API Usage for Entity Retrieval:\n  \u2013 Avoid including unsupported keyword arguments (such as \u201cradius\u201d) when calling get_entities.\n  \u2013 Do not pass unexpected positional arguments; follow the documented call signature.\n  \u2013 Validate the return value from get_entities before iterating to prevent treating None as an iterable.\n\n\u2022 Lab Placement and Crafting:\n  \u2013 Ensure that a Lab item is present in the inventory before attempting to place it.\n  \u2013 Confirm resource sufficiency for all sub\u2010ingredients (for example, iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, and copper-cables) required for Lab production.\n  \u2013 Validate the complete production chain and inventory status prior to initiating lab crafting to avoid cascading missing-ingredient errors."}
