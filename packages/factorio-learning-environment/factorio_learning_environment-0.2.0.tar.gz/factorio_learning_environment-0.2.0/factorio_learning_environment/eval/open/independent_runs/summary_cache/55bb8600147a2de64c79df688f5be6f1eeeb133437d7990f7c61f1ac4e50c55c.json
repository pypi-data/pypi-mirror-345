{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) with a fuel inventory of coal. It is connected to:\n  - **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-15.5, y=-51.5) which stores extracted iron ore.\n  - **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-51.5) that moves items from the mining drill to a transport belt.\n- **Transport Belt** system connecting the mining drill to the furnace, with segments from (x=-13.5, y=-51.5) to (x=-11.5, y=-51.5) and from (x=0.5, y=-3.5) to (x=0.5, y=-1.5).\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) used for smelting iron ore into iron plates. It is fueled by coal.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=0.5, y=-1.5) that moves items from the transport belt into the furnace.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items without sufficient inventory\n- Ensure that the required items are available in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. For example, trying to insert coal into a furnace without having coal in the inventory will result in an error.\n\n### Warnings about full storage\n- Regularly check and empty storage entities like chests to ensure continuous operation of connected machinery. For instance, the chest at position (x=-15.5, y=-51.5) was full, which could halt mining operations.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- **insert_item**: This function attempts to insert a specified quantity of an item into a target entity. Ensure the item exists in the inventory before calling this function to avoid errors.\n\n### Important Variables\n- **furnace**: Represents the furnace entity where items are inserted for processing.\n- **mining_drill**: Represents the mining drill entity used for extracting resources.\n- **chest**: Represents storage entities on the map, such as the wooden chest at position (x=-15.5, y=-51.5)."}
