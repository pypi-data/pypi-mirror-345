{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Lab at position (6.5, 1.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab (position (6.5, 1.5)) with status: EntityStatus.NO_POWER\n\n### Small Electric Pole at position (2.5, 1.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Small Electric Pole (position (2.5, 1.5)) with voltage: 0.0\n\n### Small Electric Pole at position (6.5, 3.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Small Electric Pole (position (6.5, 3.5))\n\n### Furnace at position (1.0, 1.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace (position (1.0, 1.0)) with status: EntityStatus.NO_INGREDIENTS\n\n### Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump (position (-9.5, 24.5)) with status: EntityStatus.NOT_CONNECTED\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at position (3.5, 3.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position (3.5, 3.5)) and a furnace at position (3.5, 1.5)\n- Burner mining drill (position (3.5, 5.5)) and a furnace at position (3.5, 1.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when trying to access entities that do not exist\n- Ensure that the entity you are trying to access is present at the specified position before attempting to get it. For example, the lab at position (3.5, 3.5) was not found.\n\n### Errors when connecting entities to power\n- Check that the electric pole you are trying to connect to has sufficient voltage. The nearest electric pole at (2.5, 1.5) had a voltage of 0.0, which means it cannot power connected entities.\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied positions\n- Ensure that the target position is clear before attempting to place an entity. The attempt to place a small electric pole at (6.5, 2.5) failed due to an existing object in the way.\n\n### Errors related to accessing attributes of objects\n- Verify that you are accessing the correct attributes of the entity. The error regarding the electric pole's voltage was due to trying to access a non-existent 'energy' attribute on the ElectricityGroup object. Use the correct attribute names as defined in the API."}
