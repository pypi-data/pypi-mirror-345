{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-25.0, -64.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-25.0, -64.0) connected to a Stone Furnace at position (-23.0, -66.0) via Transport Belts.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-24.5, -66.5) storing iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-20.5, -65.5) transferring items from a Wooden Chest at position (-21.5, -65.5) to a Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -65.0).\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -54.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0).\n- Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5).\n- Burner Inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) transferring items to the Wooden Chest.\n\n### Belt Groups\n- Belt Group connecting positions (-25.5, -65.5) to (-23.5, -65.5).\n- Belt Group connecting positions (-24.5, -64.5) to (-22.5, -64.5).\n- Belt Group connecting positions (-14.5, -54.5) to (-17.5, -59.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting transport belts\n- Ensure that all entities involved in the connection have valid attributes and are correctly instantiated before attempting to connect transport belts. The error indicates a 'NoneType' object issue, suggesting that one or more entities may not be properly initialized or are missing necessary attributes.\n\n### Errors due to blocked outputs\n- Ensure that the output of a mining drill or any other entity is not blocked by items on the ground. Place a sink entity, such as a chest or a belt, to accept the output and prevent blockage.\n\n### Errors with furnaces lacking ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Check that the input source is correctly configured and that there are no warnings indicating a lack of ingredients."}
