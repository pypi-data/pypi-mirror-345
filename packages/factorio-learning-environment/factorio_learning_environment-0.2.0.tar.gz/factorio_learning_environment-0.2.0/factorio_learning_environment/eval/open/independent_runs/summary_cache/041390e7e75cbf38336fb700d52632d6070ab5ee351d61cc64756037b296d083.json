{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (41.0, -80.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) with a drop position at (41.5, -80.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (41.0, -80.0)\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility at Position (-20.0, -71.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-21.0, -73.0) with a drop position at (-20.5, -71.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -71.0)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Incorrect Attribute Access\n- Ensure that the correct attribute names are used when accessing class attributes. For example, use `StoneFurnace` instead of `Furnace` when accessing attributes of the `Prototype` class.\n\n### Out of Fuel Warnings\n- Regularly check and refuel entities such as Burner Mining Drills and Stone Furnaces to prevent them from running out of fuel and halting production.\n\n### Output Blocked by Item on the Ground\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity, such as a furnace or chest, in place to accept the output from mining drills to prevent blockage and production stoppage.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `get_entity`: A function likely intended to retrieve an entity based on a prototype and position. Ensure correct attribute names are used to avoid `AttributeError`.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `stone_furnace`: Intended to hold a reference to a furnace entity. Ensure correct initialization to avoid errors."}
