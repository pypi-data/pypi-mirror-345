{"content": "\"\"\"\nWe successfully inserted 2 units of iron ore into the new stone furnace, which is now working with 1 iron ore remaining to be processed.\n\nCurrent Inventory:\n- 1 stone furnace\n- 3 iron plates\n\nEntities on the map show:\n1. The new stone furnace is operational with 1 iron ore left and 7 wood as fuel.\n2. The second furnace has 15 wood but no ingredients to smelt.\n3. The last furnace is out of fuel and has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Next Steps\n1. We should monitor the new stone furnace to see how many iron plates it produces as it processes the remaining iron ore.\n2. After that, we can check our total count of iron plates and plan to craft a burner mining drill.\n\nLet's wait for a short duration to allow the new stone furnace to smelt the remaining iron ore.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Wait for a short duration to allow the new stone furnace to process the iron ore\nfor _ in range(10):  # Checking over 10 seconds\n    sleep(1)  # Waits 1 second between checks\n    new_furnace_status = inspect_inventory(new_furnace)\n    \n    if new_furnace_status.get(Prototype.IronPlate, 1) >= 1:  # Look for iron plates\n        print(\"Iron plate(s) are ready for extraction from the new furnace.\")\n        break\nelse:\n    print(\"Smelting timeout - check fuel and inputs for the new furnace.\")  # If we didn't find iron plates after 10 seconds\n\n# Check for iron plates in the new stone furnace\nprint(f\"New Stone Furnace Inventory after waiting: {inspect_inventory(new_furnace)}\") ", "summary_range": "[1-64]"}
