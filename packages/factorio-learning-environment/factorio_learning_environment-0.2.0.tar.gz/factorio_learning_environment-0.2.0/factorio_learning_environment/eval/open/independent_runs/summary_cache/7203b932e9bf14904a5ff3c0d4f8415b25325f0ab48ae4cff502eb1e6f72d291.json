{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-0.5, 25.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (-0.5, 25.5)\n- Boiler at position (-5.5, 25.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine with various pipes at positions such as (-9.5, 22.5), (-9.5, 23.5), (-8.5, 22.5), (-7.5, 22.5), etc.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (15.0, 0.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (5.5, 0.5) containing iron ore\n- Inserters at positions (16.5, 0.5) and (17.5, 0.5) for moving items between the chest and furnace\n- Wooden Chest at position (18.5, 0.5) for storing output\n- Small Electric Pole at position (17.5, -0.5) for power distribution\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Pipe Placement\n- Ensure that the intended tile for pipe placement is not obstructed by other entities or terrain features before attempting to place pipes.\n- Adjust the positioning of pipes to ensure connectivity between the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine.\n\n### Boiler and Steam Engine Connectivity Issues\n- Verify that the boiler and steam engine are properly connected to the water source and each other to ensure they are operational.\n- Check for any missing or incorrectly placed pipes that might disrupt the fluid flow.\n\n### Inserter Power Issues\n- Ensure that inserters are connected to a power source to function properly. Check the connection to the small electric pole and ensure it is receiving power.\n\n### Offshore Pump Connectivity\n- Confirm that the offshore pump is correctly connected to the fluid system and that there are no missing pipes that could prevent water from reaching the boiler."}
