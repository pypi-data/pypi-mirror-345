For example, ensure coal is available before trying to insert it into a boiler.\n\n### Errors Related to Power Supply\n- Check that all entities requiring electricity are connected to a power source. Ensure that small electric poles are correctly placed to provide power to machines like the assembling machine and inserters.\n\n### Errors Due to Missing Ingredients\n- Verify that all required ingredients are available for production processes. For instance, ensure copper plates are available for the assembling machine to produce copper cables.\n\n### Errors Due to Fuel Shortages\n- Regularly check fuel levels in entities like boilers and burner mining drills to prevent interruptions in production due to fuel shortages."}
