{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (20.5, -4.0)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (4.5, -10.5)\n- Boiler at Position (20.5, -4.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (27.5, -7.5)\n- Pipe Group connecting the components, starting from Position (5.5, -8.5) to various positions, carrying water and steam.\n\n### Iron Plate Production at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-11.0, 20.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at Position (-11.5, 18.5) for iron ore collection.\n- Stone Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Copper Plate Production at Position (2.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (20.0, 20.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at Position (19.5, 18.5) for copper ore collection.\n- Stone Furnace at Position (2.0, 0.0) for smelting copper ore into copper plates.\n\n### Copper Cable Factory at Position (10.5, 0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling Machine at Position (10.5, 0.5) with a recipe for copper cable.\n- Inserter at Position (13.5, 0.5) for inputting copper plates.\n- Belt Group connecting the furnace at Position (2.0, 0.0) to the Assembling Machine at Position (10.5, 0.5).\n\n### Inserter and Chest Network\n- Multiple Inserters at various positions (e.g., x=-3.5, y=1.5; x=3.5, y=0.5) with operational issues.\n- Wooden Chests at various positions (e.g., x=-3.5, y=0.5; x=4.5, y=1.5) for storage.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Operational Issues\n- Ensure that inserters have a clear path to transfer items between source and destination. Check for blockages or missing entities at the destination.\n\n### Errors When Placing Entities\n- Before placing an entity, verify that the target position is unoccupied and suitable for placement to avoid conflicts with existing objects.\n\n### Assembling Machine Resource Shortage\n- Ensure that the assembling machine has the necessary resources available to avoid production halts due to missing ingredients.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Verify that the source entity has items available for the inserter to pick up to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Inserter Output Blocked\n- Make sure there is a valid destination for the inserter's output to prevent blockages. Ensure that the destination entity can accept the items being transferred."}
