{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (22.5, -7.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (19.5, -1.5)\n- Boiler at Position (20.5, -4.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (22.5, -7.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (2.0, 0.0) for smelting copper ore into copper plates\n- Stone Furnace at Position (5.0, 5.0) for additional copper plate production\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates\n\n### Storage and Inserter System\nConsists of:\n- Wooden Chest at Position (-3.5, 0.5)\n- Inserter at Position (-3.5, 1.5) connected to the wooden chest\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- PipeGroup at Position (19.5, -12.5) for fluid transport\n- PipeGroup at Position (4.5, -9.5) for water transport from the offshore pump\n- PipeGroup at Position (18.5, -3.5) for fluid transport\n- PipeGroup at Position (19.5, -2.5) for water transport from the offshore pump\n\n### Electricity Network\n- ElectricityGroup with poles spanning positions from (-3.5, 2.5) to (-1.5, 0.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Boiler Not Receiving Water\n- Ensure that the boiler is correctly connected to a water source. Check the pipe connections between the offshore pump and the boiler to ensure there are no breaks or misalignments.\n\n### Steam Engine Not Receiving Input Liquid\n- Verify that the steam engine is properly connected to the boiler and that the boiler is operational with a sufficient fuel supply.\n\n### Inserter Not Receiving Electricity\n- Check the electricity network to ensure that the inserter is within the coverage area of an active electric pole. Ensure that the electric poles are connected and have power.\n\n### Furnace Lacking Ingredients\n- Ensure that the furnaces have a continuous supply of raw materials (iron ore or copper ore) to maintain production."}
