{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-12.0, y=-51.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-11.5, y=-48.5) feeding the Stone Furnace\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-8.5, y=-49.5) for storing iron plates\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-46.5) for additional item handling\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-13.5, y=-45.5) for storage\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=52.0, y=-82.0)\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=52.5, y=-79.5) for moving coal\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=52.5, y=-77.5) for storing mined coal\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities without sufficient inventory\n- Ensure you have the required entities in your inventory before attempting to place them. For example, the attempt to place a wooden chest failed due to lack of wooden chests in the inventory.\n\n### Errors when inserting items without sufficient inventory\n- Verify that you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. For instance, attempts to insert iron ore into the stone furnace failed due to a lack of iron ore in the inventory.\n\n### Errors in crafting due to missing raw resources\n- Gather all required raw resources before attempting to craft items. The crafting of wooden chests failed because the necessary wood was not available.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `place_entity(entity_type: Prototype, position: Position) -> Entity`: Attempts to place an entity of the specified type at the given position. Requires the entity to be available in the inventory.\n- `insert_item(item_type: Prototype, target_entity: Entity, quantity: int) -> None`: Inserts a specified quantity of an item into a target entity. Requires the item to be available in the inventory.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `coal_chest: Optional[Entity]`: Represents a wooden chest intended for storing coal.\n- `stone_furnace: Optional[Entity]`: Represents a stone furnace used for smelting iron ore."}
