{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nThis facility is designed to extract and process iron ore into iron plates. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and deposits it into a chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Temporarily stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates, but currently not receiving iron ore due to setup issues.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Misalignment of Inserter\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items from the chest to the furnace. Regularly check the setup to confirm that the inserter is functioning as intended.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Iron Ore\n- Verify the inserter setup to ensure it is correctly transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace. The inserter must be fueled and properly aligned with both the chest and the furnace.\n\n### Chest Full Warning\n- Regularly monitor the chest's inventory to prevent it from becoming full. Extract items from the chest to free up space and allow continuous operation of the mining drill.\n\n### Inserter Out of Fuel\n- Keep the inserter fueled to maintain continuous operation. Regularly check fuel levels and refuel as necessary to avoid interruptions in the transfer process.\n\n### Furnace Out of Ingredients\n- Ensure that the furnace is receiving a steady supply of iron ore to maintain production. Address any misalignment or fueling issues with the inserter that may be preventing the transfer of iron ore."}
