{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report (Steps 8-15)\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at position (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump (position x=-9.5 y=-0.5)\n- Boiler (position x=-5.0 y=2.5)\n- Steam engine (position x=0.5 y=6.5)\n- Connected with pipe groups:\n  - Water pipes from pump to boiler (positions: x=-8.5,y=-0.5; x=-7.5,y=-0.5; x=-6.5,y=0.5; x=-7.5,y=0.5; x=-5.5,y=0.5)\n  - Steam pipes from boiler to engine (positions: x=-2.5,y=2.5; x=-3.5,y=3.5; x=-3.5,y=2.5; x=3.5,y=4.5; x=-2.5,y=6.5; x=3.5,y=6.5)\n\n### Stone Mining and Smelting Operation at position (-49.5, 10.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill (position x=-49.5 y=10.5)\n- Stone furnace (position x=-46.0 y=11.0)\n- Input inserter (position x=-47.5 y=10.5)\n- Output chest (position x=-44.5 y=11.5)\n- Power pole (position x=-46.5 y=12.5)\n- Currently experiencing power issues (separate power network)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Belt and inserter connection issues\n- Transport belts cannot connect directly to furnaces (step 8)\n  - Always use inserters between belts and furnaces\n  - Verify inserter pickup/drop positions align with belt directions\n\n### Entity placement conflicts\n- Repeated inserter placement failures (steps 12, 13, 14, 15)\n  - Clear target area completely before placing new inserters\n  - Verify no existing entities occupy the placement position\n  - Check for hidden entities like underground belts\n\n### Power system problems\n- Mining drill showing \"no power\" status (step 10, 15)\n  - Verify power poles are properly connected to main grid\n  - Check power production meets demand (steam engine output)\n  - Ensure all production buildings are within power pole coverage\n\n### API usage errors\n- Incorrect attribute access (step 11)\n  - Verify object properties before accessing them\n  - Check API documentation for correct attribute names\n\n### Production chain setup\n- Furnace showing \"no fuel\" status (step 15)\n  - Ensure furnaces have fuel (coal) available\n  - Verify inserter connections between fuel source and furnace\n  - Check fuel inserter is powered and oriented correctly\n\n### Power network isolation\n- Separate power networks not connected (step 15)\n  - Ensure all power poles are interconnected\n  - Verify power networks merge when poles are placed within connection range\n  - Check power pole spacing doesn't exceed maximum connection distance"}
