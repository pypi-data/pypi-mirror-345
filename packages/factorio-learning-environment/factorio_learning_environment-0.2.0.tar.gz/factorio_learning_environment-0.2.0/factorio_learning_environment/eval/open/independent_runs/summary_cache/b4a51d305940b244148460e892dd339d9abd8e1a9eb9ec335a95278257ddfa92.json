{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=19.5, y=-1.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore pump at position (x=19.5, y=-1.5) with status WORKING\n- Boiler at position (x=20.5, y=-4.0) with status NOT_CONNECTED\n- Steam engine at position (x=22.5, y=-7.5) with status NOT_CONNECTED\n- Pipe group connecting the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine, with various pipes at positions including (x=19.5, y=-2.5), (x=20.5, y=-4.5), and (x=22.5, y=-4.5)\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with status NO_INGREDIENTS\n- Stone furnace at position (x=2.0, y=0.0) with status NO_INGREDIENTS\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at Position (x=5.0, y=5.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace at position (x=5.0, y=5.0) with status NO_INGREDIENTS\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Small electric poles at various positions including (x=-1.5, y=0.5), (x=-3.5, y=2.5), and (x=24.5, y=-7.5)\n\n### Storage and Inserter System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest at position (x=-3.5, y=0.5)\n- Inserter at position (x=-3.5, y=1.5) with status NO_POWER\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Boiler Not Receiving Water\n- Ensure that all pipes are correctly connected between the offshore pump and the boiler. Verify that the fluid system is complete and there are no gaps or misalignments in the pipe connections.\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities on Occupied Tiles\n- Before placing an entity, check the target tile to ensure it is unoccupied. Adjust the placement position if there is an existing object in the way.\n\n### Errors with Steam Engine and Boiler Not Connected\n- Verify that the steam engine and boiler are properly connected via pipes. Ensure that the fluid system is continuous and that there are no breaks in the connection."}
