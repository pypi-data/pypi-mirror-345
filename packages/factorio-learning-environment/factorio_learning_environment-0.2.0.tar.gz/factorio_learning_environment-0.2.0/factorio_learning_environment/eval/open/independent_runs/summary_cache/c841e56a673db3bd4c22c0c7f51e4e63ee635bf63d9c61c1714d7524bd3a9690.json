{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nThis setup is designed for the extraction and smelting of iron ore into iron plates. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0), extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-14.5, -48.5) and (-15.5, -48.5) for storing extracted resources.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5) for transferring iron ore to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-14.5, -47.5) for transferring items between chests and the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-10.0, -48.0) is currently not in use due to lack of ingredients.\n\n### Storage Area\nA series of wooden chests are used for storing iron plates:\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-7.5, -48.5), (-6.5, -48.5), (-6.5, -49.5), (-5.5, -48.5), and (-4.5, -48.5) containing various quantities of iron plates.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-3.5, -48.5) is empty.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Extraction\n- **Ensure Target Availability for Extraction**: The agent frequently encountered issues with extracting iron plates from the furnace. Before attempting to extract, verify that the target entity contains the required items and that there is space in the inventory to receive them.\n\n### Inserter Blockage and Item Transfer\n- **Avoid Inserter Blockage**: The agent faced repeated blockages at inserter drop positions. To prevent this, ensure that the destination has enough space to accept items from the inserter.\n- **Correct Item Transfer**: When transferring items, ensure that the source contains the items and the destination has space to accommodate them.\n\n### Fuel Management\n- **Maintain Adequate Fuel Levels**: Ensure that all burner entities, such as drills and inserters, have sufficient fuel to operate continuously. Regularly check and refuel these entities as needed.\n\nBy addressing these errors and optimizing the current setup, the agent can improve the efficiency and productivity of the iron plate production facility."}
