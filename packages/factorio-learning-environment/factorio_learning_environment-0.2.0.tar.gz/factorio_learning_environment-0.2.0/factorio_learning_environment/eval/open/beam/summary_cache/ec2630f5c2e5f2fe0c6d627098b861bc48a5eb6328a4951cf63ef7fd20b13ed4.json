This is the most straightforward way to regain functionality.\n2. **Check for External Issues**: Ensure that there are no external factors (like system performance or resource constraints) affecting the REPL's responsiveness.\n3. **Reboot the Game**: If resetting the REPL does not work, consider restarting the entire game to clear any potential issues.\n\n### Tips for Future Interactions:\n- **Start with Simple Commands**: When the environment is responsive again, begin with basic commands to ensure everything is functioning correctly.\n- **Use Logging**: Implement logging in your scripts to capture outputs and errors, which can help diagnose issues in the future.\n- **Consult Documentation**: Always refer to the Factorio API documentation for guidance on command usage and expected behavior.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe current state of the environment is unworkable, and a reset or restart seems necessary to regain functionality.
