{"content": "The error indicates that the crafting of `Small Electric Pole` failed because wood is a raw resource that needs to be gathered manually and cannot be crafted. Let's address this by gathering wood first and then proceeding with the crafting and setup.\n\nHere's how you can adjust your approach:\n\n1. **Gather Wood**: Ensure you have enough wood in your inventory.\n2. **Craft Small Electric Poles**: Once you have wood, craft the poles.\n3. **Place Electric Poles**: Connect the assembling machine to the power network.\n\nHere's the revised plan:\n\n```python\n# Gather wood manually if not already in inventory\nwood_inventory = inspect_inventory().get(Prototype.Wood, 0)\nif wood_inventory < 10:\n    print(\"Gathering wood...\")\n    # Assuming there's a function to gather wood; if not, this needs to be done manually\n    gather_resource(Prototype.Wood, quantity=10)\n    print(\"Gathered wood for crafting.\")\n\n# Check inventory again for wood\nwood_inventory = inspect_inventory().get(Prototype.Wood, 0)\nif wood_inventory >= 10:\n    # Craft Small Electric Poles\n    craft_item(Prototype.SmallElectricPole, 5)\n    print(\"Crafted Small Electric Poles.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Insufficient wood to craft Small Electric Poles.
