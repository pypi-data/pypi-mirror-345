{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Setup\n- **Location:** Positions spanning from x=-15.0, y=-50.0 to x=-12.0, y=-48.0\n- **Components:**\n  - **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n    - **Fuel:** Coal\n    - **Status:** Working\n    - **Warnings:** Chest at drop position is full. Empty the chest at (-14.5, -48.5) to continue mining.\n  - **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n    - **Inventory:** Contains iron ore\n  - **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5)\n    - **Fuel:** Coal\n    - **Status:** Waiting for source items\n    - **Function:** Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace\n  - **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0)\n    - **Fuel:** Coal\n    - **Status:** No ingredients to smelt\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Alignment and Functionality\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items between entities. Regularly check the setup if the furnace is not receiving materials.\n\n### Errors with Full Chests\n- Monitor the inventory of chests and ensure they are not full to prevent mining operations from halting. Regularly extract items to free up space.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Not Receiving Ingredients\n- Verify the inserter's operation and ensure it is fueled and correctly positioned to deliver materials to the furnace. Check for any obstructions or misalignments that may prevent the transfer of items."}
