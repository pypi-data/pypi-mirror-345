{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nCurrently, there are no structures on the map. The agent has attempted to place various entities such as Stone Furnaces, Wooden Chests, and Transport Belts, but none have been successfully placed due to various errors or restrictions.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities in non-buildable areas\n- Ensure that the area where you intend to place an entity is buildable. Verify the buildability of the position before attempting to place entities like Stone Furnaces, Wooden Chests, and Transport Belts.\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Check that the tile where you want to place an entity is not occupied or restricted. Attempting to place entities on occupied or restricted tiles will result in placement failure.\n\n### Errors due to lack of resources for operation\n- Ensure that resources like coal are available and supplied to entities such as Furnaces for them to operate correctly. Without the necessary resources, entities cannot function as intended.\n\n### General placement errors\n- Before placing any entity, confirm that the placement is valid by checking environmental settings and restrictions. This includes ensuring that the target position is within a buildable area and not obstructed by other entities or terrain features.\n\nThese tips should help mitigate the errors encountered during entity placement and improve the efficiency of building structures in the game."}
