{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5) for coal storage.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-20.0, -70.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -70.0) with a status of no ingredients to smelt.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-18.0, -70.0) with a status of full output, connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-23.5, -69.5) for copper ore storage.\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) connected to a transport belt network and a Wooden Chest at position (-24.5, -67.5).\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Transport System at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -54.5) and a Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5).\n- Transport Belt network connecting the mining drill to the storage chest at position (-12.5, -54.5).\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with a status of full output.\n- Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5) for storing coal, iron ore, and iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) waiting for source items, connected to Wooden Chests at positions (1.5, 0.5) and (3.5, 0.5).\n\n### Belt Networks\n- Multiple belt groups connecting various entities, facilitating the movement of resources between mining drills, furnaces, and chests.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Not Working\n- Ensure that the inserter's pickup and drop positions are correctly aligned with the source and destination entities. The inserter at position (-17.5, -64.5) is not working due to misalignment or lack of source items.\n\n### Errors with Fuel Management\n- Regularly check and refuel entities such as Burner Mining Drills and Furnaces to prevent them from running out of fuel, as seen with the drill at position (53.0, -83.0) and (23.0, -68.0).\n\n### Errors with Full Output in Furnaces\n- Ensure that the output of furnaces is regularly cleared to prevent them from reaching a full output status, as seen with the furnace at position (-18.0, -70.0).\n\n### Errors with Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Verify that the inserter has access to source items and that the source container is not empty, as seen with the inserter at position (2.5, 0.5)."}
