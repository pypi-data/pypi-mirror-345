{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Boiler at position (-5.5, 24.0) with fuel inventory of 3 coal, working status.\n- Steam Engine at position (-1.5, 24.5) with energy output of 14000.0, working status.\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5) with working status.\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine, facilitating steam flow.\n\n### Research Lab at Position (6.5, -57.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab at position (6.5, -57.5) with input of 16 automation-science-packs, currently working on electronics research.\n\n### Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (6.0, -62.0) with fuel inventory of 48 coal, status indicating no ingredients to smelt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when accessing non-existent entities\n- Ensure that the entity you are trying to access exists at the specified position. For example, attempting to access a lab at position (6.0, -62.0) resulted in an error because no lab was present there. Double-check entity positions before accessing them.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
