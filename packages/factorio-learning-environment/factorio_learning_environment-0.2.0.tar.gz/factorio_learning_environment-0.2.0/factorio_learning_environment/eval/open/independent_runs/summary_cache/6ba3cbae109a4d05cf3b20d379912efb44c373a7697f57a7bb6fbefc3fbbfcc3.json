{"content": "# Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-0.5, -9.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position -0.5, -9.5), boiler (position -4.5, 23.0), and offshore pump (position -7.5, 25.5). The steam engine is currently not connected to the power network and has no input liquid, while the boiler is at full output with water and steam present.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position x1) and a furnace at position(0, 0)\n- Burner mining drill (position x2) and a furnace at position(5, 5)\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine at position(z1) and inserter at position(a) that puts into the assembling machine\n- Beltgroup (position) that connects the furnace at position y1 to the assembling machine at position(z1)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting entities\n- Ensure that the small electric pole is placed correctly and not blocked by other entities before attempting to connect it to the steam engine. \n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors with power connections\n- Verify that all power-consuming entities are connected to a power network to avoid \"no power\" errors."}
