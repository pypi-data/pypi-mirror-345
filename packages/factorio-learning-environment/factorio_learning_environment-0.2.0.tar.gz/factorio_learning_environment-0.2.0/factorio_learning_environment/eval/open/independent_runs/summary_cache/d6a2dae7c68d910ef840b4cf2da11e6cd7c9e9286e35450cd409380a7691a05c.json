{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Stone Furnace at position (1.0, 1.0)\nConsists solely of the stone furnace entity located at (1.0, 1.0) which is used for smelting both iron ore and copper ore into iron plates and copper plates respectively. It accepts fuel from coal insertions and processes ore inputs to produce metal plates that are later extracted.\n\n### Wooden Chest at position (2.5, 2.5)\nConsists of the wooden chest entity placed at (2.5, 2.5) for inventory storage and management.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 Crafting Errors Due to Unmet Prerequisites\n  - Assembling Machine crafting failed because necessary technology (automation) had not been researched. Ensure required technologies are unlocked before initiating craft commands.\n  - Lab crafting failed because required sub-ingredients (notably electronic circuits needing smelted iron plates) could not be produced. Verify that all prerequisite processes are operational and ingredients are producible.\n\n\u2022 Furnace Fuel Insertion Failures\n  - Multiple instances of coal insertion into the furnace failed due to lack of available coal in the inventory. Confirm inventory levels for necessary fuel before attempting furnace operations.\n\n\u2022 Electronic Circuit Crafting Issues\n  - Electronic circuit crafting failed initially due to insufficient iron plates, a requirement which could not be met as the item \u201ciron-plate\u201d is only producible via furnace smelting. Ensure that sufficient smelting capacity and inputs are available before crafting complex items."}
