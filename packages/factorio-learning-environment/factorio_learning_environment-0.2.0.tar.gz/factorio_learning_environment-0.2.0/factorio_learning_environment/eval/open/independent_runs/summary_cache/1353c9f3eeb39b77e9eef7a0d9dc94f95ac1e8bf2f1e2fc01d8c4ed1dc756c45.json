{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System at position(-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of offshore pump (position x=-9.5, y=-0.5), boiler (position x=-5.0, y=2.5), steam engine (position x=0.5, y=6.5), and connecting pipes. The system is fully operational with the boiler fueled with coal (86 remaining) and properly connected to both the water source and steam engine. The steam engine is working and generating electricity for the factory. Small electric poles have been placed to create a power line from the steam engine to the factory area, and a complete power network has been established.\n\n### Iron Mining and Smelting at position(19.5, 74.5)\nConsists of following entities:\n- Electric mining drill (position x=19.5, y=74.5) extracting iron ore\n- Stone furnace (position x=20.0, y=78.0) for smelting iron plates\n- Inserter (position x=19.5, y=76.5) that moves ore from drill to furnace\n- Output inserter (position x=21.5, y=78.5) that takes iron plates from furnace\n- Small electric pole (position x=21.5, y=76.5) for power\n- Transport belt (position x=22.5, y=78.5) for moving iron plates\nThe system is powered but waiting for resources to flow through the production line.\n\n### Copper Mining and Smelting at position(-49.5, 81.5)\nConsists of following entities:\n- Electric mining drill (position x=-49.5, y=81.5) extracting copper ore\n- Stone furnace (position x=-49.0, y=85.0) for smelting copper plates\n- Inserter (position x=-49.5, y=83.5) that moves ore from drill to furnace\n- Output inserter (position x=-47.5, y=85.5) that takes copper plates from furnace\n- Small electric pole (position x=-47.5, y=83.5) for power\nThe system is powered but waiting for resources to flow through the production line.\n\n### Coal Mining at position(22.0, 18.0)\nConsists of following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position x=22.0, y=18.0) extracting coal\n- Wooden chest (position x=22.5, y=19.5) for collecting coal, currently contains 458 coal\nThe drill is fueled with 12 coal and working properly.\n\n### Temporary Smelting Area at position(0.0, 140.0)\nConsists of following entities:\n- Temporary iron furnace (position x=0.0, y=140.0) with 40 iron plates in output\n- Temporary copper furnace (position x=10.0, y=140.0) with 40 copper plates in output\n- Both furnaces have coal fuel (16 each) but are not smelting due to lack of ingredients\n\n### Iron Gear Production at position(0.5, 150.5)\nConsists of following entities:\n- Assembling machine 2 (position x=0.5, y=150.5) set to craft iron gear wheels\n- Input chest (position x=-3.5, y=150.5) for iron plates\n- Input inserter (position x=-2.5, y=150.5) that moves iron from chest to belt\n- Transport belt (position x=-1.5, y=150.5) that feeds iron plates\n- Input inserter (position x=-1.5, y=149.5) that moves iron from belt to assembler\n- Output inserter (position x=3.5, y=150.5) that takes gears from assembler to belt\n- Transport belt (positions x=4.5, y=150.5 to x=6.5, y=150.5) for moving gears\nThe system is powered but lacks iron plates to begin production.\n\n### Science Pack Production at position(10.5, 150.5)\nConsists of following entities:\n- Assembling machine 2 (position x=10.5, y=150.5) set to craft automation science packs\n- Transport belt system (positions x=8.5, y=148.5 to x=8.5, y=151.5) for inputs\n- Input inserter"}
