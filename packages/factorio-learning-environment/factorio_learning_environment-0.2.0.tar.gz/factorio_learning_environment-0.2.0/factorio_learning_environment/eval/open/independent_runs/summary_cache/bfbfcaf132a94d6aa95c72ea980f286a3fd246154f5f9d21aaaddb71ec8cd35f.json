{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-15.0, -50.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Two Wooden Chests at Positions (-15.5, -48.5) and (-14.5, -48.5) for storing extracted iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at Position (-13.5, -48.5) transferring iron ore from chests to furnaces.\n- Two Stone Furnaces at Positions (-12.0, -48.0) and (-10.0, -48.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Multiple Wooden Chests for storing produced iron plates at Positions (-6.5, -49.5), (-6.5, -48.5), (-7.5, -48.5), and (-5.5, -48.5).\n- Additional Burner Inserters at Positions (-14.5, -47.5), (-8.5, -47.5), and (-11.5, -45.5) facilitating movement of resources between entities.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to lack of resources in inventory\n- Ensure you have sufficient resources in your inventory before attempting to insert items into entities.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Verify that the source entity has items available for the inserter to pick up. Ensure the supply chain is not interrupted.\n\n### Furnace Belt at Drop Position is Blocked\n- Regularly clear output slots of furnaces to prevent blockage. Ensure that the destination for inserter drop positions is not full.\n\n### Furnace Result is Full\n- Regularly extract items from the furnace output to prevent it from becoming full and halting production.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Space in Destination\n- Ensure that the destination entity has space available to receive items from the inserter. Regularly manage inventory in destination entities to avoid overflow."}
