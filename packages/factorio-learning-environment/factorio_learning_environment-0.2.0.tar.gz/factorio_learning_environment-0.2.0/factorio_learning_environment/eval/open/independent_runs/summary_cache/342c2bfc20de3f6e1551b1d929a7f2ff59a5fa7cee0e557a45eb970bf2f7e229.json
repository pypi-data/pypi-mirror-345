{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnaces**: \n  - Stone furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) with coal as fuel.\n  - Stone furnace at position (-12.0, -48.0) with iron plates as output.\n- **Inserters**:\n  - Burner inserter at position (-13.5, -47.5) transferring items between furnaces and belts.\n  - Burner inserter at position (-14.5, -45.5) transferring items between belts and chests.\n  - Burner inserter at position (-13.5, -45.5) transferring items between belts and chests.\n  - Burner inserter at position (-11.5, -45.5) transferring items between belts and chests.\n  - Burner inserter at position (-9.5, -44.5) transferring items between belts and chests.\n  - Burner inserter at position (-14.5, -43.5) transferring items between belts and chests.\n- **Chests**:\n  - Wooden chest at position (-13.5, -46.5).\n  - Wooden chest at position (-13.5, -44.5) storing iron plates.\n  - Iron chest at position (-11.5, -44.5) storing iron plates.\n  - Wooden chest at position (-9.5, -43.5) storing iron plates.\n- **Belts**:\n  - Belt group connecting various entities for item transportation.\n\n### Electricity Generator\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Offshore Pump**: Positioned at (-9.5, 24.5) supplying water.\n- **Boilers**:\n  - Boiler at position (-8.0, 0.5) with coal as fuel.\n  - Boiler at position (0.0, 0.5) without fuel.\n- **Steam Engine**: Positioned at (3.5, 0.5) not connected to the power network.\n- **Pipe Groups**:\n  - Pipe group at position (-6.5, 1.5).\n  - Pipe group at position (-4.5, 0.5).\n  - Pipe group at position (-8.5, 21.5) with water.\n\n### Electricity Network\n- **Electricity Group**: Poles positioned from (-9.5, -29.5) to (-4.5, 25.5) with voltage 0.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting pipes\n- Ensure that the pipes are correctly aligned and connected between the offshore pump and the boiler. Check for any obstructions or misalignments that might prevent a successful connection.\n\n### Errors with inserters waiting for source items\n- Verify that the inserters have access to source items and that there are no blockages preventing item transfer.\n\n### Errors with output blocked by items on the ground\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity available to accept the output from inserters to prevent blockages.\n\n### Errors with not connected to power network\n- Check that all power-producing entities are properly connected to the power network to ensure electricity flow."}
