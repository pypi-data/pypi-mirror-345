{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (x=53.0, y=-83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=53.0, y=-83.0) extracting coal, connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=52.5, y=-84.5) for storage.\n\n### Copper and Iron Ore Mining Facility at Position (x=-25.0, y=-64.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-25.0, y=-64.0) extracting copper and iron ore, connected to a transport belt system for ore movement.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage Facility at Position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0) extracting iron ore, connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-54.5) for storage.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates, currently without ingredients.\n\n### Iron Plate Transfer System at Position (x=1.5, y=0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=1.5, y=0.5) receiving iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=2.5, y=0.5) transferring iron plates between chests.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=3.5, y=0.5) supplying iron plates.\n\n### Transport Belt Systems\n- BeltGroup at positions (x=-26.5, y=-65.5) to (x=-22.5, y=-65.5) for copper ore transport.\n- BeltGroup at positions (x=-23.5, y=-64.5) to (x=-21.5, y=-64.5).\n- BeltGroup at positions (x=-20.5, y=-64.5) to (x=-20.5, y=-66.5).\n- BeltGroup at positions (x=-14.5, y=-63.5) to (x=-14.5, y=-65.5).\n- BeltGroup at positions (x=-18.5, y=-63.5) to (x=-16.5, y=-63.5).\n- BeltGroup at positions (x=-14.5, y=-54.5) to (x=-17.5, y=-59.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Operations\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt to avoid idle status. Check and supply the required resources timely.\n\n### Errors with Fuel Management\n- Regularly refuel mining drills and inserters to maintain continuous operation. Monitor fuel levels and replenish as needed to prevent stoppages."}
