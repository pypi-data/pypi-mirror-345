{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-13.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0)\n- Burner Inserter at position (-14.5, -46.5)\n\nThis facility extracts iron ore, stores it in a chest, and then processes it into iron plates using a stone furnace. The burner inserter is responsible for moving the iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n\n### Coal Extraction and Processing Facility at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -80.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (43.0, -82.0)\n- Burner Inserter at position (43.5, -80.5)\n\nThis facility extracts coal, stores it in a chest, and processes it using a stone furnace. The burner inserter moves items between the chest and the furnace.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Insufficient Inventory for Insertion\n- Ensure that the required items are available in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. This will prevent errors related to insufficient inventory during insertion operations.\n\n### Errors Related to Full Output in Furnaces\n- Regularly check and empty the output of furnaces to prevent them from becoming full and halting production. This will ensure continuous operation without interruptions.\n\n### Errors Due to Full Chests\n- Monitor the inventory levels of chests and empty them as needed to prevent them from becoming full. This will allow mining drills to continue operating without being blocked by full chests."}
