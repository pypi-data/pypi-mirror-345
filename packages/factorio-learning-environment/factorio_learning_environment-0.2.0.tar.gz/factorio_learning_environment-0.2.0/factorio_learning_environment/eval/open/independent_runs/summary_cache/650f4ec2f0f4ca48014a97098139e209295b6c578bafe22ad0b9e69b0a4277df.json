{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-46.5, -123.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-46.5, -123.5)\n- PipeGroup with fluid system 64143, starting at position (-46.5, -122.5)\n- Steam Engine at position (-40.5, -113.5)\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -76.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-15.5, -77.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -73.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (9.0, -64.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (6.0, -62.0) with an Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (6.5, -59.5)\n\n### Miscellaneous Structures\n- Wooden Chest at position (7.5, -61.5)\n- Lab with input of automation science pack at position (not specified)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities\n- Ensure you can place an entity at a target location before attempting placement. The agent encountered issues placing a boiler at positions (-42.5, -124.0) and (-42.5, -121.5) due to existing objects obstructing the placement.\n\n### Errors with Electricity Connection\n- Make sure that all electrical entities are properly connected to the power network. The steam engine at position (-40.5, -113.5) is not connected to the power network and has no input liquid, preventing it from functioning.\n\n### Errors with Resource Management\n- Regularly check and manage the inventory of chests and furnaces to ensure they have necessary resources. The burner mining drill at position (-15.0, -76.0) is out of fuel, and the chest at position (-15.5, -77.5) is full, halting further mining. Additionally, stone furnaces have no ingredients to smelt, indicating a need for better resource flow management."}
