{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n###Coal Mining and Processing Setup at (-41, -82)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0) mining coal\n- Transport belt at (41.5, -80.5) facing RIGHT\n- Burner inserter at (42.5, -80.5) facing RIGHT, picking up from belt (41.5, -80.5) and dropping at (43.5, -80.5)\n- Stone furnace at (43.0, -82.0) facing UP\n\nCurrent status: System is stalled due to blockages. Mining drill cannot output because belt is blocked, inserter cannot output due to no valid drop location, and furnace has full fuel but no ingredients.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Conflicts\n- Before placing entities, check if the target location is already occupied\n- When using place_entity_next_to(), ensure proper spacing parameter to avoid conflicts with existing entities\n- Consider the full size of entities (e.g. mining drills are 2x2) when planning placement\n\n### Belt and Inserter Flow Issues\n- Ensure complete material flow paths - every inserter needs valid pickup and drop locations\n- When placing inserters, verify both pickup and drop positions are reachable and compatible with the inserter's orientation\n- Clear blockages in transport systems before adding new components\n\n### Entity Positioning\n- When connecting entities with inserters, ensure the inserter can physically reach both the source and destination\n- Consider using place_entity_next_to() with appropriate spacing and direction parameters\n- Validate entity chains (drill \u2192 belt \u2192 inserter \u2192 furnace) have compatible positions and orientations\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nFunctions:\n- place_entity(): Places entities at specific coordinates\n- place_entity_next_to(): Places entities adjacent to existing ones with configurable spacing and direction\n\nImportant Variables:\n- None identified in provided logs\n\nThe agent appears to be experimenting with different approaches to connect a mining and processing system, with multiple attempts at repositioning components to achieve proper material flow."}
