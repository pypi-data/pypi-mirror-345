{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone mine at position(-46.0, 0.0)\nConsists of \n- Burner mining drill (position: -46.0, 0.0)\n- Wooden chest (position: -45.5, 1.5) to collect stone\n- Burner inserter (position: -46.5, 1.5) to feed stone into furnace\n- Stone furnace (position: -44.0, 2.0) to smelt stone into stone bricks\n- Wooden chest (position: -46.5, 2.5) to collect output from inserter\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n* Errors when placing entities too far away from the current position\n  - Move closer to the target position before attempting to place an entity. The maximum distance allowed is 10 units.\n* Errors due to undefined variables\n  - Ensure that all variables are defined before using them in the code. Check for typos and undefined names.\n* Errors when output is blocked\n  - Ensure that there is a sink entity in place to accept the output. Check the entity's drop position and the surrounding area.\n* Errors when entities are out of fuel\n  - Ensure that entities that require fuel have sufficient fuel to operate.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n* Important variables:\n  - `drill`: likely an entity object representing the burner mining drill (type not explicitly mentioned)\n  - `chest`: likely an entity object representing the wooden chest (type not explicitly mentioned)\n* Utility functions:\n  - `place_entity(entity: Any, direction: Any, position: Any, exact: Any) -> Any`: Places an entity at a specified position.\n    - Failure mode: Could not place entity at target position due to being too far away.\n    - Success mode: Entity is placed successfully at the target position.\n  - `get_entity(entity: Any, position: Any) -> Any`: Likely retrieves an entity at a specified position (not explicitly defined but mentioned in error message)."}
