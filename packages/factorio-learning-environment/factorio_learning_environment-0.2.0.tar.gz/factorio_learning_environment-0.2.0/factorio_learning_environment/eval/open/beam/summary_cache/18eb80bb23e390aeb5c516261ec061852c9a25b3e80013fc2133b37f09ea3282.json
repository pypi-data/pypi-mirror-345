{"content": "I notice a pattern in the errors - we're having trouble placing the burner mining drill. Let's analyze the issues:\n\n1. We can't place entities more than 10 units away from our current position\n2. We need to place the mining drill on an iron ore patch\n3. The position needs to be suitable (not blocked by other entities)\n\nLet's try a simpler approach:\n\n```python\n# First check what's around us\ncurrent_entities = get_entities()\nprint(f\"Current entities around us: {current_entities}\")\n\n# Find nearest iron ore\niron_pos = nearest(Resource.IronOre)\nprint(f\"Nearest iron ore at: {iron_pos}\")\n\n# Move closer to iron ore (within 10 units)\ntarget_pos = Position(x=-15, y=15)  # Moving closer to the iron ore area\nmove_to(target_pos)\nprint(f\"Moved to position: {target_pos}\")\n\n# Now try to place the mining drill\ndrill = place_entity(\n    Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill,\n    position=Position(x=-15, y=15)\n)\nprint(f\"Placed mining drill at: {drill.position}\")\n\n# Add fuel to the drill\ninsert_item(Prototype.Coal, drill, quantity=5)\nprint(\"Added fuel to mining drill\")\n\n# Check drill status\nprint(f\"Mining drill status: {drill.status}\")\n```\n\nThis approach:\n1. First checks what entities are already present\n2. Moves closer to the iron ore (within 10 units)\n3. Attempts to place the drill at a specific position\n4. Adds fuel and checks status\n\nLet me know if this works better, and we can then add the furnace and belt setup once we have the drill working.", "summary_range": "[1-2528]"}
