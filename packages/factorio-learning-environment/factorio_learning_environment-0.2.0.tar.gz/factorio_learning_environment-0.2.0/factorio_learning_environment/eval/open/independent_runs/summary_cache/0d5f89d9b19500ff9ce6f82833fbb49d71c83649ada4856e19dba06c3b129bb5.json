Always verify the active PipeGroup\u2019s fluid_system ID before attempting water supply connections.\n   - Earlier unsuccessful attempts with fluid_system IDs [19372, 19415, 19458, 19501, 19544, 19587, 19630, 19673] and [19716, 19759, 19802, 19845, 19888, 19931, 19974, 20017] indicate the need for consistent cross-checks of live pipeline configurations.\n   \n\u2022 Pipeline Stabilization Efficiency:\n   - Dependence on a fixed 10-second delay for pipeline stabilization has repeatedly resulted in unsuccessful connection attempts. Incorporate dynamic checks for pipeline readiness to ensure proper connections."}
