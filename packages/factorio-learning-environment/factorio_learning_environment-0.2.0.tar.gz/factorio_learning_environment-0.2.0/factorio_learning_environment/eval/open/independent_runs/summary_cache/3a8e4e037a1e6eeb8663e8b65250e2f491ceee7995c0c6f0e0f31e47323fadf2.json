{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) extracting iron ore, with nearby **wooden chests** at positions (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) and (x=-15.5, y=-48.5) for storage.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) transferring iron ore from the chest to the **stone furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0).\n- **Stone Furnace 1** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Stone Furnace 2** at position (x=-10.0, y=-48.0) also used for smelting, currently without ingredients.\n- **Burner Inserters** at positions (x=-14.5, y=-47.5), (x=-11.5, y=-46.5), (x=-8.5, y=-47.5), and (x=-11.5, y=-45.5) managing the transfer of materials between entities.\n- Multiple **wooden chests** at various positions storing iron plates and iron ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Blockage at Inserter Drop Position\n- Ensure that the destination for inserters is clear before attempting to drop items. Regularly check and clear any blockages.\n\n### Extraction Errors from Furnace\n- Verify that the furnace contains the items you wish to extract. Ensure the correct quantity is specified and that the furnace is accessible.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source from which the inserter is picking up items is not empty. Regularly supply the source with necessary materials.\n\n### Furnace Without Ingredients\n- Regularly supply furnaces with the necessary ingredients to prevent downtime. Ensure a steady flow of raw materials to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Fuel Management\n- Regularly refuel drills, furnaces, and inserters to maintain continuous operation. Monitor fuel levels and replenish as needed to avoid interruptions."}
