{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll generate a comprehensive report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing System (around y=-80)\nComplex smelting setup consisting of:\n- Input chest at (45.5, -79.5) containing iron ore\n- Two stone furnaces at (45.0, -81.0) and (47.0, -81.0)\n- Output chest at (49.5, -80.5) storing iron plates\n- Two burner inserters at (44.5, -79.5) and (46.5, -79.5)\nSystem is set up but experiencing placement and configuration issues\n\n### Coal Mining Operation (around y=-82)\nAutomated coal mining system consisting of:\n- Burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0) mining coal\n- Multiple storage chests:\n  - Two iron chests at (41.5, -84.5) and (41.5, -83.5) storing coal (1600 each)\n  - Wooden chest at (41.5, -80.5) storing coal (800)\n- Additional wooden chest at (45.5, -84.5) currently empty\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Conflicts\n- Before placing inserters or other entities, verify the target position is clear of other objects\n- Multiple failed attempts to place burner-inserters at occupied positions (45.5, -80.5), (45.0, -80.0)\n- Consider checking entity dimensions and required clearance before placement\n\n### Resource Management Issues\n- Coal mining system is stalled due to full output chests\n- Implement a system to manage chest contents before they become full\n- Consider adding overflow protection or automatic resource distribution\n\n### Furnace Efficiency\n- Furnaces have fuel but no ingredients to smelt\n- Ensure proper input/output coordination between chests, inserters, and furnaces\n- Verify inserter pickup and drop positions align with intended material flow\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nFunctions:\n- place_entity(): Places entities on the map, requires clear placement area\n- rotate_inserter(): Changes inserter facing direction\n\nImportant Variables:\n- first_inserter: Entity (burner-inserter)\n- second_inserter: Entity (burner-inserter)\n- furnace_source: Inventory\n- furnace_result: Inventory"}
