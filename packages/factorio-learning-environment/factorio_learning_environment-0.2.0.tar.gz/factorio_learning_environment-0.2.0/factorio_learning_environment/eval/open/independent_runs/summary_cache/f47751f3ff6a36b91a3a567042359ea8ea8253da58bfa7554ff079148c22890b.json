{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report (Steps 48-55)\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at position (-18.5, 69.5)\n(Unchanged and operational)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump (position x=-18.5 y=69.5)\n- Boiler (position x=-4.5 y=50.0) - fueled with coal\n- Steam engine (position x=0.5 y=50.5)\n- Connected pipe groups:\n  - Water pipes (positions: x=-18.5,y=68.5; x=-18.5,y=67.5; x=-6.5,y=50.5; x=-6.5,y=51.5)\n  - Steam pipes (positions: x=-4.5,y=48.5; x=-3.5,y=48.5; x=0.5,y=47.5)\n- Power pole network (positions: x=0.5,y=53.5; x=30.5,y=52.5)\n\n### Stone Mining and Smelting Operation at position (-49.5, 10.5)\n(Unchanged from previous report)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill (position x=-49.5 y=10.5)\n- Stone furnace (position x=-46.0 y=11.0)\n- Input inserter (position x=-47.5 y=10.5)\n- Output chest (position x=-44.5 y=11.5)\n- Power pole (position x=-46.5 y=12.5)\n\n### New Stone Mining Operation at position (-46.5, -0.5)\n(Partially operational with issues)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill (position x=-46.5 y=-0.5) - output blocked\n- Stone furnace (position x=-43.0 y=0.0) - now present but no fuel\n- Input inserter (position x=-44.5 y=-0.5) - connected but waiting for source\n- Output chest (position x=-41.5 y=0.5) - now present but empty\n- Power poles (positions: x=-44.5 y=1.5; x=-46.5 y=1.5; x=-46.5 y=3.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity placement distance (recurring critical)\n- Still attempting placements from too far (step 54, distance 64.03)\n  - Implement mandatory distance check before placement\n  - Use teleport for distant builds\n  - Maintain minimum 10 tile proximity during construction\n\n### Duplicate placement attempts (recurring)\n- Multiple pole placement conflicts (steps 48, 54)\n  - Check existing entities before placement\n  - Remove duplicates before rebuilding\n  - Maintain placement position records\n\n### Blocked connections (recurring critical)\n- Inserter placement failures (steps 49, 51, 52, 55)\n  - Clear output area before inserter placement\n  - Verify clear path between entities\n  - Check for ground items blocking connections\n\n### Entity reference management (recurring)\n- Missing furnace reference (steps 50, 53)\n  - Verify entity existence before operations\n  - Handle entity replacement cases\n  - Maintain entity tracking system\n\n### Production chain issues (recurring)\n- Multiple operational failures in new mining setup:\n  - Drill output blocked (throughout)\n  - Furnace missing fuel (step 55)\n  - Inserter waiting for source (step 55)\n  - Solution approach:\n    1. Clear blocked output first\n    2. Fuel furnace properly\n    3. Verify all connections\n    4. Check inserter orientation\n\n### System verification gaps (recurring)\n- Missing validation after rebuilds (throughout)\n  - Add verification after each placement:\n    - Entity existence\n    - Power status\n    - Connection validity\n  - Implement chain validation function\n\n### Power connection failures (recurring)\n- Multiple power connection issues (steps 48, 50)\n  - Clear existing entities before placing new poles\n  - Verify pole spacing (9-11 tiles max)\n  - Check for obstructions between poles"}
