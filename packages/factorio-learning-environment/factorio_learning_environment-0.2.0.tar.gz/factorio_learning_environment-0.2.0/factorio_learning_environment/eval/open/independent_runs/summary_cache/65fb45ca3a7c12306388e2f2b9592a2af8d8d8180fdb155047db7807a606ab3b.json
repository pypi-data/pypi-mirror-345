{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Iron Plate Production Line at y=1.0\nConsists of two stone furnaces working in parallel with automated output collection:\n- Stone furnace at position (1.0, 1.0) - actively smelting iron ore with coal as fuel\n- Stone furnace at position (3.0, 1.0) - actively smelting iron ore with coal as fuel\n- Burner inserter at position (1.5, 2.5) - configured to extract from first furnace\n- Burner inserter at position (3.5, 2.5) - configured to extract from second furnace\n- Collection chest at position (1.5, 3.5) - collecting iron plates from first furnace\n- Collection chest at position (3.5, 3.5) - collecting iron plates from second furnace\n\nCurrent status:\n- First furnace: 30 coal, 5 iron ore, 12 iron plates\n- Second furnace: 41 coal, 4 iron ore, 6 iron plates\n- Both inserters have 19 coal each and are now working properly\n- First collection chest contains 31 iron plates\n- Second collection chest contains 30 iron plates\n\nERROR TIPS\n### Errors when placing entities without required items\n- Check inventory before attempting to place entities\n- Ensure you have crafted or collected the required items before placement\n- Recent example: Attempted to place stone furnace without having any in inventory\n\n### Errors when placing entities in invalid locations\n- Verify the target location is valid before placing entities\n- Some locations may be blocked by other entities or terrain\n- Consider checking if the target position overlaps with existing structures\n- Use appropriate spacing between entities to avoid placement conflicts\n\n### Errors with resource management\n- Keep track of resource quantities in inventory\n- Ensure sufficient resources are collected before attempting to supply multiple machines\n- Consider collecting additional resources when inventory runs low on critical items\n- Craft required building components before starting new construction projects"}
