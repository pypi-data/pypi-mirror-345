{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (x=41.0, y=-82.0)\nThis facility is responsible for producing iron plates. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0), which extracts resources and drops them into a connected chest.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=43.0, y=-82.0), which smelts the extracted iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Iron Chest** at position (x=41.5, y=-80.5), which stores coal and serves as an intermediary storage for the extracted resources.\n- **Burner Inserters** at positions (x=40.5, y=-80.5), (x=42.5, y=-80.5), and (x=43.5, y=-80.5), which transfer resources between the chest, mining drill, and furnace.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=41.5, y=-79.5), which stores additional coal.\n  \n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility at Position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\nThis facility is responsible for mining iron ore and smelting it into iron plates. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0), which extracts iron ore and drops it into a connected chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5), which stores the extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-15.5, y=-48.5), which transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (x=-13.0, y=-48.0), (x=-11.0, y=-48.0), and (x=-9.0, y=-48.0), which smelt the iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Additional Wooden Chests** at positions (x=-12.5, y=-49.5) and (x=-9.5, y=-49.5), which store iron ore and iron plates.\n- **Iron Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5), which serves as an intermediary storage.\n- **Burner Inserters** at positions (x=-14.5, y=-46.5) and (x=-14.5, y=-45.5), which facilitate the transfer of resources between entities.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors When Extracting Resources\n- Ensure you are within range of the target entity (e.g., ore chest, coal chest) before attempting to extract resources. This will prevent extraction failures.\n\n### Errors When Transferring Resources to Furnaces\n- Verify that the furnaces are within range and have available space for the resources you are attempting to transfer. This will prevent transfer failures.\n\n### Errors Due to Full Storage\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are full to ensure continuous operation of mining drills and inserters. Full chests can halt production processes.\n\n### Errors When Moving Items to New Storage\n- Confirm that the destination storage has enough space to accommodate the items being moved. This will prevent movement failures."}
