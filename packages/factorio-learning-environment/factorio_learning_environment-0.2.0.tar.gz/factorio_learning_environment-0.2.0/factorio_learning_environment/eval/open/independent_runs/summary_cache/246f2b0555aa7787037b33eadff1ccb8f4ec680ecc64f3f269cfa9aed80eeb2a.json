{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=4.0, y=-60.0) with a drop position at (x=4.5, y=-58.5), connected to a wooden chest at (x=4.5, y=-58.5).\n- Wooden chests for storage at positions:\n  - (x=5.5, y=-60.5)\n  - (x=7.5, y=-60.5)\n  - (x=6.5, y=-60.5)\n  - (x=9.5, y=-60.5)\n  - (x=8.5, y=-60.5)\n  - (x=4.5, y=-58.5) containing iron ore.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnaces at positions:\n  - (x=-15.0, y=-48.0) with a source inventory of iron ore and a result inventory of iron plates.\n  - (x=-13.0, y=-48.0) with a source inventory of iron ore and a result inventory of iron plates.\n  - (x=-11.0, y=-48.0) with a source inventory of iron ore and a result inventory of iron plates.\n- Wooden chests for storing iron plates at positions:\n  - (x=-14.5, y=-50.5)\n  - (x=-13.5, y=-50.5)\n  - (x=-12.5, y=-50.5)\n  - (x=-11.5, y=-50.5) containing iron plates.\n  - (x=-10.5, y=-50.5) containing iron plates.\n  - (x=-9.5, y=-50.5) containing iron plates.\n  - (x=-8.5, y=-50.5) containing iron plates.\n  - (x=-7.5, y=-50.5) containing iron plates.\n  - (x=-6.5, y=-50.5)\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors when inserting items without sufficient inventory\n- Ensure that the items you intend to insert are available in your inventory before attempting to insert them into an entity. For example, attempting to insert coal without having it in your inventory will result in an error.\n\n### Errors related to full chests\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are full to avoid interruptions in mining operations. For instance, the chest at (4.5, y=-58.5) needs to be emptied to continue mining.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- No utility functions or important variables were defined or invoked in the provided steps."}
