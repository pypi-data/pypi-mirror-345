{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0) with fuel inventory containing coal and producing iron ore. It is currently working but has a warning about the output being blocked by an item on the ground. The drop position is at (x=-16.5, y=-52.5).\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0) with fuel inventory containing coal and currently having no ingredients to smelt. The furnace has a result inventory containing iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied or invalid locations\n- Ensure that the desired location for placing entities such as Wooden Chests, Burner Inserters, Stone Furnaces, and Transport Belts is not occupied by another entity or is otherwise invalid. Check the surroundings and clear any obstructions before placement.\n\n### Errors when moving entities to occupied or invalid locations\n- Before attempting to move entities like Stone Furnaces, verify that the target location is clear and suitable for placement. This will prevent errors related to moving entities to invalid positions.\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities from specific positions\n- When using API functions like `get_entity`, ensure that the specified position contains the expected entity type. Double-check the coordinates and entity type to avoid retrieval errors.\n\n### Errors related to blocked outputs\n- Address warnings about blocked outputs by ensuring that there is a sink entity in place to accept the output from production entities like Burner Mining Drills. This will prevent production halts due to blocked outputs.\n\n### Errors due to missing ingredients in production entities\n- Ensure that production entities like Stone Furnaces have the necessary ingredients to operate. Regularly supply the required resources to maintain continuous production."}
