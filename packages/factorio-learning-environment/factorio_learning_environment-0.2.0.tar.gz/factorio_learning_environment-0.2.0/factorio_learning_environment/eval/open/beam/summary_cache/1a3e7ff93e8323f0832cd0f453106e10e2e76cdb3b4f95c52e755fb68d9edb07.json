{"content": "The latest attempt to insert Copper Ore into the newly built active furnace has failed due to the furnace already containing stone. This indicates that the furnace is still not configured correctly to process the materials.\n\n### New Active Furnace Status:\n- The active furnace currently holds **1 piece of stone** and **5 pieces of coal**.\n- The furnace status is **\"NO INGREDIENTS\"**, meaning it cannot process anything due to the presence of stone.\n\n### Overall Inventory Overview:\n- **Current Inventory**:\n  - 5 pieces of stone furnaces (including the newly built one)\n  - 9 pieces of coal remaining\n  - **5 pieces of iron ore** available.\n  - **1 piece of copper ore** available.\n  - **21 pieces of iron plates** available.\n\n### Observations:\n- The furnace is unable to process the Copper Ore because it has not been cleared of the stone.\n- The previous interactions have led to a situation where the furnace is stalled.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Extract Stone from the Furnace**: I will need to remove the stone currently in the furnace to allow for the insertion of Copper Ore.\n2. **Reinsert Copper Ore**: After clearing the stone, I will attempt to insert the Copper Ore again.\n3. **Monitor Furnace Activation**: Finally, I will check if the furnace begins processing after the necessary materials are loaded.\n\nLet's proceed by extracting the stone from the active furnace. \n\"\"\"\n\n# Attempt to extract the stone from the active furnace\nextract_item(Prototype.Stone, new_active_furnace, quantity=1)  # Attempting to extract the piece of stone currently in the active furnace\n\n# Check the inventory status of the furnace after extraction\nnew_active_furnace_status_after_extraction = inspect_inventory(new_active_furnace)  # Inspect the status after extraction\noverall_inventory_after_extraction = inspect_inventory()  # Check total inventory after extraction.\n\nprint(f\"New Active Furnace inventory status after extracting stone: {new_active_furnace_status_after_extraction}\")  # Status of the furnace after extraction.\nprint(f\"Overall current inventory after extracting stone: {overall_inventory_after_extraction}\")  # Total after operations.\nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")  # Review entities displayed on the map.", "summary_range": "[1-374]"}
