{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (2 units)\n  - Status: Waiting for space in destination\n  - Warnings: Output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Drop position: (x=-16.5, y=-52.5)\n  - Resources: Iron ore (39,999 units)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (11 units)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Furnace Source: Iron ore (7 units)\n  - Furnace Result: Iron plate (97 units)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied locations\n- Ensure that the desired location is free of other entities before attempting to place a new entity such as a Wooden Chest, Burner Inserter, Transport Belt, or Stone Furnace.\n\n### Errors when moving entities to occupied locations\n- Verify that the target location is unoccupied before attempting to move entities like Stone Furnaces.\n\n### Errors retrieving entities at incorrect positions\n- Double-check the position coordinates when using functions like `get_entity` to ensure the entity exists at the specified location. This will prevent errors such as \"No entity of type stone-furnace found at the specified position.\"\n\n### Errors with incorrect API usage\n- Ensure that function calls are made with the correct arguments. For example, the `pickup_entity` function does not accept a 'quantity' keyword argument.\n\n### Errors with mismatched data types\n- When inserting items into entities, ensure that the data types of all arguments are correct. For instance, avoid passing a boolean where a number is expected, as seen in the error during ore insertion."}
