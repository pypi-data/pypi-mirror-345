{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production at (-18.0, -53.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-18.0, -53.0) with drop position (-17.5, -51.5)\n- Drill contains 6 coal\n- System status: drill waiting for space in destination\n\n### Copper Plate Production at (-21.0, -73.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-21.0, -73.0) with drop position (-20.5, -71.5)\n- Burner inserter at (-18.5, -70.5) facing LEFT with 4 coal\n- Drill contains 5 coal\n- System status: drill waiting for space in destination, inserter waiting for source items\n\n### Power Generation System\nConsists of:\n- Steam engine at (-14.5, 15.5) facing UP\n- Boiler at (-14.5, 19.0) containing 10 coal\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Multiple pipe groups connecting components\n- Electric pole network connecting broader system\nSystem status:\n- Fully operational with water and steam flowing\n- Boiler at full output capacity\n- Steam engine generating power\n\n### Research Facility\n- Lab at (10.5, 0.5) containing 13 automation science packs\n- Currently researching logistics technology\n- Connected to power network\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Recipe and Crafting Issues\n- Even after research is completed, recipes need to be enabled before crafting\n- Common failing recipes: wooden chest, stone furnace, iron chest, automation science pack\n- Check if recipe is enabled before attempting to craft\n\n### Entity Placement Issues\n- Verify you have the required item in inventory before placement (iron chest, wooden chest, stone furnace)\n- When placing entities at drill output positions, ensure proper spacing\n\n### Resource Management\n- Monitor coal levels in all fuel-consuming entities (boiler, drills, inserters)\n- Maintain sufficient wood supply when planning to craft wooden chests\n- Keep track of stone reserves when planning to craft furnaces\n\n### Entity Extraction Issues\n- When extracting from drills, ensure the entity actually contains the target resource\n- Verify correct position when attempting to extract items\n- Check if the target entity exists before attempting to pick it up\n\n### API Usage Issues\n- Handle nil values appropriately in recipe and crafting operations\n- Use correct entity class references (e.g., 'Furnace' vs 'factorio_entities.Furnace')\n- Verify entity existence before attempting operations\n\n### Automation Setup Issues\n- Address \"waiting for space in destination\" warnings with proper output handling\n- Plan chest and inserter placement carefully to avoid blocking issues\n- Ensure proper connection between automated components\n\n### Research Management\n- Verify research prerequisites before starting new research\n- Check if technology is already researched before attempting to research again\n- Ensure proper science pack supply for ongoing research"}
