Repeated attempts were made to create and place a Lab at (0.5, 2.5) for supplying Automation Science Packs, but all such actions failed due to inventory and crafting shortages. Although the agent interacted with two furnaces \u2013 an iron furnace at Position(5.0, 5.0) and a copper furnace at Position(\u201327.0, \u201360.0) used for smelting operations \u2013 these were not built by the agent and remain part of the existing map assets.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 API Usage for get_entities:\n  \u2013 Avoid passing unsupported parameters. The errors \u201cgot an unexpected keyword argument 'radius'\u201d and \u201ctakes 0 positional arguments but 3 were given\u201d indicate that the function was called with an incorrect signature. Verify and adhere to the defined API parameters.\n\n\u2022 Lab Placement Failures:\n  \u2013 The attempts to place a Lab at (0.5, 2.5) failed due to a lack of lab items in inventory. Confirm that the required lab item is available before attempting placement.\n\n\u2022 Lab Crafting Resource Shortages:\n  \u2013 Multiple lab crafting errors are due to insufficient intermediate ingredients (such as iron-gear-wheel, electronic-circuit, and copper-cable) caused by gaps in the production chain. Ensure that all prerequisite resources and production processes (like smelting and intermediate crafting) are operational and sufficiently stocked before initiating lab crafting.\n\n\u2022 Handling NoneType in Entity Retrieval:\n  \u2013 An error occurred when iterating over a None value (e.g. \u201cNoneType object is not iterable\u201d). Implement checks or fallback logic (for example, converting a None result to an empty list) when retrieving entities to avoid such type errors."}
