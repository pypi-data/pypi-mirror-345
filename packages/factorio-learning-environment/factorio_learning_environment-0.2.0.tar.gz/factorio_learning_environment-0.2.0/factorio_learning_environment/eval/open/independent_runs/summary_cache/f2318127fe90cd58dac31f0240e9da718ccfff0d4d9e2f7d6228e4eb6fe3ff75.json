{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing Facility at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (41.0, -82.0) with status `NO_FUEL`, connected to:\n  - **Stone Furnace** at position (43.0, -82.0) with status `NO_INGREDIENTS`, fueled with coal.\n  - **Wooden Chest** at position (41.5, -80.5) containing 16 units of coal.\n  - **Burner Inserter** at position (43.5, -80.5) waiting for source items, transferring items from the chest to the furnace.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) with status `WORKING`, fueled with coal, connected to:\n  - **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5) for collecting iron ore.\n  - **Stone Furnace** at position (-13.0, -48.0) with status `NO_INGREDIENTS`, fueled with coal.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities without Inventory\n- Ensure you have the required entity in your inventory before attempting to place it. For example, ensure you have a transport belt or a burner mining drill before placing them.\n\n### Errors when Crafting without Required Ingredients\n- Verify that all required ingredients are available in your inventory before crafting an item. For instance, ensure you have iron plates and iron gear wheels for crafting a burner mining drill, and wood for crafting a wooden chest.\n\n### Errors when Attempting to Insert Items without Inventory\n- Ensure you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity, such as inserting iron ore into a furnace.\n\n### Errors due to Missing Recipes for Raw Resources\n- Remember that some resources like stone and wood must be gathered directly from the environment, as they do not have crafting recipes. Gather these raw resources before attempting to craft items that require them.\n\n### Errors due to Full Inventory or Drop Positions\n- Regularly check and empty chests at drop positions to prevent mining drills from stopping due to full inventories."}
