{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(52.5, 51.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam engine (position 52.5, 51.5)\n- Boiler (position not specified)\n- Offshore pump (position not specified)\n\n### Electric pole network\nConsists of:\n- Electric pole (position 30.253846153846155, 31.423076923076923)\n- Additional electric poles planned at positions (52.5, 49.0) and (52.5, 54.0) but not successfully placed due to terrain issues.\n\n### Copper plate factory\nConsists of:\n- Furnace (position 1.0, 1.0)\n- Burner inserter (position 8.5, 1.5)\n- Chest (position 3.5, 1.5)\n- Chest (position 3.5, 3.5)\n- Chest (position 3.5, 5.5)\n- Additional furnace (position 10.0, 1.0)\n\n### Pipe network\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump (position -9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe group (position not specified)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing electric poles\n- Ensure that the target location for placing electric poles is free of obstructions. The current locations (52.5, 49.0) and (52.5, 54.0) are blocked by entities or terrain. \n\n### Errors when inserting coal into steam engine\n- Make sure that there is a nearby entity that can accept coal before attempting to insert it into the steam engine. The steam engine currently cannot accept coal due to the absence of a nearby inserter or other mechanism.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items. \n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing. \n\n### General tips\n- Regularly check the map for the status of entities and their connections to avoid issues with placement and resource insertion."}
