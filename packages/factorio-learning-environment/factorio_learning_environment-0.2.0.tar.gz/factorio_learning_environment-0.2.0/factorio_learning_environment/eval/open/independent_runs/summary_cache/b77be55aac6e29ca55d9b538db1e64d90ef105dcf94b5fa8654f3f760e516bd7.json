{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Three stone furnaces at positions:\n  - Furnace at position (-15.0, -48.0) with coal fuel and producing iron plates.\n  - Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0) with coal fuel and producing iron plates.\n  - Furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0) with coal fuel and producing iron plates.\n- A burner mining drill at position (4.0, -60.0) extracting iron ore and depositing into a chest at position (4.5, -58.5).\n\n### Storage Area\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Multiple wooden chests at various positions for storing iron plates and other resources:\n  - Chest at position (4.5, -58.5) containing iron ore.\n  - Chests at positions (-14.5, -50.5), (-13.5, -50.5), (-12.5, -50.5), (-11.5, -50.5), (-10.5, -50.5), (-9.5, -50.5), (-8.5, -50.5), (-7.5, -50.5), (-6.5, -50.5), and (-5.5, -50.5) containing iron plates.\n- An iron chest at position (-5.5, -50.5) containing iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Full Inventory\n- Ensure to regularly empty chests that are full to prevent mining operations from halting. For example, the chest at position (4.5, -58.5) is full, causing the burner mining drill to stop working.\n\n### Errors due to No Ingredients in Furnaces\n- Ensure that furnaces have a continuous supply of raw materials to avoid downtime. The furnaces at positions (-15.0, -48.0), (-13.0, -48.0), and (-11.0, -48.0) frequently report \"no ingredients to smelt.\"\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided logs.\n- Important variables:\n  - `iron_ore_chest_position`: Position of the chest containing iron ore (type: Position).\n  - `furnace_positions`: List of positions for the furnaces (type: List[Position]).\n  - `iron_plate_inventory`: Total count of iron plates in inventory (type: int)."}
