{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Automation Science Pack Production Line at position(8.5, 13.5)\nConsists of following entities:\n- Assembling machine-1 at position(8.5, 13.5)\n- Output inserter (burner-inserter) at position(10.5, 13.5)\n- Output wooden chest at position(11.5, 13.5)\n- Iron gear input inserter at position(7.5, 16.5)\n- Iron gear chest at position(7.5, 17.5)\n- Transport belt system from position(8.5, 11.5) to position(1.5, 14.5)\n\n### Power Generation System at position(-4.5, 12.5)\nConsists of following entities:\n- Steam engine at position(-4.5, 12.5)\n- Boiler at position(-4.5, 16.0)\n- Offshore pump at position(-3.5, 27.5)\n- Multiple pipe groups connecting water and steam\n- Electric pole network spanning from (4.5, 7.5) to (8.5, 15.5)\n\n### Mining and Smelting Operations\nMultiple mining and smelting setups at various locations:\n1. Setup at (-28.0, -61.0):\n   - Burner mining drill\n   - Wooden chest at (-27.5, -59.5)\n   - Burner inserter at (-26.5, -59.5)\n   - Stone furnace at (-25.0, -59.0)\n   - Output chest at (-22.5, -58.5)\n\n2. Setup at (-18.0, -53.0):\n   - Burner mining drill\n   - Wooden chest at (-17.5, -51.5)\n   - Burner inserter at (-16.5, -51.5)\n   - Stone furnace at (-15.0, -51.0)\n   - Output chest at (-12.5, -50.5)\n\n3. Setup at (41.0, -82.0):\n   - Burner mining drill\n   - Wooden chest at (41.5, -80.5)\n   - Burner inserter at (41.5, -79.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Conflicts\n- When placing inserters or chests, ensure there are no existing entities (like transport belts) at the target position\n- Check for entity collisions before placement, especially near furnaces and other large structures\n- Consider different directions or increased spacing when initial placement fails\n\n### Direction Related Errors\n- NORTHWEST is not a valid direction - use only the basic directions (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT)\n- Ensure proper direction alignment when placing inserters relative to other entities\n\n### Resource Management\n- Verify required items are in inventory before attempting to insert them into chests\n- Ensure proper fuel supply for burner entities to prevent \"out of fuel\" warnings\n\n### Structure Planning\n- Plan the layout of production lines considering the space needed for all components (inserters, chests, belts)\n- Leave adequate spacing between different production setups to avoid placement conflicts\n- Consider the flow direction of materials when placing inserters and belts"}
