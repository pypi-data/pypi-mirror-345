{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) with fuel inventory of coal, extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-14.5, -48.5) and (-15.5, -48.5) for storing extracted materials.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5) transferring iron ore to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserters** at positions (-14.5, -47.5) and (-11.5, -46.5) managing the flow of materials into and out of the furnace.\n- **Additional Stone Furnace** at position (-10.0, -48.0) currently inactive due to lack of ingredients.\n\n### Storage and Distribution System\n- **Multiple Wooden Chests** at positions (-7.5, -48.5), (-6.5, -48.5), (-6.5, -49.5), (-4.5, -48.5), (-5.5, -48.5), and (-3.5, -48.5) for storing iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-8.5, -47.5) managing the transfer of materials between chests and furnaces.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Extracting Items\n- Ensure that the target entity has enough items to extract before attempting extraction. Verify the inventory of the entity to prevent extraction errors.\n\n### Errors due to Inserter Blockage\n- Regularly check and clear the drop position of inserters to prevent blockages. Ensure there is enough space for items to be placed.\n\n### Errors when Inserting Items\n- Verify that the inventory has the required items before attempting to insert them into another entity. This will prevent insertion errors due to lack of items.\n\n### General Tips for Continuous Operation\n- Monitor fuel levels in all burner entities to ensure continuous operation.\n- Regularly check the status of all entities to address any warnings or errors promptly."}
