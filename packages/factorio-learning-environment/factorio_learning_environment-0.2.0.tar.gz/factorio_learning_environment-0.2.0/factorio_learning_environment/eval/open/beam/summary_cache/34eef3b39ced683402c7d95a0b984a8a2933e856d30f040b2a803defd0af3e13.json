{"content": "The error suggests that the furnace is still considered full despite attempts to clear it. This might be due to incorrect assumptions about the furnace's state or its position. Let's address this by ensuring we correctly identify the furnace's state and position:\n\n1. **Verify Furnace Position**: Ensure that the furnace's position is correctly specified and that the furnace is actually present at that location.\n\n2. **Debugging Output**: Add more detailed debugging output to understand what's happening with the furnace's inventory.\n\n3. **Check Inventory Types**: Ensure that we're checking and clearing the correct inventory slots.\n\nHere's the revised approach:\n\n```python\ndef confirm_and_initialize_furnace(furnace_position: Position):\n    \"\"\"\n    Ensures the furnace exists at the specified position.\n    \"\"\"\n    potential_furnaces = get_entities({Prototype.StoneFurnace}, furnace_position, radius=1)\n    if potential_furnaces:\n        return potential_furnaces[0]\n    else:\n        print(\"No furnace found at the expected position.\")\n        raise ValueError('Expected Stone Furnace not present at the specified position.')\n\ndef clear_furnace(furnace):\n    \"\"\"\n    Clears the furnace's inventory by extracting all available items.\n    \"\"\"\n    output_inventory = inspect_inventory(furnace)\n    print(f\"Clearing furnace, current contents: {output_inventory}\")\n    for item_name, quantity in output_inventory.items():\n        if quantity > 0:\n            item_prototype = prototype_by_name[item_name]\n            extract_item(item_prototype, furnace.position, quantity)\n\ndef ensure_coal_inserted(furnace):\n    \"\"\"\n    Ensures fuel is inserted into the furnace by clearing slots if necessary.\n    \"\"\"\n    max_attempts = 5\n    for attempt in range(max_attempts):\n        coal_count = inspect_inventory(furnace).get(Prototype.Coal, 0)\n        print(f\"Attempt {attempt + 1}: Coal count in furnace: {coal_count}\")\n        if coal_count < 5:\n            succeeded = insert_item(Prototype.Coal, furnace, quantity=5)\n            if succeeded:\n                print(\"Coal successfully inserted.\")\n                return\n            else:\n                print(f\"Insertion failed on attempt {attempt + 1}; clearing furnace and retrying.\")\n                clear_furnace(furnace)\n        else:\n            break\n    else:\n        print(\"Failed to insert coal after multiple attempts.\")\n        raise Exception(\"InsertionRetryFailed\")\n\ndef smelt_ore(resource: Resource, quantity: int):\n    \"\"\"\n    Smelts a specified amount of ore into plates, handling full inventories.\n    \"\"\"\n    furnace_position = Position(x=0.0, y=0.0)  # Ensure this is the correct position\n    furnace = confirm_and_initialize_furnace(furnace_position)\n\n    # Clear output slots first\n    clear_furnace(furnace)\n\n    # Insert fuel - ensures a retry/clear mechanism\n    ensure_coal_inserted(furnace)\n\n    # Attempt repeated ore insertion until successful\n    ore_prototype = prototype_by_name[resource.name.lower()]\n    while not insert_item(ore_prototype, furnace, quantity=quantity):\n        print(\"Ore insertion failed; clearing furnace and retrying.\")\n        clear_furnace(furnace)\n\n    # Wait until required plates have been smelted\n    plate_prototype = resource_to_plate_map.get(resource)\n    if not plate_prototype:\n        raise ValueError(f\"Resource {resource} is not correctly mapped to a plate type.\")\n\n    while inspect_inventory(furnace).get(plate_prototype, 0) < quantity:\n        sleep(1)\n\ndef gather_raw_materials():\n    \"\"\"\n    Collect copper ore and smelt it into copper plates.\n    \"\"\"\n    copper_amount_needed = 10\n    move_to(nearest(Resource.CopperOre))\n    current_copper_ore = inspect_inventory().get(Prototype.CopperOre, 0)\n    \n    if current_copper_ore < copper_amount_needed:\n        missing_amount = copper_amount_needed - current_copper_ore\n        harvest_resource(nearest(Resource.CopperOre), quantity=missing_amount)\n    \n    smelt_ore(Resource.CopperOre, copper_amount_needed)\n\ndef ensure_offshore_pump_available():\n    \"\"\"\n    Ensure all components for crafting the Offshore Pump are available.\n    \"\"\"\n    electronics_needed = 5\n    current_electronics = inspect_inventory().get(Prototype.ElectronicCircuit, 0)\n    \n    if current_electronics < electronics_needed:\n        copper_cables_needed = 15\n        insertion_iron_plate = 5\n\n        # Gather materials for circuits\n        move_to(Position(x=0.0, y=0.0))\n        current_copper_plates = inspect_inventory().get(Prototype.CopperPlate, 0)\n        additional_copper_required = copper_cables_needed - current_copper_plates\n        if additional_copper_required > 0:\n            smelt_ore(Resource.CopperOre, additional_copper_required)\n        \n", "summary_range": "[1-364]"}
