It should be two positions and a prototype.\n\n### Errors when using connect_entities but given positions are floats\n-  Make sure to convert the positions to integers before passing them to the connect_entities function.\n\n### Errors when using connect_entities but positions do not have a 'position' attribute\n-  Make sure that the positions passed to the connect_entities function have a 'position' attribute. If not, access the position directly.\n\n### NAMESPACE\nNo utility functions have been defined by the agent.\nImportant variables that have been assigned:\n- offshore_pump: an OffshorePump entity\n- boiler: a Boiler entity\n- Prototype.Pipe: a prototype for a pipe entity"}
