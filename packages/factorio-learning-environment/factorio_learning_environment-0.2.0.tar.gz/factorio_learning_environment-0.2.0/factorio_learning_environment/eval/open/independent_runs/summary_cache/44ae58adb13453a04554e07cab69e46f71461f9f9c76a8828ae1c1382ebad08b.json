{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-16.0, -51.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (4 units)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Warnings: Output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Drop Position: (-16.5, -52.5)\n  - Resources: Iron Ore (40,000 units)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-14.0, -49.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (14 units)\n  - Status: No Ingredients\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Furnace Result: Iron Plate (60 units)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied or invalid locations\n- **Transport Belt**: Ensure the desired location is free of other entities or obstacles before attempting to place a Transport Belt.\n- **Burner Inserter**: Verify that the target location for placing a Burner Inserter is not occupied by another entity.\n- **Wooden Chest**: Confirm that the drill's drop position or any other intended location is clear before placing a Wooden Chest.\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities from specific positions\n- **Stone Furnace**: Ensure the specified position for retrieving a Stone Furnace is correct and that an entity of this type exists at that location. Double-check coordinates to avoid retrieval errors.\n\n### General Tips\n- Always verify the target position is valid and unoccupied before placing any entity.\n- Regularly check the status and warnings of entities like drills and furnaces to ensure they are functioning correctly and efficiently.\n- Consider setting up a proper sink entity to accept outputs from drills to prevent output blockage."}
