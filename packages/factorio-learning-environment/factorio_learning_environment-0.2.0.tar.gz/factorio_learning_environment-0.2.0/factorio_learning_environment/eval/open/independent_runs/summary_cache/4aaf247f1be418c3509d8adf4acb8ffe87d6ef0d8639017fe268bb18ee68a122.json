{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Chest at position(-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of:\n- Wooden chest (position -14.5, -48.5) containing 172 iron ore.\n\n### Stone Furnace at position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace (position 0.0, 0.0) currently out of fuel, with a furnace source containing 50 iron ore and producing 85 iron plates.\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position(-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (position -15.0, -50.0) currently out of fuel, with a warning that the chest at drop position (-14.5, -48.5) is full.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n- **Errors when extracting items from the chest**\n  - Ensure that the chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) has enough items available for extraction before attempting to extract. The extraction fails when the quantity requested exceeds the available amount.\n  \n- **Errors when inserting items into the furnace**\n  - Ensure that the furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) has enough energy and is not full before attempting to insert items. The insertion fails if the furnace is out of fuel or if the furnace source is full.\n\n- **Errors when refueling the mining drill**\n  - Ensure that coal or another fuel source is available to refuel the burner mining drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) before attempting to operate it.\n\n- **Repeated errors when extracting from the chest**\n  - The agent has repeatedly attempted to extract iron ore from the chest without ensuring the quantity is available, leading to multiple extraction failures.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions Defined:**\n  - `extract_item(Prototype.IronOre, chest_entity, quantity)`\n    - Failure Mode: Could not extract due to insufficient items in the chest.\n  - `insert_item(Prototype.IronOre, furnace_entity, quantity)`\n    - Failure Mode: Could not insert due to furnace being out of fuel or full.\n\n- **Important Variables Assigned:**\n  - `extracted_ore`: int\n  - `chest_inventory`: dict\n  - `quantity`: int"}
