{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=-1.5, y=24.5)\nConsists of:\n- **Steam Engine** at position (x=-1.5, y=24.5) generating power.\n- **Boiler** at position (x=-5.5, y=24.0) with status NO_FUEL and connected to pipes.\n- **Offshore Pump** at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5) working to supply water.\n- **Pipe Group** connecting the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine, facilitating water and steam flow.\n\n### Lab Facility\nConsists of:\n- **Lab** with input of automation-science-pack and status NO_RESEARCH_IN_PROGRESS, located at position (x=6.0, y=-62.0).\n\n### Stone Furnace\nConsists of:\n- **Furnace** at position (x=6.0, y=-62.0) with status NO_INGREDIENTS, indicating it is not currently smelting any resources.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Error when trying to access non-existent entities\n- Ensure the entity type and position are correct before attempting to access it. For example, the error at position (x=6.0, y=-62.0) indicates no lab was found; verify the lab's existence and its position.\n\n### NameError due to undefined variables\n- Verify that all entities and variables are properly defined and imported before use. The error \"Name 'Lab' is not defined\" suggests a missing or incorrect import or definition. Double-check the code for correct entity references.\n\n### Handling of entities with no ingredients or fuel\n- Regularly check the status of entities like furnaces and boilers to ensure they have the necessary ingredients or fuel to function. The furnace and boiler errors indicate a lack of resources, which can be mitigated by maintaining a steady supply of necessary inputs."}
