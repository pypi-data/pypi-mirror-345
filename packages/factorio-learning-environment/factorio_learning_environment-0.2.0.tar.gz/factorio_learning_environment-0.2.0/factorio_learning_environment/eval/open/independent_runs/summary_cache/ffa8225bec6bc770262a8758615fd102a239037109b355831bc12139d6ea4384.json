{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Inserter Production Line at position(23.5, 2.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine-1 for crafting inserters\n- Two burner inserters:\n  - One at position(21.5, 2.5) facing left\n  - One at position(25.5, 2.5) facing left\n- Two wooden chests:\n  - Input chest at position(20.5, 2.5) containing 232 inserters\n  - Output chest at position(26.5, 2.5)\n\n### Smelting Area\nConsists of five stone furnaces:\n- Two furnaces at positions(0.0, 0.0) and (2.0, 0.0)\n- Three furnaces at positions(4.0, 4.0), (6.0, 4.0), and one more nearby\nCurrently all furnaces are idle with no ingredients\n\n### Power Generation System\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position(-9.5, 24.5) extracting water\n- Boiler at position(-2.5, 24.0) converting water to steam\n- Steam engine at position(4.5, 24.5) generating electricity\n- Connected by two pipe networks:\n  - Water system (ID 36547) connecting offshore pump to boiler\n  - Steam system (ID 36551) connecting boiler to steam engine\n- Electrical distribution network (ID 123372) with multiple electric poles\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Resource Management Errors\n- Ensure sufficient coal is maintained in inventory for boiler operation\n- Keep required ingredients (iron plates, iron gear wheels) in inventory before attempting crafting operations\n\n### Crafting System Errors\n- Cannot craft items requiring furnace (like iron plates) directly - must use furnace\n- Ensure all prerequisite materials are available before attempting to craft complex items\n- For assembler operations, verify all required ingredients are present before starting assembly\n\n### Power System Issues\n- Monitor power system status to ensure continuous electricity supply\n- Keep boiler fueled with coal to maintain steam production\n- Ensure proper pipe connections between boiler and steam engine are maintained\n\n### Assembly Machine Operation\n- Verify assembler has power before attempting production\n- Check all required ingredients are available in correct quantities\n- Monitor assembler status for ingredient shortages or power issues"}
