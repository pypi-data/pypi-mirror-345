{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Transport System at Position (x=40.0, y=-84.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=40.0, y=-84.0), fueled with coal and aligned with a transport belt.\n- Transport Belts connecting the mining drill to various points, including positions (x=41.5, y=-85.5), (x=41.5, y=-84.5), (x=41.5, y=-83.5), and (x=41.5, y=-82.5).\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=40.5, y=-82.5) directing items from the transport belt into a wooden chest at position (x=40.5, y=-81.5).\n- Wooden Chests at positions (x=40.5, y=-81.5) and (x=42.5, y=-80.5) for item storage.\n- Multiple BeltGroups facilitating item movement across the system.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-15.0, y=-49.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- BeltGroups and transport belts facilitating the movement of resources to and from the furnace.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Misalignment of Drill Drop Position\n- Ensure that the drill drop position is correctly aligned with the transport belt to facilitate efficient item movement.\n\n### Full Chest Warnings\n- Regularly check and clear out chests to prevent them from becoming full, which can block inserters and halt production.\n\n### Output Blocked by Items on the Ground\n- Regularly clear items blocking the drill output to maintain continuous production flow."}
