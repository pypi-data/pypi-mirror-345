{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Copper Plate Mine at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) with fuel inventory containing 9 units of coal, currently working, and connected to a Stone Furnace.\n- Stone Furnace at position (41.0, -80.0) with fuel inventory containing 1 unit of coal, currently working, but with no results in the furnace result inventory.\n- Wooden Chest at position (43.5, -79.5), currently empty.\n\n#### Iron Plate Mine at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) with fuel inventory containing 9 units of coal, currently working, and connected to a Wooden Chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5), currently empty.\n\n#### Copper Furnace at Position (-20.0, -71.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -71.0) with no fuel and no ingredients to smelt, status indicating \"NO_FUEL\".\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors due to Insufficient Inventory for Insertion\n- Ensure that there is sufficient coal in the inventory before attempting to insert it into furnaces or drills. This will prevent errors such as \"Could not insert: No coal to insert from your inventory.\"\n\n#### Errors when Furnaces Run Out of Fuel\n- Regularly check the fuel status of furnaces to ensure they are not out of fuel. This will avoid warnings such as \"out of fuel\" and \"no ingredients to smelt.\"\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n#### Utility Functions\n- `insert_item`: This function is used to insert a specified quantity of an item into a target entity. It failed when there was no coal available in the inventory to be inserted.\n\n#### Important Variables\n- `iron_furnace`: Represents the iron furnace entity where coal is inserted.\n- `copper_mining_drill`: Represents the copper mining drill entity where coal is inserted.\n- `iron_mining_drill`: Represents the iron mining drill entity where coal is inserted."}
