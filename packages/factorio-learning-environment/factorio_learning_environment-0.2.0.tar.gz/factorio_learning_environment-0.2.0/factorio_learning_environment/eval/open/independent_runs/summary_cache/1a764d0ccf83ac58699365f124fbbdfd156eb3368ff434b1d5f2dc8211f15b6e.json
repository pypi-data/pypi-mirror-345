{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 19.5)\nConsists of:\n- **Steam Engine** at position (-5.5, 19.5)\n- **Boiler** at position (-2.5, 24.0)\n- **Offshore Pump** at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- **Pipe Group** connecting the boiler to the steam engine, with pipes positioned from (-5.5, 16.5) to (-2.5, 22.5)\n- **Pipe Group** connecting the offshore pump to the boiler, with pipes positioned from (-9.5, 23.5) to (-4.5, 24.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Crafting Due to Missing Ingredients\n- Ensure you have all required ingredients before attempting to craft an item. For example, crafting a steam engine requires iron plates, iron gear wheels, and pipes. Make sure to gather or produce these ingredients beforehand.\n\n### Errors When Using Unsupported Operand Types\n- When performing arithmetic operations, ensure that all operands are of compatible types. For example, avoid adding a 'ModelPrivateAttr' type to an integer.\n\n### Errors in Placing Entities Without Inventory\n- Verify that you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to place an entity. For instance, ensure you have a steam engine or small electric pole in your inventory before trying to place them.\n\n### Errors in Inserting Items Without Inventory\n- Check your inventory for the required items before attempting to insert them into another entity. For example, ensure you have coal in your inventory before inserting it into a boiler.\n\n### Errors in Connecting Entities Without Required Items\n- Ensure you have the necessary items, such as pipes, in your inventory before attempting to connect entities like boilers and steam engines."}
