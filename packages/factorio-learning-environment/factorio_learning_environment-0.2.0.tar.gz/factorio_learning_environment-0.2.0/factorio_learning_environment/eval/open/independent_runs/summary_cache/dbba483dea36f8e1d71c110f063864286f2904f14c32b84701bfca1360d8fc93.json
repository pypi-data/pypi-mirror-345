{"content": "Based on the execution logs and entity data, I'll generate a new report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Smelting Complex (around y=-81)\nConsists of:\n- Two stone furnaces at positions (45.0, -81.0) and (47.0, -81.0)\n- Two burner inserters at (45.5, -82.5) and (47.5, -82.5) moving items to output chests\n- Output wooden chests at (45.5, -83.5) and (47.5, -83.5) containing iron plates\n- Distribution system:\n  - Main input inserter at (46.5, -79.5)\n  - Input wooden chest at (46.5, -78.5) containing iron ore\n  - Transport belts at (45.5, -79.5) and (47.5, -79.5)\n\n### Coal Mining System (around y=-82)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0) mining coal\n- Output iron chest at (41.5, -83.5) containing coal\n- Storage iron chest at (41.5, -84.5) containing coal (full)\n\n### Storage Area (around y=-79.5)\n- Wooden chest at (49.5, -79.5) containing coal and iron plates (full)\n- Wooden chest at (49.5, -80.5) containing coal (full)\n\nERROR TIPS\n1. Entity Placement Conflicts\n- Before placing entities, check if the target location is already occupied\n- Multiple attempts to place burner-inserters and transport-belts failed due to existing entities\n- Consider checking entity dimensions and ensuring adequate spacing\n\n2. Invalid Entity Connections\n- Cannot directly connect belts to furnaces\n- Use inserters as intermediaries between belts and furnaces\n- Verify compatible connection types between different entity types\n\n3. Resource Management\n- Several chests are full and cannot accept more items\n- Consider implementing overflow protection or larger storage solutions\n- Monitor fuel levels in burner mining drills to prevent \"out of fuel\" warnings\n\nNAMESPACE\nImportant Variables:\n- input_inserter: BurnerInserter\n- main_belt: TransportBelt\n- left_inserter: BurnerInserter\n- right_inserter: BurnerInserter\n\nFunctions:\n- place_entity(): Places entities on the map\n- connect_entities(): Attempts to connect compatible entities\n\nNote: Several placement functions show consistent failures when attempting to place entities in occupied spaces, suggesting a need for position validation before placement attempts."}
