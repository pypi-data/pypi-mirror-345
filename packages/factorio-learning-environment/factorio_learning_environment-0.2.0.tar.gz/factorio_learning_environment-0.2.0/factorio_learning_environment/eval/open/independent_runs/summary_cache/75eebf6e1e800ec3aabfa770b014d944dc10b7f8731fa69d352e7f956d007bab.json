{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (0.0, 0.0) and (2.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with a fuel inventory of coal and a full output of iron plates.\n- Furnace at position (2.0, 0.0) with a fuel inventory of coal and a full output of iron plates.\n\n### Coal Mining and Distribution System at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) which is out of fuel.\n- Burner Inserter at position (41.5, -83.5) waiting for source items, connected to the mining drill and wooden chests.\n- Wooden Chest at position (40.5, -83.5) and (42.5, -83.5), with the latter containing coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (41.5, -80.5) waiting for source items, connected to the mining drill and a wooden chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -79.5) containing coal.\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (42.5, -83.5) to (45.5, -83.5) with coal inventory.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entities (e.g., mining drills or chests) have items available for inserters to transfer. Regularly check and refuel or restock these entities as needed.\n\n### Errors due to Burner Mining Drill Out of Fuel\n- Regularly refuel burner mining drills to ensure continuous operation. Monitor fuel levels and automate refueling processes where possible to prevent downtime.\n\n### Errors due to Full Output in Furnaces\n- Regularly clear the output of furnaces to prevent production halts. Consider using inserters to automatically transfer items from furnaces to chests or belts."}
