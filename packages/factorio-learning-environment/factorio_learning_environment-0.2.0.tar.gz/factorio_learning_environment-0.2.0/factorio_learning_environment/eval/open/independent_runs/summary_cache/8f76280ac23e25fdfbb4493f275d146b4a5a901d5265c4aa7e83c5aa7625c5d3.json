{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Coal Mining Operation at position (41, -82)\nConsists of a burner mining drill at position (41, -82) and two wooden chests at positions (40.5, -83.5) and (41.5, -83.5) for storing coal.\n\n### Coal Transportation System\nConsists of a burner inserter at position (39.5, -81.5) that transports coal from the mining operation to a drop position.\n\n### Furnace at position (0, 0)\nConsists of a stone furnace at position (0, 0) with a fuel inventory of coal.\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n* **Inventory Full Errors**: Ensure that the inventory of entities such as chests and furnaces are not full before attempting to insert items. Check the inventory status of entities before performing insert operations.\n* **Fuel Source Full Errors**: Ensure that the fuel source of entities such as burner mining drills and burner inserters are not full before attempting to operate. Check the fuel level of entities before performing operations.\n* **No Ingredients to Smelt Errors**: Ensure that the furnace has the necessary ingredients to smelt before attempting to operate. Check the furnace source inventory before performing smelting operations.\n* **Chest at Drop Position is Full Errors**: Ensure that the chest at the drop position is not full before attempting to transport items. Check the inventory status of the chest at the drop position before performing transportation operations.\n\n# NAMESPACE\n* **Important Variables**:\n  + `coal_chest`: a wooden chest for storing coal\n  + `iron_chest`: a wooden chest for storing iron plates\n  + `drill`: a burner mining drill for mining coal\n  + `inserter`: a burner inserter for transporting coal\n  + `furnace`: a stone furnace for smelting iron plates\n* **Utility Functions**:\n  + `insert_item`: a function for inserting items into entities\n  + `extract_item`: a function for extracting items from entities\n  + `check_inventory`: a function for checking the inventory status of entities\n  + `check_fuel_level`: a function for checking the fuel level of entities\n  + `check_furnace_source`: a function for checking the furnace source inventory"}
