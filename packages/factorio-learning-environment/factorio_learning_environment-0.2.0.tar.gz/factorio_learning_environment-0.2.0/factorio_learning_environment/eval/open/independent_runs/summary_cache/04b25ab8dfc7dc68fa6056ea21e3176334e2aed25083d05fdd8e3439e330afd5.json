{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-47.5, -122.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\n- Pipe at Position (-47.5, -122.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-46.5, -121.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (-41.5, -117.5)\n- Small Electric Pole at Position (-39.5, -116.5)\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-19.0, -73.0) with copper plates as output\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0) with iron plates as output\n- Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0)\n\n### Storage and Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5)\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) transferring items to Wooden Chest at Position (6.5, -59.5)\n\n### Research Lab\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab with input of automation science packs and status indicating no power\n\n### Pipe Networks\nConsists of multiple PipeGroups with various positions and statuses indicating fluid transfer capabilities.\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of an Electricity Group with multiple small electric poles at various positions, currently not connected to a power network.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Attribute Errors with PipeGroup\n- Ensure that you are accessing valid attributes of objects. The 'PipeGroup' object does not have a 'direction' attribute. Verify object properties before accessing them.\n\n### Connection Errors with Boiler\n- Ensure that the boiler is correctly connected to a water source. Check the alignment and connectivity of pipes from the offshore pump to the boiler to ensure water flow.\n\n### Power Connection Issues\n- Verify that all entities requiring power are connected to an active power network. Ensure that small electric poles are correctly placed to connect the steam engine to the power grid.\n\n### Inserter Power Issues\n- Ensure that inserters are connected to a power source. Check the placement of electric poles to provide power to inserters."}
