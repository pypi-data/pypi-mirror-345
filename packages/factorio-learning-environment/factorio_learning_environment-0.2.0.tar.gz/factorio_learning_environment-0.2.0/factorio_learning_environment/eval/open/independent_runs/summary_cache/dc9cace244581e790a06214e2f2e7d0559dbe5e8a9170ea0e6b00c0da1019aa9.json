{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) with a coal supply.\n- Wooden Chest at position (40.5, -83.5) storing coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (42.5, -83.5) for additional storage.\n- Burner Inserter at position (41.5, -83.5) transferring items between entities.\n- Stone Furnace at position (61.0, -54.0) and (64.0, -53.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden Chests at positions (61.5, -52.5), (62.5, -53.5), and (62.5, -52.5) for storing coal.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when extracting items from furnaces\n- Ensure that the furnace contains the items you intend to extract. Attempting to extract items that are not present will result in an error.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - `extract_item`: Used for extracting items from entities like furnaces. Ensure the entity contains the required items before extraction.\n\n- **Variables:**\n  - `extracted_plates_1`: Intended to store extracted iron plates from furnace_1.\n  - `extracted_plates_2`: Intended to store extracted iron plates from furnace_2."}
