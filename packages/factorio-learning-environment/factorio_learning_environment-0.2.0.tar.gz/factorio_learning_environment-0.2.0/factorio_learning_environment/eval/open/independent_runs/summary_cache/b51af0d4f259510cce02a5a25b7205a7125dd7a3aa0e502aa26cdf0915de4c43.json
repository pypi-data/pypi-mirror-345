{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Coal Mining Setup at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (41.0, -82.0)  \n- **Wooden Chest** at position (41.5, -80.5)  \n\nThe burner mining drill is extracting coal and dropping it into the wooden chest for storage.\n\n---\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when attempting to place entities in non-buildable positions\n- Ensure the target position is clear and buildable before placing entities like stone furnaces, burner mining drills, or wooden chests.  \n- Use the `is_buildable` check to verify if a tile is suitable for placement.\n\n#### Errors when trying to insert items into non-existent or unreachable entities\n- Verify the existence and accessibility of the target entity (e.g., stone furnace) before attempting to insert items like coal.  \n- Ensure the entity is within the player's interaction range.\n\n#### Errors when placing entities too far from the player\n- Move closer to the target position before placing entities. The maximum placement distance is 10 tiles from the player's current position.  \n\n#### Repeated attempts to retrieve non-existent entities\n- Avoid repeatedly querying for entities (e.g., stone furnace) at positions where they do not exist. Verify the entity's presence before interacting with it.  \n\n#### Errors when inserting items into entities that cannot accept them\n- Ensure the target entity (e.g., stone furnace) is capable of accepting the item (e.g., coal) before attempting insertion."}
