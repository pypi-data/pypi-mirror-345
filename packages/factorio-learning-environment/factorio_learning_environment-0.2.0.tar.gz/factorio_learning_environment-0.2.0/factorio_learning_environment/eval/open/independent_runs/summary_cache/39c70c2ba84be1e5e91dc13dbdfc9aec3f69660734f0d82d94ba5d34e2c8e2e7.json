{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-29.5, 30.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position -29.5, 30.5) and small electric pole (position -27.5, 29.5). The steam engine is currently not connected to a power network and has no input liquid.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(-18.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position -18.0, -49.0) and a furnace (position -18.0, -49.0) that is not working due to no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Copper cable factory at position(5.0, -73.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 5.0, -73.0) and a furnace (position 5.0, -73.0) that is not working due to no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Offshore pump at position(-10.5, 25.5)\nConsists of offshore pump (position -10.5, 25.5) which is currently working.\n\n### Boiler at position(-24.5, -50.0)\nConsists of boiler (position -24.5, -50.0) which is not working due to being out of fuel.\n\n### Lab at position(-18.0, -49.0)\nConsists of lab (position -18.0, -49.0) which is currently not powered.\n\n### PipeGroup at position(-24.5, -51.5)\nConsists of a fluid system (53557) with pipes connecting various positions, currently full of water.\n\n### PipeGroup at position(-4.5, 21.5)\nConsists of a fluid system (53560) with pipes connecting various positions, currently empty.\n\n### PipeGroup at position(-4.5, 23.5)\nConsists of a fluid system (53562) with pipes connecting various positions, currently empty.\n\n### ElectricityGroup at position(-17.5, 26.5)\nConsists of multiple small electric poles providing electricity to various entities, currently with a voltage of 0.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to furnace status\n- Ensure that the furnace has the necessary ingredients to operate before attempting to insert items. The furnace at position (5.0, -73.0) and (-18.0, -49.0) are not working due to no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Errors when using attributes of objects\n- Verify that the object you are trying to access has the correct attributes. The error regarding 'Position' object having no attribute 'name' indicates that the code is trying to access an attribute that doesn't exist. Ensure that the correct object type is being referenced.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it. Check for existing entities at the target position to avoid placement errors. \n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items."}
