{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at position (-14.0, -49.0) and (-16.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) with coal as fuel and iron ore being smelted into iron plates.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-16.0, -49.0) with coal as fuel and iron ore being smelted into iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-13.5, -46.5) to store iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -47.5) transferring iron plates from the furnace to the wooden chest.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure the target tile is not occupied by another entity before attempting to place a new entity. This will prevent placement issues like those encountered with the Transport Belt, Iron Chest, and Stone Furnace.\n\n### Errors due to incorrect crafting attempts\n- Iron plates cannot be crafted manually; they require a crafting machine or smelting in a furnace. Ensure you have the correct setup for crafting specific items.\n\n### Validation errors during entity placement\n- Ensure that the dimensions and other attributes of entities are correctly specified and valid integers to avoid validation errors. Double-check the attributes before placement.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient inventory\n- Always verify that you have the necessary materials in your inventory before attempting to insert items into entities, such as furnaces. This will prevent errors related to insufficient resources."}
