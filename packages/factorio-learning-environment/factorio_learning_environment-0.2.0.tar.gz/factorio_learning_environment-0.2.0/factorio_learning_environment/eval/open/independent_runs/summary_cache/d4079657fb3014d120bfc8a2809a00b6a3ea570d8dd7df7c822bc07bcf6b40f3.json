{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) responsible for extracting iron ore. It is currently out of fuel.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) storing iron ore extracted by the mining drill. The chest contains 449 units of iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace. The inserter is working but requires frequent refueling with coal.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) intended for smelting iron ore into iron plates. It currently has coal as fuel but is not receiving iron ore for smelting.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Alignment and Setup\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly aligned to transfer materials between entities. The inserter must be properly positioned to pick up items from the chest and drop them into the furnace. Regularly check and adjust the inserter's alignment if the furnace is not receiving iron ore.\n\n### Errors with Fuel Management\n- Regularly refuel the burner mining drill and burner inserter to maintain continuous operation. Monitor fuel levels to prevent interruptions in mining and transferring operations.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Operation\n- Verify that the furnace is receiving the necessary ingredients (iron ore) for smelting. If the furnace is not operating, check the inserter setup and ensure it is correctly transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace."}
