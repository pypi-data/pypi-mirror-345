{"content": "\"\"\"\nThe attempt to insert stone into the active furnace has failed again, indicating that the furnace is still holding **Copper Ore** and is unable to accept additional materials.\n\n### Current Active Furnace Output Status:\n- The furnace currently retains **3 pieces of Copper Ore** and **18 Iron Plates**.\n- The furnace is still in a **\"NO INGREDIENTS\"** state, which is preventing it from processing any materials.\n\n### Observations:\n- The furnace's inability to accept stone is due to the presence of Copper Ore, which is blocking the insertion of new materials.\n- To resolve this, I need to extract the Copper Ore from the furnace before I can load the required stone.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Extract Copper Ore from the Furnace**: Remove the Copper Ore currently in the active furnace.\n2. **Insert Stone into the Furnace**: After extraction, I can then load the necessary stone to enable the smelting process.\n3. **Reinsert Copper Ore for Processing**: Finally, I will reinsert the Copper Ore once the furnace is ready.\n\nLet's proceed to extract the Copper Ore from the active furnace. \n\"\"\"\n\n# Extract the Copper Ore from the active furnace\nextract_item(Prototype.CopperOre, active_furnace, quantity=3)  # Extract all 3 pieces of Copper Ore currently in the active furnace\n\n# Check the inventory status of the furnace after extraction\nactive_furnace_status_after_extraction = inspect_inventory(active_furnace)  # Inspect the status after extraction\noverall_inventory_after_extraction = inspect_inventory()  # Check total inventory after extraction.\n\nprint(f\"Active Furnace inventory status after extracting Copper Ore: {active_furnace_status_after_extraction}\")  # Status of the furnace after extraction.\nprint(f\"Overall current inventory after extracting Copper Ore: {overall_inventory_after_extraction}\")  # Total after operations.\nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")  # Review entities displayed on the map.", "summary_range": "[1-310]"}
