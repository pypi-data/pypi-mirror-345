{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-0.5, -9.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position -0.5, -9.5), boiler (position -4.5, 23.0), and offshore pump (position -7.5, 25.5). The steam engine is currently not connected to a power network and has no input liquid.\n\n### Copper plate factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace (position 0.0, 0.0) and another furnace (position 5.0, 5.0), both are stone furnaces with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Lab (position 0.5, -12.5) which is currently not powered.\n- Pipe groups at various positions for fluid transport, including:\n  - PipeGroup at position (-8.5, -6.5)\n  - PipeGroup at position (-6.5, -7.5)\n  - PipeGroup at position (-10.5, -4.5)\n  - PipeGroup at position (-9.5, -5.5)\n  - PipeGroup at position (-12.5, 23.5)\n  - PipeGroup at position (-17.5, 24.5)\n  - PipeGroup at position (-18.5, 26.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting boiler to steam engine\n- Ensure that the pipes are correctly placed and connected before attempting to connect the boiler to the steam engine. Check for any existing connections that may be obstructing the new connection.\n\n### Errors when placing lab\n- Ensure you have the lab in your inventory before attempting to place it. Check your inventory status before executing the placement command.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing. Check for any existing entities in the intended position."}
