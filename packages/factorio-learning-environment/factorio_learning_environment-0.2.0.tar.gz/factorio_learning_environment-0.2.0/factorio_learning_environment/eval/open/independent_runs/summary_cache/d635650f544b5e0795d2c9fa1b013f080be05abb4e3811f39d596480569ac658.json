{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Steam Power Plant\nThis structure is designed for generating electricity. It consists of an offshore pump providing water to two boiler-steam engine pairs via a pipe network. The boilers heat the water into steam, which powers the steam engines. The steam engines are connected by power poles to form a basic electrical grid.\n-   **Offshore Pump** at position (x=-9.5, y=-0.5): Extracts water.\n-   **Boiler 1** at position (x=8.0, y=13.5): Heats water using coal. Connected to Boiler 2 via water pipes.\n-   **Steam Engine 1** at position (x=13.5, y=13.5): Generates power from steam produced by Boiler 1. Connected to the power grid.\n-   **Boiler 2** at position (x=19.0, y=13.5): Heats water using coal. Receives water from Boiler 1 via pipes.\n-   **Steam Engine 2** at position (x=24.5, y=13.5): Generates power from steam produced by Boiler 2. Connected to the power grid.\n-   **Pipe Network**: Connects the Offshore Pump to Boiler 1, Boiler 1 to Boiler 2 (water), Boiler 1 to Steam Engine 1 (steam), and Boiler 2 to Steam Engine 2 (steam). Includes pipes at various positions, e.g., (x=7.5, y=16.5), (x=18.5, y=16.5), (x=18.5, y=15.5), (x=9.5, y=13.5), (x=20.5, y=13.5).\n-   **Power Pole Network**: Connects Steam Engine 1 and Steam Engine 2. Includes poles"}
