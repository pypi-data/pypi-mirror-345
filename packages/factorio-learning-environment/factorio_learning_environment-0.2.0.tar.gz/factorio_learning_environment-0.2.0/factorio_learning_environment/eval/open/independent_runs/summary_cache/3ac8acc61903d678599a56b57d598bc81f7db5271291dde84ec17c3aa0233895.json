{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-11.5, 18.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam engine (position -11.5, 18.5)\n- Boiler (position -11.5, 25.0)\n- Offshore pump (position -9.5, 24.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting the steam engine, boiler, and offshore pump.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(0, 0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (position 0, 0) and a furnace (position 0, 0)\n- Burner mining drill (position 5, 5) and a furnace (position 5, 5)\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine (position z1) and inserter (position a) that puts into the assembling machine\n- Beltgroup connecting the furnace at position y1 to the assembling machine at position z1\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when crafting items due to missing ingredients\n- Ensure that you have the required ingredients available in your inventory before attempting to craft items. In this case, iron plates are needed to craft pipes.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing. \n\n### Errors with furnace output being full\n- Monitor the output of furnaces and ensure that they are not full before inserting new materials. If the output is full, consider crafting or removing the items to free up space."}
