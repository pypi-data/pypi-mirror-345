{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll generate a comprehensive report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Setup (around x=41, y=-82)\n- Burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0) mining coal\n- Two iron chests at (41.5, -84.5) and (41.5, -83.5) storing coal (1600 each)\n- Wooden chest at (41.5, -80.5) for temporary coal storage (799 coal)\n\n### Coal Transport and Smelting System (around x=43, y=-80)\n- Chest output inserter at (41.5, -79.5) moving coal from wooden chest to transport belt\n- Belt system consisting of:\n  - First belt at (42.5, -79.5)\n  - Second belt at (43.5, -79.5)\n  - Third belt at (43.5, -80.5)\n- Furnace input inserter at (43.5, -81.5)\n- Two stone furnaces:\n  - First furnace at (45.0, -81.0)\n  - Second furnace at (47.0, -81.0)\n- Output wooden chest at (49.5, -80.5) containing 1500 iron plates\n\nERROR TIPS\n1. Entity Placement Conflicts\n- Before placing entities, verify there are no existing objects in the target location\n- Multiple attempts to place burner-inserters failed due to occupied spaces at:\n  - (41.5, -81.5)\n  - (44.5, -80.5)\n  - (43.5, -80.5)\n\n2. Resource Management\n- Mining drill is running without fuel - ensure consistent fuel supply\n- Monitor and manage fuel levels in burner-based entities\n\n3. Entity Status Management\n- Several entities are in waiting states:\n  - Inserters waiting for source items\n  - Furnaces showing NO_INGREDIENTS status\n  - Ensure proper connection and flow between components\n\nNAMESPACE\nImportant Variables:\n- chest_inserter: BurnerInserter\n- furnace_inserter: BurnerInserter\n- mining_drill: BurnerMiningDrill\n- transport_belt: TransportBelt\n\nEntity States:\n- EntityStatus.WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION\n- EntityStatus.WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS\n- EntityStatus.NO_INGREDIENTS\n- EntityStatus.NO_FUEL\n- EntityStatus.NORMAL"}
