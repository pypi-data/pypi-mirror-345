{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=17.5, y=20.5) with warnings of 'no input liquid' and 'no fluid present in connections'.\n- Boiler at position (x=1.5, y=23.0) with a warning of 'out of fuel'.\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5) currently working and supplying water.\n- Pipe network connecting these entities, with various pipe positions such as (x=-9.5, y=23.5) and (x=3.5, y=17.5).\n\n### Pipe Groups\n- PipeGroup with fluid system 19107 at position (x=3.5, y=17.5), status is empty.\n- PipeGroup with fluid system 19118 at position (x=-9.5, y=23.5), status is full output, carrying water.\n\n### Electricity Network\n- ElectricityGroup with id 35773, consisting of poles at various positions such as (x=7.5, y=8.5), (x=1.5, y=6.5), and (x=27.5, y=26.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing small electric poles\n- Ensure there is a suitable position available for placing small electric poles. Consider clearing obstacles or choosing a different location if placement fails.\n\n### Warnings of 'no input liquid' and 'no fluid present in connections' for steam engine\n- Check the connections to ensure that liquid inputs are properly connected and that there are no blockages in the fluid network.\n\n### Boiler 'out of fuel' warning\n- Regularly refuel the boiler to maintain its operation and ensure it can produce the necessary steam for the steam engine.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions**: None defined in the logs.\n- **Important Variables**: \n  - `current_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the current inventory of items.\n  - `fluid_systems`: List[int] - Represents different fluid systems in the network.\n  - `electricity_group_id`: int - Identifier for the electricity network group.\n\nNo utility functions were invoked or defined in the provided steps."}
