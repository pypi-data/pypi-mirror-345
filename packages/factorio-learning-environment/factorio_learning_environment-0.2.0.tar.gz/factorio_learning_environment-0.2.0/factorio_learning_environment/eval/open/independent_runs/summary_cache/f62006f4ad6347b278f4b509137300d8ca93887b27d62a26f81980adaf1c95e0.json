{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, -60.0) with a drop position at (4.5, -58.5), connected to:\n  - **Wooden Chest** at position (4.5, -58.5) for collecting mined iron ore.\n  - **Wooden Chest** at position (5.5, -60.5) as a neighbouring entity.\n- **Furnaces** for smelting iron ore into iron plates:\n  - **Stone Furnace** at position (-15.0, -48.0)\n  - **Stone Furnace** at position (-13.0, -48.0)\n  - **Stone Furnace** at position (-11.0, -48.0)\n- **Iron Chest** at position (-5.5, -50.5) for storing processed iron plates and iron ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Full Chests\n- Ensure that chests are regularly emptied to prevent mining drills from stopping due to full storage. The burner mining drill at position (4.0, -60.0) is unable to continue mining because the chest at (4.5, -58.5) is full.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Operations\n- Ensure furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Furnaces at positions (-15.0, -48.0), (-13.0, -48.0), and (-11.0, -48.0) have warnings indicating \"no ingredients to smelt.\"\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined by the agent in the provided steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `iron_ore`: int, represents the quantity of iron ore extracted and stored.\n- `iron_plate`: int, represents the quantity of iron plates extracted and stored.\n- `coal`: int, represents the quantity of coal inserted into burner mining drills and furnaces."}
