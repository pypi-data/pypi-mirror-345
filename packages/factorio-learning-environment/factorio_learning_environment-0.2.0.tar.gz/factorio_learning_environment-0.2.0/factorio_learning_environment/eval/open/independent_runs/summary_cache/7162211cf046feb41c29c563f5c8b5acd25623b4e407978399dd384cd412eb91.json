{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal\n  - Status: Working\n  - Neighbors: Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5)\n  - Warnings: Chest at drop position is full. Empty the chest at (-14.5, -48.5) to continue mining.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5)\n  - Inventory: Iron Ore and Iron Plates\n  - Status: Normal\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal\n  - Status: No Ingredients\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Furnace Result: Iron Plates\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5)\n  - Fuel: Coal\n  - Status: Working\n  - Neighbors: Wooden Chest, Burner Mining Drill, Stone Furnace\n  - Pickup Position: (-12.5, -48.5)\n  - Drop Position: (-14.5, -48.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when refueling entities\n- Ensure you have enough coal in your inventory before attempting to refuel any entity. Plan your coal harvesting and distribution to maintain a steady supply.\n\n### Errors with furnace production\n- Ensure that the furnace has both fuel and ingredients (iron ore) to produce iron plates. Regularly check and maintain the supply chain to prevent production halts.\n\n### Errors with chest management\n- Regularly empty the chest at (-14.5, -48.5) to prevent mining operations from stopping due to a full chest. Consider expanding storage or increasing processing capacity to handle the output efficiently."}
