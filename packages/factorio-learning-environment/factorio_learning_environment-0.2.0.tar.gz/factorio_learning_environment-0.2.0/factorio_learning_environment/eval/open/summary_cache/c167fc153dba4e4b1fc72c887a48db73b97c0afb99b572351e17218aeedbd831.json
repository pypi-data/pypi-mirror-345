{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron ore mining and smelting structure at position around (17.5, 72.5)\nConsists of the following connected entities:\n- Electric mining drill at position (17.5, 72.5) facing down, currently without power and output blocked due to furnace belt blockage.\n- Stone furnace at position (18.0, 75.0) used for smelting iron ore, fueled with coal, currently working but with frequent full output inventory warnings.\n- Two wooden chests at positions (19.5, 75.5) and (21.5, 75.5), serving as storage for smelted iron plates; the chest at (21.5, 75.5) now contains iron plates and is actively used as input for assembling.\n- Additional wooden chest at (21.5, 77.5) placed to receive iron plates, currently often empty.\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5) and (20.5, 77.5) fueled and operational, feeding chests.\n- Small electric pole at (15.5, 75.5) connected to power network.\n- Output blockage at furnace belt remains unresolved, causing mining drill to be without power and blocked output.\n\nThis structure enables extraction, smelting, and staged storage of iron plates, with improved inserter fueling and active material flow into assembling machine input chest.\n\n### Steam power generation structure at position around (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, -0.5) extracting water.\n- Boiler at position (-5.0, 2.5), currently out of fuel and not working.\n- Steam engine at position (0.5, 6.5), not connected to power network and lacking fluid input, currently not working.\n- Small electric poles near boiler (-4.5, -0.5) and steam engine (0.5, 3.5).\n\nThis structure is intended for steam power generation but currently non-operational due to boiler fuel shortage and steam engine power disconnection.\n\n### Iron gear wheel assembly structure at position around (25.5, 80.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine 2 at (25.5, 80.5), currently without power and not crafting due to missing iron plates and insufficient power connection.\n- Input wooden chest at (21.5, 75.5) feeding iron plates into assembly area, now actively stocked and used.\n- Output wooden chest at (25.5, 82.5), currently empty.\n- Output burner inserter at (25.5, 83.5) fueled and operational but waiting for source items.\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 77.5) and (25.5, 83.5) fueled and operational.\n- Small electric pole at (25.5, 77.5) connected to power network but assembling machine still reports no power.\n\nThis structure is set up for iron gear wheel production with improved material input flow but remains non-functional due to power and crafting resource issues.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity placement conflicts due to occupied tiles\n- Previous errors placing small electric poles near steam engine persist; steam engine remains unpowered and disconnected.\n- Verify tile occupancy before placing poles; consider repositioning or removing conflicting entities to establish power network connectivity.\n\n### Inserter inventory and fuel management\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5), (20.5, 77.5), and (25.5, 83.5) consistently fueled and operational.\n- Inserters still report waiting for source items when input chests are empty.\n- Maintain steady supply of input materials to inserters to avoid stoppages.\n\n### Crafting and recipe dependency errors\n- Assembling machine 2 at (25.5, 80.5) remains without power and unable to craft iron gear wheels despite sufficient iron plates in input chest.\n- Assembling machine input and output inventories often empty or unchanged, indicating crafting not proceeding.\n- Ensure assembling machine is properly connected to power network and has clear output paths.\n- Confirm recipe requirements and supply sufficient input materials.\n\n### Output blockage and power connectivity warnings\n- Mining drill at (17.5, 72.5) continues to report \"furnace belt at drop position is blocked,\" causing output blockage and power loss.\n- Stone furnace output inventory frequently full, preventing further smelting output.\n- Boiler at (-5.0, 2.5) is out of fuel, causing steam engine at (0.5, 6.5) to be non-operational and unpowered.\n- To resolve output blockage, clear or extend output belts and chests to accept items.\n- Refuel boiler to restore steam power generation and connect steam engine to power network.\n\n### Item extraction errors from empty chests\n- Multiple errors extracting iron plates from wooden chest at"}
