{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=10.5, y=34.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam engine at position (x=10.5, y=34.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=5.5, y=27.0)\n- Offshore pump at position (x=0.5, y=30.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine\n\n### Stone Furnace Setup at Position (x=15.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace at position (x=15.0, y=0.0)\n- Inserters at positions (x=17.5, y=0.5) and (x=16.5, y=0.5)\n- Wooden chests at positions (x=5.5, y=0.5) and (x=18.5, y=0.5)\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- Multiple pipe groups connecting various entities, including offshore pumps and boilers, with some pipes having fluid (water) and others being empty.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Boiler and Steam Engine Not Being Connected\n- Ensure that the boiler and steam engine are correctly connected to each other and to the electricity network to avoid the \"EntityStatus.NOT_CONNECTED\" status.\n\n### AttributeError: 'PipeGroup' Object Has No Attribute 'fluid'\n- When accessing attributes of a PipeGroup, ensure that the correct attribute names are used. The 'fluid' attribute does not exist on PipeGroup objects.\n\n### Inserter Not Receiving Electricity\n- Ensure that inserters are connected to a power network to avoid \"not receiving electricity\" warnings. Check the connections with small electric poles.\n\n### Boiler and Steam Engine Warnings\n- Address warnings such as \"no input liquid\" and \"no fluid present in connections\" by ensuring that the fluid system is correctly set up and connected to the appropriate entities.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the inserter's source and destination are correctly set up and that there are items available for the inserter to pick up."}
