{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and deposits it into the adjacent chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0): Smelts iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Insufficient Fuel Management\n- Ensure sufficient coal is available in the inventory to refuel mining drills and furnaces. Regularly check fuel levels and replenish as needed to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Inserter Misalignment\n- Verify that inserters are correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items between entities. Reposition and align inserters if items are not being transferred as expected.\n\n### Chest Overflow and Management\n- Regularly check and manage the inventory of chests to prevent overflow. Extract items from chests to avoid halting production due to full storage.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Ingredients\n- Ensure that the furnace is receiving the necessary ingredients for smelting. Check the inserter setup and reposition if the furnace is not receiving iron ore.\n\n### Production Stoppage Due to Lack of Ingredients\n- Monitor the furnace's inventory to ensure it has the required ingredients for smelting. Address any warnings about missing ingredients promptly to resume production."}
