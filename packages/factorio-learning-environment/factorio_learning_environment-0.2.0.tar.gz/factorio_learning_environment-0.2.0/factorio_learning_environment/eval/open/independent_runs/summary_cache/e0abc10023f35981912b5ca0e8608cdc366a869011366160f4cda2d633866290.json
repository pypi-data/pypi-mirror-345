{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll generate a report:\n\n# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining System at (-82, 41)\n- Burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0) mining coal\n- Iron chest at (41.5, -83.5) collecting coal, connected to mining drill\n- Additional iron chest at (41.5, -84.5) storing coal (full with 1600 coal)\n\n### Iron Smelting System (-81 to -77, 45 to 47)\nA dual furnace setup with input and output handling:\n\nInput Section:\n- Wooden chest at (46.5, -77.5) holding iron ore\n- Two burner inserters at (45.5, -78.5) and (47.5, -78.5) facing up\n- Transport belts at (45.5, -79.5) and (47.5, -79.5)\n\nProcessing Section:\n- Two stone furnaces at (45.0, -81.0) and (47.0, -81.0)\n\nOutput Section:\n- Two burner inserters at (45.5, -82.5) and (47.5, -82.5)\n- Output wooden chest at (46.5, -83.5)\n- Additional wooden chest at (45.5, -84.5)\n\n### Storage Area (-79.5 to -80.5, 49.5)\n- Wooden chest at (49.5, -79.5) storing coal and iron plates (full)\n- Wooden chest at (49.5, -80.5) storing coal (full)\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n1. Resource Management Issues\n   - Multiple chests are showing \"chest is full\" warnings - consider adding more storage or better item distribution\n   - Mining drill showing \"out of fuel\" warning - implement automated fuel feeding system\n\n2. Production Flow Issues\n   - Furnaces showing \"no ingredients to smelt\" - ensure proper item flow from input chest through the transport system\n   - Multiple inserters in \"WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS\" state - verify inserter pickup/drop positions align with intended item flow\n\n# NAMESPACE\nImportant Variables:\n- None explicitly defined in provided logs\n\nThe logs show multiple attempts at configuring an automated smelting system with several corrections to inserter orientations and chest positions, but no explicit function definitions are shown."}
