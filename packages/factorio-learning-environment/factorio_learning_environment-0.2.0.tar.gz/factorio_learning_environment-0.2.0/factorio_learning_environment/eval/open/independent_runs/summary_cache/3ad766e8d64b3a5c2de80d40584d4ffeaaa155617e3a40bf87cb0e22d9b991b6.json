{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll generate a new report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing Line (around x=41-46, y=-80 to -82)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0) mining coal\n- Transport belt system:\n  - 3 belts in sequence from (41.5, -80.5) to (43.5, -80.5), all facing right\n  - Currently holding 12 coal\n- Stone furnace at (45.0, -80.0) facing up\n- The system is partially operational with the mining drill working but waiting for space in destination\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Conflicts\n- When placing multiple entities in close proximity, ensure proper spacing and check for entity collisions\n- Consider the order of placement (furnace first, then inserter) as it affects valid placement positions\n- Check entity dimensions (furnaces are 2x2, inserters are 1x1) when planning layouts\n\n### Entity Alignment Issues\n- Ensure inserter drop position aligns precisely with furnace input position\n- Verify distances between connected entities (observed distance of ~0.707 between inserter drop and furnace center indicates misalignment)\n- Pay attention to entity rotation and direction when placing connected components\n\n### Belt System Blockages\n- Clear blocked belts before attempting to place new entities\n- Ensure proper flow management to prevent backup of materials\n- Monitor belt system inventory to prevent overflow\n\n### Entity Status Management\n- Address \"WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION\" status by ensuring output paths are clear\n- Handle \"NO_INGREDIENTS\" status in furnaces by verifying input mechanisms\n- Check entity warnings to identify and resolve operational issues\n\nNAMESPACE\n\n### Variables\n- `mining_drill`: BurnerMiningDrill\n- `belt_group`: BeltGroup\n- `inserter`: BurnerInserter\n- `furnace`: Furnace\n\n### Entity States\n- EntityStatus.WORKING: Observed in mining drill when operational\n- EntityStatus.WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION: Common when output is blocked\n- EntityStatus.NO_INGREDIENTS: Observed in furnace when input is missing\n\nThe system appears to be attempting to build a coal processing line but is experiencing placement and alignment issues that prevent proper operation."}
