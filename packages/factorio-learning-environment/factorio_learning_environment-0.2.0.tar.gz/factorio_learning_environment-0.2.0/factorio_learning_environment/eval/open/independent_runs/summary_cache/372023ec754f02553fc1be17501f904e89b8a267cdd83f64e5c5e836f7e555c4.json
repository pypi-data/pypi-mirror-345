{"content": "Here is the updated report:\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone processing setup at position(x=-50.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (position x=-50.0, y=0.0)\n- Stone furnace (position x=-54.0, y=0.0)\n- Wooden chest (position x=-51.5, y=0.5)\n- Burner inserter (position x=-51.5, y=-0.5)\n\n### New mining setup at position(x=-46.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (position x=-46.0, y=0.0)\n- Stone furnace (position x=-43.0, y=0.0)\n- Burner inserter (position x=-44.5, y=-0.5)\n\n### Production facility at position(x=20.0, y=20.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (position x=-46.0, y=21.0)\n- Stone furnace (position x=23.0, y=20.0)\n- Burner inserter (position x=21.5, y=20.5)\n- Assembling machine 2 (position x=26.5, y=20.5)\n- Output chest (position x=28.5, y=20.5)\n- Small electric pole network (positions x=24.5,y=18.5 to x=26.5,y=18.5)\n\n### Partial power plant at position(x=24.5, y=17.0)\nConsists of:\n- Boiler (position x=24.5, y=17.0)\n- Pipe network connecting to offshore pump (positions x=-8.5,y=-0.5 to x=22.5,y=17.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Placement validation errors (continued)\n- Multiple attempts to place burner mining drills at occupied positions (x=-46.0,y=0.0 and x=-46.5,y=-0.5)\n- Failed to place transport belt at x=-46.0,y=-0.5 due to existing obstruction\n- Steam engine placement failed at x=26.5,y=17.0 due to terrain/obstruction\n\n### Entity removal issues (new)\n- Multiple failed attempts to remove non-existent entities across a wide area (x=-50 to -41, y=-5 to 24)\n- Verify entity existence before attempting removal to avoid unnecessary errors\n- Implement proper error handling for removal operations\n\n### Power system problems (continued)\n- Boiler at x=24.5,y=17.0 reports no fuel despite available coal\n- Assembling machine at x=26.5,y=20.5 still not receiving power\n- Steam engine missing from power plant setup\n\n### Production issues (continued)\n- Multiple furnaces reporting no ingredients despite available resources\n- Assembling machine cannot produce stone walls due to missing stone bricks\n- Inserters frequently stuck waiting for source items\n\n### Fluid system recommendations\n- Verify all pipe connections in the boiler setup\n- Check water supply from offshore pump through the pipe network\n- Ensure proper fluid system connections before placing steam engines\n\nThe agent should focus on:\n1. Completing the power plant by properly placing the steam engine\n2. Fixing resource flow issues between mining drills and furnaces\n3. Verifying all connections in production chains\n4. Implementing proper error handling for placement/removal operations"}
