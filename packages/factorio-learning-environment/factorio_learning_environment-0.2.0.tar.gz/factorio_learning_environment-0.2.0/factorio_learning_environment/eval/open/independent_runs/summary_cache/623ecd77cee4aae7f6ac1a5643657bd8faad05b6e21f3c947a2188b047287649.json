{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0) supplying iron ore to a wooden chest at position (x=-12.5, y=-54.5).\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-19.0, y=-65.0) supplied with iron ore from the chest at (x=-12.5, y=-54.5).\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-21.0, y=-62.0) supplied with iron ore from the chest at (x=-12.5, y=-54.5).\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) supplied with iron ore from the chest at (x=1.5, y=0.5).\n- Burner Inserters at positions (x=-20.5, y=-66.5) and (x=-17.5, y=-64.5) moving iron plates to a wooden chest at position (x=-16.5, y=-64.5).\n\n### Copper Ore Mining Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-23.0, y=-68.0) extracting copper ore and depositing it into a wooden chest at position (x=-23.5, y=-69.5).\n- Transport belts connecting the mining drill to the chest.\n\n### Coal Mining and Distribution System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=53.0, y=-83.0) extracting coal and depositing it into a wooden chest at position (x=52.5, y=-84.5).\n- Transport belts and inserters distributing coal to various furnaces and drills.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Transport Belt Blockage\n- Ensure that transport belts are clear of any blockages to allow continuous mining operations. Clear the belt at position (x=-14.5, y=-54.5) to continue mining.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source items are available for inserters to pick up. Check inventory and supply chains to avoid idle inserters.\n\n### Fuel Source Full Warnings\n- Regularly check and manage the fuel levels in mining drills and furnaces to prevent overfilling and ensure continuous operation."}
