{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=-1.5, y=24.0)\nConsists of:\n- **Boiler** at position (x=-1.5, y=24.0), currently out of fuel.\n- **Steam Engine** at position (x=5.5, y=21.5), not connected to power network and lacking input liquid.\n- **Offshore Pump** at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5), working status, providing water.\n- **PipeGroup** connecting the offshore pump to the boiler, with water flowing through.\n- **PipeGroup** connecting the boiler to the steam engine, currently empty.\n\n### Copper Plate Production at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0), currently working with a fuel inventory of coal and producing copper plates.\n\n### Lab Structure\n- **Lab** with input for automation science packs, currently without power.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Type Conversion Errors\n- Ensure that when converting variables to float, the input is a string or a real number, not an object like 'ModelPrivateAttr'.\n\n### Attribute Errors\n- Verify that the attributes being accessed, such as `tile_dimensions`, exist for the object in question.\n\n### Connection Errors\n- Ensure that all required items are available in the inventory before attempting to connect entities, such as pipes or small electric poles.\n- Check that the entities you are trying to connect exist and are correctly positioned.\n\n### Inventory Management Errors\n- Keep track of inventory levels to ensure enough resources are available for crafting and refueling operations.\n- Ensure that the correct items are available in the inventory when attempting to craft or insert items into structures.\n\n### Name Errors\n- Verify that all variable names are correctly defined and match the intended variables. For example, ensure `copper_cable_needed_for_poles` is defined before use.\n\n### Entity Placement and Extraction Errors\n- Confirm that entities like stone furnaces are correctly placed and contain the expected items before attempting to extract resources.\n- Ensure that the entities being referenced for insertion or extraction operations exist and are in the expected state."}
