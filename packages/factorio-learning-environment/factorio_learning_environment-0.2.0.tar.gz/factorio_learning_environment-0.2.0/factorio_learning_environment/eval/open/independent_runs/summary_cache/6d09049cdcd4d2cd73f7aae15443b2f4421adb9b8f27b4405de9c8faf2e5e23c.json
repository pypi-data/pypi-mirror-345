{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-13.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (4.0, -60.0) with a drop position at (4.5, -58.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (4.5, -58.5) storing iron ore\n- Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -48.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates\n- Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates\n- Stone Furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates\n\nThe facility is responsible for extracting iron ore, storing it temporarily, and then smelting it into iron plates using stone furnaces.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Full Chest Warning\n- Ensure to regularly empty the chest at position (4.5, -58.5) to prevent the burner mining drill from halting operations due to a full drop position.\n\n#### Furnace Ingredient Shortage\n- Maintain a steady supply of iron ore to the furnaces at positions (-15.0, -48.0), (-13.0, -48.0), and (-11.0, -48.0) to avoid the \"no ingredients to smelt\" warning.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n#### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided logs.\n\n#### Important Variables\n- `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the current inventory of items such as 'wooden-chest', 'coal', 'iron-ore', 'iron-plate', and 'iron-gear-wheel'.\n- `burner_mining_drill_status`: EntityStatus - Monitors the operational status of the burner mining drill.\n- `furnace_status`: EntityStatus - Monitors the operational status of the stone furnaces."}
