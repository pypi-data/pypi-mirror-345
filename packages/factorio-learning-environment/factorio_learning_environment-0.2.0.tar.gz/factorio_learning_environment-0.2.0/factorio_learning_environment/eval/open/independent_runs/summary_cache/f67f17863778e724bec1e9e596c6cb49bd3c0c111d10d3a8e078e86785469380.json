{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) which extracts iron ore and deposits it into the chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5) which stores the extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5) that transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0) which is intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities Too Far\n- Ensure you are within the maximum placement distance (10 units) from the target position before attempting to place an entity. Move closer to the desired location to place entities successfully.\n\n### Errors when Placing Inserters with Collision\n- Before placing an inserter, check for potential collisions with existing entities. Consider adjusting the spacing, changing the direction, or selecting a different reference position to avoid placement issues.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Setup\n- Verify that inserters are correctly aligned and fueled to ensure they can transfer items between entities. Regularly check and adjust inserter positions to maintain a functional setup.\n\n### Errors with Empty or Low Inventory\n- Monitor the inventory levels of chests and ensure they have sufficient resources to prevent disruptions in production. Regularly refuel entities and manage inventory to maintain efficient operations."}
