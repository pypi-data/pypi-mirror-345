{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-20, -70)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -70.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-18.0, -70.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) connected to transport belts and a wooden chest at position (-23.5, -69.5) containing iron ore and copper ore.\n- Transport belts connecting the mining drill to the furnaces.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage Facility at Position (-16.5, -64.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -65.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-16.5, -64.5) containing iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-17.5, -64.5) transferring items from the furnace to the chest.\n- Transport belts facilitating the movement of items between the entities.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Facility at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) currently out of fuel.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-12.5, -54.5) containing iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5) transferring items from the mining drill to the chest.\n- Transport belts connecting the mining drill to the chest.\n\n### Central Smelting Facility at Position (0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5) containing coal, iron ore, and iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) transferring items between chests.\n\n### Belt Networks\n- Multiple belt groups facilitating the movement of resources between various entities across the map.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing transport belts\n- Ensure that the target position for placing a transport belt is clear of any existing entities. Remove any obstructions before attempting to place a new belt.\n\n### Errors with full chests\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are full to prevent mining drills from halting operations due to lack of space.\n\n### Errors with fuel management\n- Ensure that all burner mining drills have sufficient fuel to operate. Regularly refuel drills to maintain continuous operation."}
