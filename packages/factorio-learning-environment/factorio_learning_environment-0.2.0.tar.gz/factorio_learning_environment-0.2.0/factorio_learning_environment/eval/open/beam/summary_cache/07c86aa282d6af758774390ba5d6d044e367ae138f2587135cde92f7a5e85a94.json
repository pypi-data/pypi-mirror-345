{"content": "Based on the execution results and errors encountered, here's my analysis of the Factorio AI interaction:\n\nKey Findings:\n1. Successful Operations:\n- Placing furnaces works well when within range (Position(x=0, y=0) and Position(x=2, y=0))\n- Extracting items from furnaces is reliable\n- Crafting iron gear wheels works (2 iron plates \u2192 1 gear wheel)\n- Checking inventory and furnace status functions work properly\n\n2. Common Errors:\n- Distance limitations: Cannot place entities beyond 10 units from player position\n- Resource availability: Cannot insert items we don't have in inventory\n- Need to move_to() before performing actions\n\n3. Successful Patterns:\n```python\n# Pattern 1: Safe entity placement\nmove_to(target_position)\nentity = place_entity(Prototype.Entity, position=target_position)\n\n# Pattern 2: Safe item extraction\nif entity.furnace_result.get('item-name', 0) > 0:\n    move_to(entity.position)\n    extract_item(Prototype.Item, entity.position, quantity=amount)\n\n# Pattern 3: Inventory-aware crafting\navailable = inspect_inventory()[Prototype.Resource]\ncraft_amount = min(desired_amount, available // recipe_cost)\n```\n\n4. Tips for Future:\n- Always check inventory before attempting to insert/craft\n- Move within range before any entity interaction\n- Extract products before adding new resources\n- Keep track of furnace states to optimize production\n- Use get_entities() to monitor production status\n\n5. Recommended Workflow:\n1. Check current inventory/status\n2. Move to target location\n3. Perform action (place/insert/extract)\n4. Verify result\n5. Update production as needed\n\nThis analysis should help improve future interactions with the Factorio AI API.", "summary_range": "[1-192]"}
