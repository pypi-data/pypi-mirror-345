{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nLocated at positions around x=-15.0, y=-50.0, this facility includes:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) which extracts iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) and (x=-15.5, y=-48.5) used for temporary storage of extracted resources.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0) which processes iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserters**:\n  - At position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5), facilitating the transfer of resources between the mining drill and the furnace.\n  - At position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5), assisting in moving items from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-46.5) for storing finished iron plates and excess iron ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items without having them in inventory\n- Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. For example, attempting to insert coal into a mining drill without having coal in the inventory will result in an error.\n\n### Inserter waiting for source items\n- Ensure that the source entity has items available for the inserter to pick up. If the inserter is waiting for source items, check the supply chain to ensure resources are being delivered to the source entity.\n\n### Inserter waiting for space in destination\n- Make sure the destination entity has enough space to accept items from the inserter. If the destination is full, the inserter will be unable to transfer items, causing a bottleneck in production.\n\n### Furnace belt at drop position is blocked\n- Ensure that the belt or entity at the drop position of an inserter is not blocked. This ensures smooth transfer of items and prevents production delays."}
