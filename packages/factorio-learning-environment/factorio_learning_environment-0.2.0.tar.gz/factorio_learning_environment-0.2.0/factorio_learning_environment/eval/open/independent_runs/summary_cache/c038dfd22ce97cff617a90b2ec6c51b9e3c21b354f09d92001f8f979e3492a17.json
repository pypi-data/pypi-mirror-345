{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(10, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore pump (position -9.5, 24.5)\n- Boiler (position not specified)\n- Steam engine (position not specified)\n\n### Copper plate factory at position(1, 1)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position 1.0, 1.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n- Wooden chest (position 3.5, 1.5) containing iron plates\n- Burner inserter (position 8.5, 1.5) which is out of fuel\n- Stone furnace (position 10.0, 1.0) with out of fuel status\n- Wooden chest (position 3.5, 3.5) containing iron plates\n- Wooden chest (position 3.5, 5.5) with no inventory\n\n### Electricity group at position(50.5, 49.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Small electric poles at various positions including (50.5, 49.5), (51.5, 49.5), (53.5, 49.5), etc.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing electric poles\n- Ensure that the target location for placing electric poles is clear of any obstructions and that the terrain is suitable for placement. If the area is blocked or unplaceable (e.g., water), choose a different location.\n\n### Errors when attempting to retrieve entities\n- Verify that the entity you are trying to access exists at the specified position. If you receive an error stating that no entity of the specified type is found, double-check the coordinates and ensure that the entity has been placed correctly.\n\n### Repeated errors in electric pole placement\n- The same errors regarding the inability to place electric poles due to obstructions have been encountered multiple times. Consistently check for nearby entities or terrain issues before attempting to place poles.\n\n### Errors related to fuel and power\n- Ensure that all entities requiring fuel or power, such as furnaces and inserters, have the necessary resources to operate. Regularly check inventory levels and supply chains to maintain functionality."}
