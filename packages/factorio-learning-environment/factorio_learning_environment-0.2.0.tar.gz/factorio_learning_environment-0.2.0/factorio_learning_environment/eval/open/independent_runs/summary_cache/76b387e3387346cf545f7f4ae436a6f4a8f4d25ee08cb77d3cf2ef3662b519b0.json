This structure was employed for additional iron plate production to support subsequent crafting needs.\n\n\u2022 \u2003Copper Smelting Furnace at Position(\u201327.0, \u201360.0)  \n\u2003\u2002Consists of a furnace entity used to convert copper ore and coal into copper plates. This facility provided the necessary copper plates to address shortages for downstream recipes.\n\nNote: Multiple attempts were made to deploy a Lab (intended as a research facility for supplying Automation Science Packs) at Position(0.5, 2.5). However, due to missing inventory items and resource shortfalls in the production chain, no Lab structure has been successfully placed on the map.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 \u2003Incorrect get_entities Usage  \n\u2003\u2002\u2013 When calling get_entities, avoid using unsupported keyword arguments (such as \u201cradius\u201d) or extra positional parameters.  \n\u2003\u2002\u2013 Always verify the function\u2019s signature to ensure that the number and type of passed parameters match its definition.\n\n\u2022 \u2003Lab Placement and Iteration Errors  \n\u2003\u2002\u2013 Before attempting to place a Lab, ensure that the Lab item is available in the inventory.  \n\u2003\u2002\u2013 Validate that API calls returning entity lists yield an iterable (or default to an empty list) instead of None so that subsequent iterations do not fail.\n\n\u2022 \u2003Lab Crafting Failures Due to Insufficient Sub-Ingredients  \n\u2003\u2002\u2013 Confirm that all required intermediate ingredients (for example, iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, and copper-cables) are sufficiently available before initiating Lab crafting.  \n\u2003\u2002\u2013 Strengthen your resource conversion chain (including smelting and intermediate crafting processes) to meet the recipe requirements, thus avoiding missing ingredient errors during Lab production."}
