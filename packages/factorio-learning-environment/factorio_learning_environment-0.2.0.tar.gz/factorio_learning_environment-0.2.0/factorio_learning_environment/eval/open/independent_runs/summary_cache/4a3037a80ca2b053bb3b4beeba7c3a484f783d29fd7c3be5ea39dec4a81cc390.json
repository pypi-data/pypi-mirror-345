{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting\nThis setup is designed to mine iron ore and smelt it into iron plates.\nConsists of the following entities:\n*   Burner mining drill at position (x=28.0, y=84.0) feeding a Stone furnace at position (x=28.0, y=86.0)\n*   Burner mining drill at position (x=30.0, y=84.0) feeding a Stone furnace at position (x=30.0, y=86.0)\n*   Burner mining drill at position (x=32.0, y=84.0) feeding a Stone furnace at position (x=32.0, y=86.0)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Fueling Failures and Logic Errors\n*   The agent repeatedly failed to fuel existing burner mining drills and stone furnaces across multiple steps (32-39).\n*   Step 32 indicated assertion errors during the processing of each individual entity, suggesting a problem within the fueling logic for each item.\n*   Steps 33-39 showed assertion errors related to entity count mismatches after the fueling attempt (`Logic error: Entity count mismatch. Handled: 0, Failed: 0, Total Found: 6`). This points to a flaw in how"}
