{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation Facility (Updated)\n- **Offshore Pump** at (-11.5, -3.5) - Now connected but not receiving power\n- **Boiler** at (-8.5, 0.0) - Operational with coal fuel, producing steam\n- **Pipe Network** (system 15004):\n  - Connected pipes between pump and boiler\n  - Status: WORKING (fluid flowing)\n\n### New Power Plant (Updated)\n- **Boiler** at (35.5, 47.0) - Fueled with coal but no water input\n- **Steam Engine** at (38.5, 46.5) - Connected to boiler but not operational\n- **Pipe Network**:\n  - Pipes connecting boiler to steam engine (system 14475)\n  - Status: EMPTY (no fluid present)\n\n### Oil Processing Facility (Updated)\n- **Pumpjack** at (17.5, 40.5) - Now powered but not extracting\n- **Oil Refinery** at (24.5, 44.5) - Now powered but missing input resources\n- **Chemical Plant** at (40.5, 40.5) - Newly placed, powered but missing resources\n  - Recipe set to plastic bar production\n  - Requires coal and petroleum gas\n\n### Coal Mining Operation (Unchanged)\n- **Electric Mining Drill** at (34.5, 20.5) - Unpowered\n- **Transport Belt System** moving coal (status: WORKING)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Power System Issues (Updated)\n- Offshore pump placement failures (44.0,43.0 and 49.0,48.0) - Verify inventory before placement\n- Chemical plant power assertion failures - Implement proper power network validation\n- ElectricityGroup attribute errors - Use correct API methods for power checks\n\n### Construction Problems (Updated)\n- Inserter placement failures (40.0,39.0) - Clear target area completely\n- Offshore pump connection issues (-9.5,-1.5) - Validate fluid connection points\n- Entity placement inventory checks - Track entity counts before placement\n\n### System Validation (New)\n- Power connection verification - Implement proper power network checks\n- Fluid system validation - Check all connection points are unobstructed\n- Recipe validation - Verify required resources are available\n\n### Best Practices (Updated)\n1. Always verify inventory before placement operations\n2. Implement complete clearance checks for all constructions\n3. Validate power connections before asserting operational status\n4. Check fluid system integrity after construction\n5. Verify recipe requirements before setting production"}
