{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll generate a report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing Setup at (-82.0, -80.5)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0)\n- Transport belt at (41.5, -80.5) facing RIGHT\n- Burner inserter at (42.5, -80.5) facing DOWN\n- Stone furnace at (43.0, -82.0) facing UP\n\nCurrent status: The structure is partially operational but has some issues:\n- Mining drill is waiting for space in destination\n- Belt contains 5 coal\n- Inserter is waiting for source items\n- Furnace has no ingredients to smelt\nAll components have adequate fuel (coal) supplies.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Collision Errors\n- Before placing entities, check for existing items or entities that might block placement\n- When placing inserters near belts and furnaces, ensure proper spacing and clear adjacent tiles\n- Consider removing items on ground that block entity placement\n\n### Belt-Furnace Connection Errors\n- Cannot connect belts directly to furnaces - must use inserters as intermediaries\n- Ensure proper orientation of inserters between belts and furnaces\n- Verify the pickup and drop positions of inserters align with source and destination entities\n\n### Belt Blockage Issues\n- Regularly clear blocked belts to maintain flow\n- Ensure proper item handling chain from source to destination\n- Monitor belt inventory to prevent overflow\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nFunctions:\n- place_entity(): Places entities at specific coordinates\n- place_entity_next_to(): Places entities adjacent to existing ones with specified spacing\n- connect_entities(): Creates connections between entities (notably cannot connect belts directly to furnaces)\n\nImportant Variables:\n- Mining drill fuel: Dictionary tracking coal quantity\n- Belt inventory: Dictionary tracking items on belt\n- Inserter fuel: Dictionary tracking inserter fuel levels\n- Furnace fuel: Dictionary tracking furnace fuel levels"}
