{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo new structures have been successfully placed on the map. The agent made multiple attempts to supply a Lab at (0.5, 2.5)\u2014a structure intended for research via Automation Science Packs\u2014but none of these attempts succeeded due to inventory shortages and crafting resource issues. Although existing furnaces (an alternative furnace at (5.0, 5.0) used for iron smelting and a copper furnace at (\u201327.0, \u201360.0) used for copper plate production) were identified and utilized, they were not newly created by the agent.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 API usage errors with get_entities:\n\u2003\u2013 Avoid passing unsupported keyword arguments (such as \u201cradius\u201d) or using incorrect positional arguments.\n\u2003\u2013 Always check the function signature and validate its return value (handle cases where it may return None before iterating).\n\n\u2022 Lab placement and crafting issues:\n\u2003\u2013 Confirm that the required Lab item is present in inventory before attempting placement.\n\u2003\u2013 Validate that any list of returned entities (e.g. labs) is not None before iterating to filter or process them.\n\n\u2022 Resource prerequisites for Lab crafting:\n\u2003\u2013 Ensure all sub-ingredients (for example, iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, and copper-cables) are available before initiating Lab crafting.\n\u2003\u2013 Synchronize resource production\u2014such as smelting iron or copper\u2014to meet both direct and intermediate requirements, thereby avoiding shortages during crafting attempts."}
