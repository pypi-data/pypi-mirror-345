{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Collection System at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0)\n- Burner Inserter at position (-16.5, -51.5) connected to the mining drill\n- Wooden Chest at position (-15.5, -51.5) receiving items from the inserter\n- Burner Inserter at position (-14.5, -51.5) transferring items from the chest\n- Wooden Chest at position (-13.5, -51.5) collecting items from the second inserter\n\n### Iron Plate Production System at Position (62.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (62.0, -53.0)\n- Burner Inserter at position (63.5, -52.5) intended to feed the furnace\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities due to obstructions\n- Ensure that the intended location for placing an entity is clear of obstructions before attempting placement. Repeated failures to place a burner inserter at (61.0, -53.0) indicate that the area is obstructed.\n\n### Errors due to missing items in inventory\n- Before attempting to place an entity, verify that the required item is present in the inventory. The error when trying to place a wooden chest without having one in inventory highlights this issue.\n\n### Errors related to inserters waiting for source items\n- Ensure that the source items are available for inserters to function properly. Inserters waiting for source items indicate a potential bottleneck or misconfiguration in the supply chain."}
