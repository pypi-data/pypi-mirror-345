{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (20.5, -4.0)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (22.5, -7.5)\n- Boiler at Position (20.5, -4.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (4.5, -10.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting various components for steam and water flow\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at Position (5.0, 5.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-11.0, 20.0) with a connected Wooden Chest at Position (-11.5, 18.5) storing iron ore\n- Stone Furnace at Position (5.0, 5.0) processing copper ore into copper plates\n\n### Copper Cable Factory\nConsists of:\n- Assembling Machine at Position (10.5, 0.5) with Inserter feeding copper plates into it\n- BeltGroup connecting the furnace at Position (5.0, 5.0) to the Assembling Machine at Position (10.5, 0.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0) and another at Position (2.0, 0.0) with no iron ore available to smelt\n\n### Storage and Transport System\nConsists of:\n- Wooden Chest at Position (-3.5, 0.5) and another at Position (-3.5, 2.5) for storing items\n- Inserters at various positions for moving items between chests and belts\n- BeltGroup transporting items between various points\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Missing Resources\n- Ensure sufficient resources are available in the inventory to supply to furnaces and assembling machines. For example, the furnace requires iron ore, and the assembling machine requires copper plates.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Position inserters correctly and ensure they have access to source items to avoid waiting status. Check the connections between inserters and their source/destination entities.\n\n### Assembling Machine Ingredient Shortage\n- Make sure the assembling machine has all necessary ingredients to produce the desired item. For instance, the assembling machine requires copper plates to create copper cables.\n\n### Furnace No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to process. Check that iron ore is available for iron plate production."}
