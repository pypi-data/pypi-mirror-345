{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-16.0, -51.0) with a drop position at (-16.5, -52.5). This drill is currently out of fuel and is extracting iron ore.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-14.0, -49.0). This furnace is fueled with coal and has produced iron plates, but currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied or incorrect locations\n- Ensure that the target location for placing entities such as Burner Inserters, Wooden Chests, Stone Furnaces, and Transport Belts is not already occupied by another entity. Check the map and clear the area before attempting to place an entity.\n\n### Errors due to undefined variables in code\n- Ensure that all variables used in scripts are properly defined before use. For example, the variable `ore_furnace` was not defined, causing a `NameError`. Double-check variable names and ensure they match the intended entities or objects.\n\n### Errors when extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move closer to the target entity from which you want to extract items before attempting to clear or extract items.\n\n### Fuel and Resource Management Warnings\n- Regularly check and refuel entities like the Burner Mining Drill to ensure continuous operation. Also, ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to process, avoiding warnings like \"no ingredients to smelt.\"\n\nBy addressing these errors and warnings, the agent can improve efficiency and reduce interruptions in the production process."}
