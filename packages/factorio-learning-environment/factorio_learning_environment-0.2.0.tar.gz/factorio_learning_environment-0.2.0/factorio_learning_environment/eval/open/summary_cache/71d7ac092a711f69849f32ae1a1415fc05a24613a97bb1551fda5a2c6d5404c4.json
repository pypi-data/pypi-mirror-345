{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron ore mining and smelting setup at position around (16.0, 71.0)\nConsists of the following connected entities forming a compact iron processing structure:\n- Burner mining drill at position (16.0, 71.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden chest at position (16.5, 72.5) collecting iron ore from the mining drill.\n- Stone furnace at position (18.0, 73.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner inserter at position (19.5, 72.5) feeding coal into the furnace (newly placed input inserter).\n- Inserter at position (16.5, 73.5) intended to feed iron ore into the furnace (input inserter).\n- Burner inserter at position (18.5, 74.5) extracting iron plates from the furnace (output inserter).\n- Wooden chest at position (18.5, 75.5) collecting iron plates from the output inserter.\n- Small electric poles positioned nearby to provide electricity to inserters (positions include (17.5, 71.5), (19.5, 73.5), and (17.5, 74.5)).\n\nThis structure is designed to mine iron ore, transfer it into a furnace for smelting, and collect the produced iron plates in a chest, with inserters handling the material movement and electric poles supplying power.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Incorrect direction argument when placing entities\n- When placing entities that require a direction parameter, ensure the direction argument is of the correct Direction enum type rather than a raw integer or other type. For example, use Direction.DOWN instead of Dir.DOWN.value.\n\n### Placement failures due to collisions or invalid terrain\n- When placing entities next to others, collisions with existing entities (e.g., mining drills) or unbuildable terrain (such as water) can cause placement to fail.\n- To mitigate this, increase spacing between entities, change the direction of placement, or select a different reference position for placement.\n- Always verify the target tile is free and buildable before attempting placement.\n\n### Retrieving entities that do not exist at specified positions\n- Attempts to get entities at positions where none exist will raise exceptions.\n- Confirm the entity was successfully placed before trying to retrieve it.\n- Use safe checks or queries to verify entity presence at a location prior to operations.\n\n### Connection errors between entities (e.g., electric poles)\n- Failures when connecting entities with poles may be due to incorrect references or missing expected fields.\n- Ensure the entities to be connected exist and are correctly referenced.\n- Validate the connection logic and handle cases where entities might not support direct connection.\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nNo user-defined functions have been defined by the agent so far."}
