{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\nConsists of:\n- Boiler at position (-5.5, 24.0)\n- Steam Engine at position (-1.5, 24.5)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the boiler, steam engine, and offshore pump, with various pipe positions including (-8.5, 23.5), (-9.5, 23.5), (-7.5, 23.5), and others.\n- Small electric poles at positions (0.5, 21.5), (-1.5, 26.5), (-0.5, 26.5), (0.5, 26.5), and others for electricity distribution.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (6.0, -62.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (6.0, -62.0)\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) waiting for source items\n- Wooden Chest at position (6.5, -59.5) for storing produced items\n\n### Research Lab\n- Lab with input for 'automation-science-pack', currently not in progress\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the inserter has access to the source items it needs to operate. Check the supply chain feeding into the inserter to ensure it is not interrupted.\n\n### Boiler Out of Fuel\n- Regularly check the fuel levels of boilers to ensure continuous operation. Automate fuel supply if possible to prevent manual refueling errors.\n\n### Furnace No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Ensure that the furnace is supplied with the necessary raw materials for smelting. Automate the supply chain to maintain a steady flow of ingredients."}
