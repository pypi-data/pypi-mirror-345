{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position(-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position -15.0, -50.0) with coal as fuel and currently operational, but has a warning indicating that the chest at drop position (-14.5, -48.5) is full.\n\n### Wooden Chest at position(-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest (position -14.5, -48.5) containing iron ore.\n\n### Stone Furnace at position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace (position 0.0, 0.0) currently has coal as fuel but is showing warnings for having no ingredients to smelt and that the furnace result is full.\n\n### Wooden Chest at position(2.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest (position 2.5, 0.5) containing iron ore and iron plates.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n- **Errors related to full chests**: The Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) cannot drop off resources because the chest at (-14.5, -48.5) is full. To avoid this, regularly check and empty chests to ensure they have capacity for incoming resources.\n  \n- **Errors when the furnace has no ingredients**: The Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) is reporting no ingredients to smelt. Ensure that the furnace is supplied with the necessary raw materials to function effectively.\n\n- **Errors related to furnace results being full**: The Stone Furnace is also indicating that its result inventory is full. Regularly check the output of furnaces and empty them to maintain production flow.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- **Utility Functions**: None defined or invoked in the current execution steps.\n\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `coal`: int\n  - `iron-ore`: int\n  - `wood`: int\n  - `furnace_status`: str\n  - `chest_status`: str"}
