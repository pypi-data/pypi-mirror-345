{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) with coal fuel, extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) serving as an intermediary storage.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -48.5) transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-12.0, -48.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-10.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-10.0, -48.0) with coal fuel, converting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-8.5, -47.5) transferring iron plates from the furnace to a wooden chest.\n\n### Storage and Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -46.5) storing iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-7.5, -47.5) intended for storing iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-14.5, -47.5) transferring iron ore between chests.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Extracting Items from Non-Existent Entities\n- Ensure that the target entity exists and contains the required items before attempting to extract. Verify the entity's position and inventory before executing the extraction command.\n\n### Errors when Inserting Items without Available Inventory\n- Check your inventory to ensure you have the required items before attempting to insert them into another entity. Maintain an adequate supply of necessary resources.\n\n### Errors when Inserters are Blocked or Waiting\n- Ensure that the destination for inserters is not blocked and has space to receive items. Regularly monitor and clear any blockages to maintain smooth operations.\n\n### Errors when Extracting Iron Plates from Non-Existent Chest\n- Verify the existence of the wooden chest at position (-7.5, -47.5) before attempting to extract iron plates. Ensure that the chest is correctly positioned and contains the expected items.\n\n### Errors when Attempting to Insert without Sufficient Resources\n- Confirm that you have the necessary resources in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities. Regularly check inventory levels to avoid such errors."}
