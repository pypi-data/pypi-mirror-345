{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-4.5, 23.0)\nConsists of boiler (position -4.5, 23.0), steam engine (position -0.5, -9.5), and offshore pump (position -7.5, 25.5). The boiler is currently out of fuel, and the steam engine is not connected to a power network.\n\n### Copper plate factory at position(0.0, 0.0) and (5.0, 5.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position 0.0, 0.0) and stone furnace (position 5.0, 5.0). Both furnaces are currently without ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Lab at position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of a lab (position 0.0, 0.0) that is currently not powered.\n\n### Pipe network\nConsists of multiple pipe groups that facilitate fluid transport. The pipe groups are located at various positions including (-8.5, -7.5), (-4.5, 19.5), (-14.5, 23.5), (-18.5, 25.5), (-20.5, 29.5), and (-21.5, 28.5). Some pipe groups are full, while others are empty.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to undefined entities\n- Ensure that all necessary classes and entities are properly defined and imported before use. In this case, the 'Entity' class was not defined.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors related to power connections\n- Check that all power-generating entities are connected to a power network to avoid warnings about being not connected."}
