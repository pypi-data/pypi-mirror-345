{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Transport System at Position (x=41.0, y=-82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0) connected to a wooden chest at position (x=40.5, y=-83.5) and a burner inserter at position (x=41.5, y=-83.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=40.5, y=-83.5) and another at position (x=42.5, y=-83.5), storing coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=41.5, y=-83.5) moving coal from the chest at (x=40.5, y=-83.5) to the chest at (x=42.5, y=-83.5).\n- Additional Burner Inserter at position (x=41.5, y=-80.5) transferring coal from the mining drill to a chest at position (x=41.5, y=-79.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=41.5, y=-79.5) storing coal.\n- BeltGroup transporting coal from position (x=42.5, y=-83.5) to position (x=44.5, y=-83.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) processing iron ore into iron plates.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=2.0, y=0.0) processing iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Operations\n- Ensure that inserters have access to source items. If an inserter is waiting for source items, check the supply chain to ensure that items are being delivered to the inserter's pickup position.\n\n### Errors with Inventory Management\n- Regularly check the inventory of chests and furnaces to ensure they are not full or empty, which can halt production processes.\n\n### Errors with Entity Placement\n- Verify that entities are placed correctly and are connected to the intended targets, such as chests or belts, to ensure efficient operation and resource flow."}
