{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\u2022 No new structures have been successfully created. Repeated attempts to craft and place a Lab at (0.5, 2.5) did not succeed\u2014no Lab is present on the map. Although operations involved interacting with an alternative furnace at Position(x=5.0, y=5.0) and a copper furnace at Position(x=-27.0, y=-60.0) for smelting, those were pre\u2010existing facilities used during resource processing rather than newly built structures. The final state confirms that no entities (and hence no structures) have been placed by the agent.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 API Call Errors with get_entities:\n\u2003\u2013 Using an unexpected keyword argument (e.g. \u2018radius\u2019) resulted in a TypeError.\n\u2003\u2013 Passing positional arguments that do not match the API signature also led to errors.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Tip: Always verify the expected parameter format (positional versus keyword) of get_entities before calling it.\n\n\u2022 Lab Placement and Iteration Failures:\n\u2003\u2013 Attempts to place a Lab failed because no Lab was found in the inventory.\n\u2003\u2013 Iterating over a result that was None (instead of an empty list) caused a TypeError.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Tip: Check inventory for required objects prior to placement and validate returned collections to avoid iterating over None.\n\n\u2022 Lab Crafting and Resource Shortages:\n\u2003\u2013 Crafting errors pointed to missing sub-ingredients (such as iron-gear-wheels and components needed for electronic-circuits, including copper-cable and copper-plate).\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Tip: Ensure that the complete production chain is available\u2014produce all prerequisite items in sufficient quantities before attempting to craft the Lab.\n\n(Note: No utility functions have been defined by the agent, so no NAMESPACE section is included.)"}
