{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Offshore pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump (position -9.5, 24.5) connected to a pipe group.\n\n### Electricity group\nConsists of:\n- Electricity group (id=230582) with poles at various positions including (41.5, 25.5), (25.5, 27.5), (29.5, 27.5), etc.\n\n### Copper plate factory\nConsists of:\n- Furnace (position 1.0, 1.0) with coal as fuel and producing copper plates.\n- Chest (position 3.5, 1.5) storing iron plates.\n- Lab (position 6.5, 1.5) currently without power.\n- Furnace (position 10.0, 1.0) out of fuel and processing iron ore.\n- Burner inserter (position 8.5, 1.5) with no fuel.\n- Chest (position 3.5, 3.5) storing iron plates.\n- Chest (position 3.5, 5.5) currently empty.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing electric poles\n- Ensure the target location for placing electric poles is clear of other entities or terrain that cannot be built upon (e.g., water).\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities\n- Verify that the entity you are trying to retrieve (e.g., steam engine) exists at the specified position before attempting to access it. If it does not exist, check your previous placements or the map for the correct location.\n\n### Repeated errors\n- The same errors regarding electric pole placements and entity retrieval have occurred multiple times. Consistently check the area for obstructions and ensure entities are placed correctly before attempting to interact with them."}
