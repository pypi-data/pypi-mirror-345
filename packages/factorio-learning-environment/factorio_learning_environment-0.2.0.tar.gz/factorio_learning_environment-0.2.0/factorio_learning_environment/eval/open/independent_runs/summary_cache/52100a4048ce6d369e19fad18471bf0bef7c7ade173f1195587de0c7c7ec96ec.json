{"content": "Based on the logs, I'll generate a comprehensive report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Smelting System (around y=-81)\nConsists of:\n- Two stone furnaces at positions (45.0, -81.0) and (47.0, -81.0)\n- Two burner inserters at (45.5, -82.5) and (47.5, -82.5) that output to wooden chests\n- Output wooden chests at (45.5, -83.5) and (47.5, -83.5) containing iron plates\n\n### Coal Mining System (around y=-82)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0) mining coal\n- Two iron chests at (41.5, -84.5) and (41.5, -83.5) storing coal\n- Coal storage wooden chest at (49.5, -80.5)\n\n### Input Distribution System (around y=-79)\nConsists of:\n- Input wooden chest at (46.5, -77.5) containing iron ore\n- Burner inserter at (46.5, -78.5) for loading\n- Transport belts at (46.5, -79.5), (45.5, -79.5), and (47.5, -79.5)\n\n### Storage System\n- Storage chest at (49.5, -79.5) containing coal and iron plates\n- Various wooden chests at (45.5, -84.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Conflicts\n- Before placing entities, check if the target location is clear of other entities\n- Ensure proper spacing between inserters, belts, and other structures\n- When rebuilding systems, remove conflicting entities first\n\n### Resource Management\n- Ensure required items are in inventory before placement (e.g., splitters)\n- Monitor fuel levels in burner devices to prevent \"out of fuel\" warnings\n\n### System Design\n- Plan proper spacing for inserters relative to belts and furnaces\n- Consider entity dimensions when planning layouts (e.g., furnaces are 2x2)\n- Ensure output paths are clear and have valid destinations to prevent blocking\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nFunctions:\n- place_entity(): Places entities on the map. Fails when target location is occupied or required item is missing from inventory.\n\nImportant Variables:\n- center_belt: TransportBelt (position around 46.5, -79.5)\n- left_belt: TransportBelt (position around 45.5, -79.5)\n- right_belt: TransportBelt (position around 47.5, -79.5)\n- left_inserter: BurnerInserter (placement attempts around 45.0-45.5, -80.0 to -80.5)"}
