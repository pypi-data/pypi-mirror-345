{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace (position 0.0, 0.0) which is currently working and has coal as fuel and produces iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest (position 2.5, 0.5) storing iron plates (100 units).\n  \n### Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position -15.0, -50.0) which is currently out of fuel and has a wooden chest at its drop position.\n- Wooden Chest (position -14.5, -48.5) which is full of iron ore (205 units).\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n- **Errors when refueling the Burner Mining Drill while it is out of fuel**\n  - Ensure that the Burner Mining Drill has enough fuel before attempting to refuel. Check the inventory and the status of the drill to confirm it can accept fuel.\n\n- **Errors related to the wooden chest being full**\n  - Regularly check the inventory of the wooden chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) and empty it to allow the Burner Mining Drill to continue mining.\n\n- **Errors when feeding iron ore into the Stone Furnace**\n  - Ensure that the Stone Furnace has enough capacity to accept iron ore and that it is not already full of products. Monitor the furnace's status to avoid feeding it when it is unable to process.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions Defined:**\n  - None invoked in the current steps.\n\n- **Important Variables Assigned:**\n  - `iron_ore`: int (3141)\n  - `iron_plate`: int (100)\n  - `coal`: int (5)\n  - `wood`: int (4)"}
