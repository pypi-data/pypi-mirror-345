{"content": "The error indicates that the furnace does not require a recipe to smelt copper ore into copper plates, as this process is automatic for furnaces in Factorio. Let's focus on ensuring that the furnace has the necessary resources and is functioning correctly.\n\n# Step 1: Ensure the furnace has the required resources\n- **Coal**: Make sure there is enough coal in the furnace to keep it running.\n- **Copper Ore**: Ensure that copper ore is present in the furnace for smelting.\n\n# Step 2: Verify the furnace's operation\n- Check if the furnace is actively smelting. The furnace should automatically process copper ore into copper plates when both fuel and ore are present.\n\n# Step 3: Allow time for smelting\n- Wait for a sufficient period to allow the furnace to process the copper ore into copper plates. This can be done using a sleep function.\n\n```python\n# Ensure the furnace has enough coal and copper ore\ncurrent_furnace_inventory = inspect_inventory(new_furnace)\nrequired_coal = 5\nrequired_copper_ore = 5\n\nif current_furnace_inventory.get(Prototype.Coal, 0) < required_coal:\n    insert_item(Prototype.Coal, new_furnace, quantity=(required_coal - current_furnace_inventory.get(Prototype.Coal, 0)))\n\nif current_furnace_inventory.get(Prototype.CopperOre, 0) < required_copper_ore:\n    insert_item(Prototype.CopperOre, new_furnace, quantity=(required_copper_ore - current_furnace_inventory.get(Prototype.CopperOre, 0)))\n\n# Allow time for smelting\nsleep(20)\n\n# Step 4: Re-inspect the furnace for copper plates\nfurnace_inventory_post_smelting = inspect_inventory(new_furnace)\nprint(\"Furnace inventory after smelting: \", furnace_inventory_post_smelting)\n\n# Step 5: Extract copper plates if available\ncopper_plates = furnace_inventory_post_smelting.get(Prototype.CopperPlate, 0)\nif copper_plates > 0:\n    extract_item(Prototype.CopperPlate, new_furnace.position, quantity=copper_plates)\nelse:\n    print(\"No copper plates available for extraction. Ensure the furnace is functioning correctly.\")\n```\n\n# Step 6: Craft copper cables and small electric poles\n- Once copper plates are extracted, proceed to craft copper cables.\n- Use the copper cables and wood to craft small electric poles.\n\n# Step 7: Place the small electric pole\n- Position the pole near the assembling machine to provide power.\n\nThis approach ensures that the furnace is correctly set up and resources are managed efficiently. If issues persist, verify the furnace's status and ensure it is not blocked or out of fuel.", "summary_range": "[1-118]"}
