Verify the entity's inventory before attempting extraction.\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Verify that the target tile is unoccupied before placing an entity. Consider adjusting spacing, changing direction, or selecting a different reference position if placement fails due to existing entities or obstacles.\n- When placing entities next to others, ensure there is sufficient space and no collision with existing entities. Adjust spacing or direction as necessary to avoid placement errors."}
