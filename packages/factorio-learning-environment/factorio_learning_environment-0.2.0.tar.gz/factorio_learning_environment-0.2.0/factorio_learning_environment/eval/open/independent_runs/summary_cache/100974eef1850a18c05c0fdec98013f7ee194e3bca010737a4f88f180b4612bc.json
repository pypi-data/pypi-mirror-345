{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Transfer Station at Position (52.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (52.0, -82.0) with a drop position at (52.5, -80.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (53.5, -80.5) receiving coal from the mining drill.\n- Burner Inserter at position (52.5, -79.5) transferring coal from the chest at (53.5, -80.5) to another chest at (52.5, -78.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -78.5) storing coal.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Station at Position (-12.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-12.0, -51.0) with a drop position at (-11.5, -49.5).\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) connected to the mining drill.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-11.5, -49.5) storing iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-11.5, -48.5) waiting for source items from the chest at (-11.5, -49.5).\n- Burner Inserter at position (-8.5, -48.5) waiting for source items.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -46.5) waiting for source items, connected to a wooden chest at (-13.5, -45.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source items are available for the inserters to pick up. Check for blockages or missing items in the supply chain.\n- Verify that the inserters are correctly positioned to pick up items from the designated source.\n\n### Full Chest Warning\n- Regularly monitor and empty chests that are used as drop-off points for mining drills to prevent overflow and halt in production.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `current_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the current inventory of items such as 'wooden-chest', 'wood', 'coal', 'iron-ore', and 'iron-plate'."}
