{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) with sufficient fuel, extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-15.5, -48.5) and (-14.5, -48.5) for storing extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5) transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-14.5, -47.5) assisting in transferring materials.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -46.5) for storing iron plates.\n\n### Additional Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-10.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-10.0, -48.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-8.5, -47.5) transferring iron plates to an output chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-7.5, -47.5) for storing iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source chest or entity has sufficient items for the inserter to transfer. Regularly check and replenish the source inventory.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Space in Destination\n- Make sure that the destination chest or entity has enough space to accommodate the items being transferred by the inserter. Regularly clear out the destination inventory to prevent blockage.\n\n### Source is Empty\n- Monitor resource levels in storage chests and mining drills to ensure continuous supply to furnaces and other processing entities. Refill them as needed to avoid production halts.\n\n### Furnace Belt at Drop Position is Blocked\n- Ensure that the belt or destination at the drop position of the inserter is not obstructed. Clear any blockages to maintain smooth operation."}
