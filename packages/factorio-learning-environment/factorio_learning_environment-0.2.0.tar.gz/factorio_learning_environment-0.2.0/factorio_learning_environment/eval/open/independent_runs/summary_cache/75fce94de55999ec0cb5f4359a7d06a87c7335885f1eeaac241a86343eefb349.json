{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-20.0, -70.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnace** at position (-20.0, -70.0) fueled by coal, currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0) fueled by coal, currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n- **Furnace** at position (5.0, 0.0) fueled by coal, currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Facility at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-14.0, -53.0), out of fuel, connected to chests at positions (-14.5, -54.5) and (-12.5, -54.5).\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -54.5), waiting for source items, connected to chests at positions (-14.5, -54.5) and (-12.5, -54.5).\n\n### Copper Ore Mining Facility at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (53.0, -83.0), fueled by coal, waiting for space in destination, connected to chests at positions (52.5, -84.5) and (54.5, -84.5).\n\n### Iron Ore Storage and Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-16.5, -69.5), waiting for source items, connected to chests at positions (-17.5, -69.5) and (-15.5, -69.5).\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-15.5, -64.5), waiting for source items, connected to chests at positions (-16.5, -64.5) and (-14.5, -64.5).\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-19.5, -61.5), waiting for source items, connected to chests at positions (-20.5, -61.5) and (-18.5, -61.5).\n\n### Copper Ore Storage System\nConsists of multiple chests positioned at various coordinates such as (0.5, -4.5), (5.5, -4.5), (0.5, -3.5), etc., storing copper ore.\n\n### Transport Belt System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **BeltGroup** connecting positions (1.5, 1.5) to (3.5, 1.5) and (2.5, 1.5) to (4.5, 1.5).\n- **BeltGroup** connecting positions (3.5, 2.5) to (5.5, 2.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### NameError due to Undefined Class\n- Ensure that all classes or entities you are referring to are properly imported or defined in the script. For example, the `BurnerInserter` class should be imported or defined before use.\n\n### TypeError when Calling Non-callable Objects\n- Verify that you are not attempting to call objects that are not functions or methods. For instance, ensure that you are not trying to call a `Chest` object as if it were a function.\n\n### Inserter Drop Position Mismatch\n- Double-check the drop positions of inserters to ensure they are correctly aligned with the intended destination. Adjust the inserter's position if necessary to match the drop position with the target entity.\n\n### Handling Full Chests\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are full to prevent mining drills from halting due to lack of space in the destination chest.\n\n### Fuel Management for Mining Drills\n- Ensure that mining drills have a consistent supply of fuel to prevent them from stopping due to being out of fuel. Regularly refuel drills as needed."}
