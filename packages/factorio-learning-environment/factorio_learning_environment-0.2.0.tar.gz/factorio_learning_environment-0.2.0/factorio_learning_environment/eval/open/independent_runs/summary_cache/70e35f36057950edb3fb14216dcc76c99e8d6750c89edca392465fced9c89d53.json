{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Plate Smelting Setup at position (x=52.0, y=-79.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=52.0, y=-79.0)\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=53.5, y=-79.5) (out of fuel)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=54.5, y=-79.5) (contains iron plates)\n\n#### Iron Ore Mining Setup at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) (out of fuel)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) (empty)\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) (waiting for source items)\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-12.5, y=-48.5) (waiting for source items)\n\n#### Storage Area at position (x=0.5, y=0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=0.5, y=0.5) (contains various items)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=1.5, y=0.5) (contains various items)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=2.5, y=0.5) (contains coal)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=3.5, y=0.5) (contains coal)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=4.5, y=0.5) (contains coal and iron ore)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=5.5, y=0.5) (contains iron ore, plates, and gear wheels)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors with Mining Drill not working\n- **Issue**: The mining drill at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) is not working due to lack of fuel and a full chest at the drop position.\n- **Solution**: Ensure the mining drill has fuel and that the chest at the drop position is not full. Empty the chest or add more storage capacity.\n\n#### Errors with Burner Inserters out of fuel\n- **Issue**: Burner inserters at positions (x=53.5, y=-79.5) and (x=55.5, y=-78.5) are out of fuel.\n- **Solution**: Add coal or other fuel to the burner inserters to ensure they can operate.\n\n#### Errors with Furnace having no ingredients\n- **Issue**: The stone furnace at position (x=52.0, y=-79.0) has no ingredients to smelt.\n- **Solution**: Ensure that the furnace is supplied with iron ore and fuel (coal) to start smelting.\n\n#### Errors with Inserter waiting for source items\n- **Issue**: The burner inserter at position (x=42.5, y=-80.5) is waiting for source items.\n- **Solution**: Ensure that the chest at position (x=41.5, y=-80.5) contains items that the inserter can pick up and transfer.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n#### Utility Functions\n- **None defined yet**\n\n#### Important Variables\n- **None assigned yet**"}
