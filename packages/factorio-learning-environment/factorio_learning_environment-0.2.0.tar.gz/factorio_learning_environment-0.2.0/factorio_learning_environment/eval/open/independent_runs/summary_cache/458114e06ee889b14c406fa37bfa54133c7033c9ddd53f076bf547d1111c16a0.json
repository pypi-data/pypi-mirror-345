{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\u2022 No new structures have been successfully assembled on the map. Repeated attempts to craft and place a Lab at (0.5, 2.5) did not yield a valid structure due to inventory shortages and cascading resource\u2010requirements. Although existing furnaces were identified and used for smelting (an iron-smelting furnace at Position(x=5.0, y=5.0) and a copper-smelting furnace at Position(x=-27.0, y=-60.0)), none of these operations resulted in the creation of new, agent\u2010built production structures.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 Incorrect API usage for get_entities:\n\u2003\u2013 When calling get_entities, use only the supported argument format. Avoid adding unsupported keyword arguments (such as \u201cradius\u201d) or extra positional arguments.\n\u2022 Entity placement failures:\n\u2003\u2013 Before attempting to place an entity (for example, a Lab at (0.5, 2.5)), confirm that the required item is available in the inventory.\n\u2022 Handling None values in iteration:\n\u2003\u2013 Validate that functions return a proper iterable (or an empty list) before looping over results to prevent \u2018NoneType\u2019 errors.\n\u2022 Crafting resource shortfalls:\n\u2003\u2013 Ensure that all recipe dependencies and sub-ingredients (for instance, iron-gear-wheels and copper-cables required for crafting a Lab) are sufficiently available. Monitor resource counts after processing (such as smelting) so that crafting operations are only initiated when prerequisites are met."}
