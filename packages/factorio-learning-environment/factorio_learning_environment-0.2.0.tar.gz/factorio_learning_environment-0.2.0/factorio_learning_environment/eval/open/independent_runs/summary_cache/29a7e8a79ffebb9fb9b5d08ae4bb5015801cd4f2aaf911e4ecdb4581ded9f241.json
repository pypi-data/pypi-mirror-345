The inserter at position (41.5, -83.5) is waiting for source items. Verify that the source chest or entity has items to be moved.\n\n#### Errors with Furnace Operation\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Both furnaces at positions (61.0, -54.0) and (64.0, -53.0) have no ingredients to smelt. Make sure to supply the furnaces with the required raw materials.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n- **Functions Defined:**\n  - None recorded in the logs.\n\n- **Variables Assigned:**\n  - `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the current inventory of the agent, including items like stone-brick, wood, coal, stone, iron-ore, and iron-plate.\n\nNo utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided logs."}
