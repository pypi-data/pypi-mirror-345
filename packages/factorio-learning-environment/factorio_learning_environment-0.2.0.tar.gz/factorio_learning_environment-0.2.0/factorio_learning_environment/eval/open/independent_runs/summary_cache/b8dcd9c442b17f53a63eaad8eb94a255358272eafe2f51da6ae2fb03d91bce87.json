{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-44.5, -124.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (-40.5, -113.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-15.0, -76.0) with a Wooden Chest at Position (-15.5, -77.5)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-19.0, -73.0)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0)\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) connected to a Wooden Chest at Position (6.5, -59.5)\n\n### Pipe Network\nConsists of multiple Pipe Groups, including:\n- PipeGroup at Position (-40.5, -123.5)\n- PipeGroup at Position (-47.5, -121.5)\n- PipeGroup at Position (-45.5, -120.5)\n- PipeGroup at Position (-42.5, -120.5)\n- PipeGroup at Position (-47.5, -119.5)\n- PipeGroup at Position (-37.5, -111.5)\n- PipeGroup at Position (-43.5, -109.5)\n- PipeGroup at Position (-1.5, 11.5)\n- PipeGroup at Position (-0.5, 17.5)\n- PipeGroup at Position (-12.5, 23.5)\n- PipeGroup at Position (-4.5, 24.5)\n- PipeGroup at Position (1.5, 24.5)\n- PipeGroup at Position (2.5, 25.5)\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of Electricity Group with poles at various positions, including:\n- Position (9.5, -67.5)\n- Position (8.5, -67.5)\n- Position (12.5, -66.5)\n- Position (-21.5, -73.5)\n- Position (-17.5, -72.5)\n- Position (-16.5, -73.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Using `pickup_entity` Function\n- Ensure that the second argument in `pickup_entity` is a valid Position object. Correct usage: `pickup_entity(Prototype.Pipe, position=Position(x, y))`.\n\n### Errors Due to Obstructing Entities Near Offshore Pump\n- Check for and clear any obstructing entities near the offshore pump to ensure proper connectivity and functionality.\n\n### Errors with Unconnected Entities\n- Ensure all entities such as boilers, steam engines, and inserters are properly connected to their respective networks (e.g., fluid or electricity) to avoid warnings like \"not connected to power network\" or \"no input liquid\"."}
