{"content": "In your recent attempt to craft a Burner Mining Drill, you encountered two main issues:\n\n1. **Craftable Items List**: The output indicated that the only items available to craft were the Iron Gear Wheel, Iron Ore, and Stone. This suggests that the necessary components for other recipes, particularly the Iron Plate, are not available in your inventory.\n\n2. **Crafting Error**: The attempt to craft the Burner Mining Drill failed because it requires Iron Plates, which you currently do not have. The recipe for the Burner Mining Drill includes Iron Plates as an intermediate product, and since you haven't smelted Iron Ore into Iron Plates yet, the crafting process cannot proceed.\n\n### Tips to Avoid These Errors in the Future:\n\n1. **Resource Preparation**: Always ensure that you have the necessary intermediate products before attempting to craft an item. For the Burner Mining Drill, you need to smelt Iron Ore into Iron Plates first. Follow the material processing requirements outlined in the manual.\n\n2. **Check Inventory Before Crafting**: Before crafting any item, inspect your inventory to see if you have all the required components. Use a helper function to check for the availability of all necessary materials for the recipe you want to craft.\n\n3. **Smelting Process**: Remember that ores must be processed into plates before they can be used in crafting. Always include a step for smelting ores into their respective plates before attempting to craft items that require them.\n\n4. **Crafting Order**: When planning your crafting actions, ensure you follow the correct order:\n   - Gather resources (e.g., Iron Ore).\n   - Smelt resources into usable forms (e.g., Iron Plates).\n   - Craft the desired item (e.g., Burner Mining Drill).\n\n5. **Error Handling**: Implement error handling for crafting actions. If a crafting attempt fails, check the inventory and required materials again to identify what is missing.\n\nBy following these guidelines, you can streamline your crafting process and avoid similar errors in the future.", "summary_range": "[1-98]"}
