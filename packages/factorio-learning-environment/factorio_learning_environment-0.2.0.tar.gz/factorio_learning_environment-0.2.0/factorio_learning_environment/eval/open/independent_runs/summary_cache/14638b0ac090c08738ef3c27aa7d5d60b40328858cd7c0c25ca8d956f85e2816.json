{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Transportation System at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) extracting coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (40.5, -83.5) storing coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (41.5, -83.5) transferring coal from the chest to a transport belt.\n- Transport Belt starting at position (42.5, -83.5) moving coal.\n- Additional Burner Inserter at position (41.5, -80.5) transferring coal to another wooden chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -79.5) storing additional coal.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Stone Furnace at position (2.0, 0.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Transport Belt Blockage\n- Ensure that transport belts are clear of obstructions to prevent blockage. Clear the belt at (42.5, -83.5) to continue mining operations.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Operations\n- Ensure that inserters have source items available to avoid waiting states. Check that the source inventory is stocked to keep inserters operational.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Operations\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Supply the required resources to maintain continuous production."}
