{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0), which is currently working and has a warning indicating that the output is blocked by an item on the ground. The drill is fueled with coal and is extracting iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0), which is not operational due to the absence of ingredients to smelt. The furnace is fueled with coal and has a warning indicating no ingredients to smelt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied or invalid locations\n- Ensure that the desired location for placing entities such as Wooden Chests, Burner Inserters, and Transport Belts is not already occupied by another entity. Verify the tile is clear before attempting to place an entity.\n\n### Errors when moving entities to invalid locations\n- Confirm that the target location for moving entities like Stone Furnaces is valid and unoccupied. Check the destination tile's availability before moving an entity.\n\n### Errors when attempting to access non-existent entities\n- Double-check the existence and position of entities before attempting to access them using functions like `get_entity`. Ensure the entity type and position are accurate to avoid exceptions.\n\n### Errors due to blocked outputs\n- Address warnings related to blocked outputs by ensuring there is a sink entity in place to accept the output from drills or other production entities. This will prevent production halts due to output blockage.\n\n### Errors due to lack of ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces and other processing entities have the necessary ingredients to operate. Regularly check and supply the required resources to maintain continuous production."}
