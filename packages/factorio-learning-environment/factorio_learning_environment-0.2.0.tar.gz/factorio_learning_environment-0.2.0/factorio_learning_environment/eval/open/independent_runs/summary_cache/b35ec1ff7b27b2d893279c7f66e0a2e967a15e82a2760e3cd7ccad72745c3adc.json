{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (40.0, y=-84.0) extracting resources with a warning of output being blocked by items on the ground. It is connected to a **Wooden Chest** at position (41.5, y=-83.5).\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-15.0, y=-49.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (54.5, y=-83.5) transferring items from a **Wooden Chest** at position (56.5, y=-83.5).\n- **BeltGroup** connecting various entities, including belts at positions (50.5, y=-86.5) to (48.5, y=-86.5) and (49.5, y=-86.5) to (47.5, y=-86.5), facilitating the movement of coal and other materials.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Mining Drill Output Blockage\n- Ensure that the area around the mining drill output is clear of items on the ground to prevent blockage. Regularly check and clear any obstructions to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Errors When Inserters Are Not Operating\n- Verify that inserters have a clear path to transfer items between entities and that they are properly fueled and positioned to pick up and drop items efficiently."}
