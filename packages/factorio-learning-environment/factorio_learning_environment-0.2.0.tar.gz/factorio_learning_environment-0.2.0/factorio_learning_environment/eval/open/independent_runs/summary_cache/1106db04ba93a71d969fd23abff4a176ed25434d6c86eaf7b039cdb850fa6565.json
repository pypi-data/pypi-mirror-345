{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Transfer System at Position (52.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (52.0, -82.0) with a wooden chest at position (53.5, -80.5) for coal storage.\n- Burner Inserter at position (52.5, -79.5) transferring coal from the chest at position (53.5, -80.5) to another chest at position (52.5, -78.5).\n- Another Burner Inserter at position (52.5, -76.5) waiting for source items to transfer from the chest at position (52.5, -77.5).\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing System at Position (-12.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-12.0, -51.0) with a drop position at the wooden chest at position (-11.5, -49.5).\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) for smelting iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-11.5, -48.5) waiting for source items from the chest at position (-11.5, -49.5).\n- Additional Burner Inserters at positions (-8.5, -48.5) and (-13.5, -46.5) also waiting for source items.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entities (such as chests or furnaces) have the necessary items available for the inserters to transfer. Check for blockages or missing items in the supply chain to prevent inserters from idling.\n\n### Chest Overcapacity\n- Avoid overfilling chests to prevent mining drills from halting due to full inventory. Regularly check and empty chests to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Furnace Lacking Ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces have the required ingredients for smelting. Regularly supply raw materials to avoid production stoppages.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\nNo utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `current_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the current inventory of items such as 'wooden-chest', 'wood', 'coal', 'iron-ore', and 'iron-plate'."}
