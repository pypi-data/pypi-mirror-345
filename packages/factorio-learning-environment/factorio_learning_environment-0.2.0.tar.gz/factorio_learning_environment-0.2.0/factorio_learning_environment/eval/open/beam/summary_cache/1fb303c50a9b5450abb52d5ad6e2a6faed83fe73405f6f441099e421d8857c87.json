{"content": "It seems that the **Burner Inserter** is not being detected on the map, which indicates that there may be an issue with how I am querying for the entity or that it has been removed or is not present in the current game state.\n\n### Analysis of the Situation\n\n1. **No Burner Inserters Found**: The repeated message indicating that the **Burner Inserter** is not found suggests that the entity might not exist in the current game state or that the query to retrieve it is not functioning as expected.\n\n2. **Status Check**: The status of the **Burner Inserter** was previously reported as **WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS**, which means it was present but not operational due to a lack of items to process.\n\n### Steps to Resolve the Issue\n\n1. **Reconfirm the Presence of Burner Inserters**: I will attempt to list all entities again without filtering by status to ensure that I can see all **Burner Inserters** on the map.\n\n2. **Inspect the Game State**: If no **Burner Inserters** are found, I will need to check the overall game state to understand why they are not present.\n\n### Implementation\n\nLet's implement these steps:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Retrieve all entities of type Burner Inserter without filtering by status\nburner_inserters = get_entities({Prototype.BurnerInserter})\n\n# Step 2: Check if any Burner Inserters are found\nif burner_inserters:\n    print(\"Found Burner Inserters:\")\n    for inserter in burner_inserters:\n        print(f\" - {inserter.name} at {inserter.position} with status {inserter.status}\")\n\n    # Step 3: Attempt to insert coal into the first found Burner Inserter\n    first_burner_inserter = burner_inserters[0]  # Take the first one found\n    if current_inventory.get(Prototype.Coal, 0) >= 5:\n        insert_item(Prototype.Coal, first_burner_inserter, 5)  # Insert coal into the first Burner Inserter\n        print(\"Inserted 5 coal into the Burner Inserter.\")\n        \n        # Step 4: Check the status of the Burner Inserter after the insertion\n        burner_inserter_status = first_burner_inserter.status\n        print(\"Status of the Burner Inserter after refueling:\", burner_inserter_status)\n    else:\n        print(\"Not enough coal in inventory to insert into the Burner Inserter.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No Burner Inserters found on the map.\")\n```\n\n### Expected Outcome\nThis approach should help clarify whether any **Burner Inserters** are present on the map and allow for further actions based on their status. If none are found, it may indicate a need to investigate the game state or the conditions under which the **Burner Inserters** were expected to be present.", "summary_range": "[1-2026]"}
