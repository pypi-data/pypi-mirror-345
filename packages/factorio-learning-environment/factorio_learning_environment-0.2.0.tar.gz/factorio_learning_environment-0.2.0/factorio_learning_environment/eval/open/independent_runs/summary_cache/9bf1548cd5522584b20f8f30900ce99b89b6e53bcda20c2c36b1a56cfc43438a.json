{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (20.5, -4.0)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (4.5, -10.5) and another at Position (19.5, -1.5)\n- Boiler at Position (20.5, -4.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (22.5, -7.5)\n- Pipe network connecting these entities, including positions (20.5, -10.5), (21.5, -10.5), (22.5, -10.5), (20.5, -6.5), (20.5, -7.5), (20.5, -5.5), and (19.5, -2.5), (18.5, -2.5), (18.5, -3.5)\n- Small Electric Poles at various positions including (24.5, -6.5), (24.5, -7.5), (22.5, -4.5), (10.5, -1.5), (11.5, -1.5), (12.5, 0.5), (12.5, 1.5), (10.5, 2.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Production at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-11.0, 20.0)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (-11.5, 18.5) storing iron ore\n\n### Copper Plate Production at Position (2.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (20.0, 20.0)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (2.0, 0.0)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (19.5, 18.5) storing copper ore\n\n### Copper Cable Factory at Position (10.5, 0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling Machine at Position (10.5, 0.5)\n- Inserters at Positions (-3.5, 1.5), (7.5, 5.5), and (9.5, 5.5)\n- Belt Group connecting the furnace at Position (2.0, 0.0) to the Assembling Machine at Position (10.5, 0.5)\n- Wooden Chests at Positions (-3.5, 0.5), (8.5, 0.5), (8.5, 5.5), and (-3.5, 2.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors When Inserting Items Without Inventory\n- Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. For example, the error \"Could not insert: 'No coal to insert from your inventory'\" suggests that there was an attempt to insert coal without having it in the inventory.\n\n### Errors Due to Missing Ingredients in Assembling Machines\n- Check that all required ingredients are available before starting a production process in an assembling machine. The warning \"cannot create copper-cable due to missing resources: copper-plate (1)\" indicates a shortage of copper plates needed for production."}
