{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=61.0, y=-54.0) with 25 iron plates.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=64.0, y=-53.0) with 97 iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=62.5, y=-53.5) connected to the furnace at (x=61.0, y=-54.0) and a chest at (x=61.5, y=-52.5).\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=65.5, y=-52.5) connected to the furnace at (x=64.0, y=-53.0).\n\n### Coal Mining Operation\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0) with coal as fuel and connected to multiple chests.\n\n### Storage Area\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Multiple Wooden Chests at positions (x=41.5, y=-84.5), (x=40.5, y=-84.5), (x=40.5, y=-83.5), (x=43.5, y=-83.5), (x=42.5, y=-83.5), and (x=44.5, y=-83.5) containing various resources like coal and iron gear wheels.\n\n### Belt Network\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Multiple BeltGroups connecting various positions, facilitating the movement of items across the map.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Belt Connection\n- Ensure that the path for the underground belts is clear and valid before attempting to connect segments. The failure to connect segments from positions (x=43.5, y=-81.5) to (x=49.5, y=-79.5) and further indicates a blockage or invalid path.\n- Verify that the destination for the belts is reachable and that there are no obstacles preventing the connection.\n\n### Errors when Placing Belts\n- Before placing a belt, ensure that the tile is not occupied by another entity to avoid placement failures.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Defined Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined by the agent in the provided logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `transport_belt`: int = 162\n- `burner_inserter`: int = 80\n- `coal`: int = 2880\n- `iron_plate`: int = 630\n- `iron_gear_wheel`: int = 1008\n\nThese variables represent the current inventory of the agent and are crucial for planning further construction and crafting activities."}
