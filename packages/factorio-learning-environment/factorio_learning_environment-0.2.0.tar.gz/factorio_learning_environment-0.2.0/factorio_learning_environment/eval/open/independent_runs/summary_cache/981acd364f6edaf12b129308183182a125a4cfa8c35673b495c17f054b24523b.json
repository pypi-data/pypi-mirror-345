{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Setup at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) extracting iron ore and dropping it into a chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5) storing iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5) intended to transfer iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities Too Far\n- Ensure you are within the maximum placement distance (10 units) from the target position when placing entities. Move closer to the target position before attempting to place the entity.\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities with Collisions\n- Before placing an entity, verify that the target position is free from other entities or obstacles. Consider adjusting the spacing, changing the direction, or selecting a different reference position to avoid collisions.\n\n### Errors Due to Inserter Misalignment\n- Ensure that inserters are correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items between entities. Reposition and align inserters if they are not effectively transferring items.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Fuel\n- Regularly check and refuel entities such as inserters and furnaces to ensure continuous operation. Maintain an adequate supply of fuel in your inventory to avoid interruptions.\n\n### Errors Due to Full Inventory or Chest\n- Monitor the inventory levels of chests and ensure they have sufficient space to store incoming items. Extract items from the chest if it becomes full to continue operations.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Ingredients in Furnace\n- Ensure that the furnace receives the necessary ingredients for smelting. Check the inserter setup and reposition if the furnace is not receiving iron ore."}
