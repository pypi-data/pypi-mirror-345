{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-9.5, 24.5)\nConsists of offshore pump (position -9.5, 24.5), boiler (position not specified), and steam engine (position not specified). The offshore pump is responsible for supplying water to the boiler, which in turn generates steam for the steam engine.\n\n### Copper plate factory at position(1.0, 1.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace (position 1.0, 1.0) that processes iron ore into iron plates.\n- Chest (position 3.5, 1.5) that stores iron plates.\n- Burner inserter (position 8.5, 1.5) that transfers items from the chest to the lab.\n- Lab (position 6.5, 1.5) that conducts research.\n\n### Additional structures\n- Multiple wooden chests located at positions (3.5, 3.5) and (3.5, 5.5) that store various resources.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing electric poles\n- Electric poles failed to be placed at (52.5, 49.0) and (52.5, 54.0) due to being blocked by entities or unplaceable terrain (water). Ensure the target location is clear of obstructions before attempting to place electric poles.\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities\n- The agent encountered an error when trying to retrieve a steam engine at position (10.0, 0.0), indicating that no entity of that type was found. Verify the position and ensure the entity exists before attempting to access it.\n\n### General placement errors\n- Ensure that the area where you want to place any entity is free from other entities and suitable for placement. If the terrain is unplaceable, consider moving to a different location."}
