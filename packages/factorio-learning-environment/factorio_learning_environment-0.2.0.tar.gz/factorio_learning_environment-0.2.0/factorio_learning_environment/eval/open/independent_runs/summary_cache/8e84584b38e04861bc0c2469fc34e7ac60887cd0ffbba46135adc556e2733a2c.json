(Step 184 produced an additional 4 iron plates from this furnace.)\n- Stone Furnace (copper smelting) at position (x=-4.0, y=21.0) employed for copper plate production.\n- Burner Inserter for copper extraction at position (x=0.5, y=21.5) that extracts copper plates from the copper furnace. Its computed drop position is (x=1.5, y=21.5). (After initial placement failures at spacing 0 and 1, this inserter was successfully placed in Step 191.)\n\n### Automation Lab & Steam Power System (Integrated System)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab at position (x=-7.5, y=18.5) configured for automation research.\n- Boiler at position (x=-5.5, y=24.0) flagged with fuel issues.\n- Generator (Steam Engine) at position (x=-0.5, y=24.5) with an energy level of 0.0 and warnings indicating no power network connection, no input liquid, and no fluid present.\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-7.5, y=25.5) operating normally.\n- Electricity Group comprising small electric poles at positions (x=-0.5, y=11.5), (x=-7.5, y=15.5), (x=-4.5, y=15.5), (x=3.5, y=19.5) and (x=1.5, y=22.5).\n- Pipe Groups forming the fluid network:\n   \u2022 PipeGroup (fluid_system=4664) at position (x=-10.5, y=16.5) \u2013 EMPTY.\n   \u2022 PipeGroup (fluid_system=4665) at position (x=-12.5, y=18.5) \u2013 EMPTY.\n   \u2022 PipeGroup (fluid_system=4667) at position (x=-8.5, y=20.5) \u2013 FULL_OUTPUT (fluid: water).\n   \u2022 PipeGroup (fluid_system=4669) at position (x=-2.5, y=21.5) \u2013 EMPTY.\n\n### Copper Cable Factory at position (x=1.5, y=19.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- AssemblingMachine1 at position (x=1.5, y=19.5) running the copper-cable recipe. (Current warnings include lack of electricity and missing copper-plate resource.)\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=1.5, y=17.5) with a pickup coordinate at (x=1.5, y=16.5) and a drop coordinate at (x=1.5, y=18.5).\n- Input Chest re-located to position (x=2.5, y=17.5) designated for receiving copper plates.\n- Output Chest at position (x=1.5, y=21.5) for dispatching copper-cable.\n- Dedicated Copper Buffer Chest at position (x=-5.5, y=21.5) holding copper plates.\n- Dedicated Transport Belt Segment at position (x=0.5, y=17.5) intended for copper plate transfer. (Multiple attempts from Steps 185\u2013188 to connect a belt\u2014from computed furnace drop positions and intermediate waypoints\u2014to the production network have encountered connection errors. In Step 191, an attempt to link the belt from the newly computed burner inserter drop (intended at (x=1.5, y=21.5)) failed due to a source type conflict.)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 Belt Connection and Target Compatibility:\n  - Do not connect transport belts directly to entities such as AssemblingMachine, StoneFurnace, or WoodenChest. Use an intermediary inserter to establish proper transfer links.\n  - When connecting belts from a source, verify that the target entity accepts belt inputs; errors occur when, for example, attempting to use a wooden chest as the direct source.\n\n\u2022 Buildable Area Retrieval and Variable References:\n  - Ensure that functions retrieving buildable areas are invoked with proper position objects. Undefined or misused variables (e.g., target_place_pos, new_computed_drop) trigger TypeErrors and NameErrors.\n  \n\u2022 Transport Belt Path Validity:\n  - Precompute and validate intermediate waypoints to guarantee that transport belt paths can be normalised successfully. Adjust paths to avoid \u201cNot a valid path to normalise\u201d errors.\n  \n\u2022 Inserter Placement and Spacing:\n  - Verify that placement positions for inserters are free of blocking entities (such as pipes) by adjusting the spacing or changing placement direction. (Initial attempts with spacing 0 and 1 led to placement failures near the copper furnace.)\n  \n\u2022 API Usage and Variable Management:\n  - Double-check that all necessary variables (for example, those representing inserter drop positions) are correctly defined and referenced before use to prevent NameErrors.\n  \n\u2022 System Coordination:\n  - Synchronize transfer operations between smelting outputs, extraction inserters, and factory inputs to ensure that all connection targets are appropriately aligned and do not conflict with occupied positions."}
