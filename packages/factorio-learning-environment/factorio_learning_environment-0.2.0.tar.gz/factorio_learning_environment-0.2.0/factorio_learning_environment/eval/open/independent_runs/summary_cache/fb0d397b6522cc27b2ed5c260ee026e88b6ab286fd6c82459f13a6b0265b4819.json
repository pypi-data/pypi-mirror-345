{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nCurrently, there are no successfully constructed structures on the map. The agent has attempted to place various entities such as offshore pumps and boilers but has not succeeded due to unsuitable positions and validation errors.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Finding Suitable Positions for Offshore Pumps\n- Ensure that the offshore pump is placed adjacent to a water source. The agent repeatedly failed to find a suitable position for the offshore pump despite identifying water sources. Verify that the pump is being placed on a valid water tile.\n\n### Errors in Placing Boilers\n- Make sure that the boiler is placed on a flat, unobstructed land tile. The agent encountered multiple errors indicating unsuitable positions for boiler placement.\n\n### Validation Errors for BuildingBox\n- When placing entities like offshore pumps and boilers, ensure that the dimensions (height and width) are specified correctly as valid integers. The agent faced validation errors related to incorrect data types for these dimensions.\n\n### Type Errors in Entity Placement\n- Avoid using non-numeric types for numeric parameters. The agent encountered errors due to passing 'ModelPrivateAttr' instead of a valid numeric type for entity dimensions. Ensure all numeric inputs are valid integers or floats as required by the API."}
