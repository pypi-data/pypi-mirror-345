{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Setup at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and deposits it into the chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities too far from the player\n- Ensure you are within the maximum placement distance (10 units) from the target position when placing entities. Move closer to the intended position before attempting to place.\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied tiles\n- Verify that the target tile is unoccupied before placing an entity. Consider adjusting the spacing, direction, or reference position to avoid collisions with existing entities.\n\n### Inserter setup errors\n- Regularly check and ensure that inserters are correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items between entities. Misalignment can prevent the transfer of materials, causing production halts.\n\n### Fuel management for entities\n- Keep track of fuel levels in entities like mining drills, inserters, and furnaces. Regularly refuel them to maintain continuous operation and avoid production stoppages.\n\n### Inventory management\n- Monitor the chest inventory to prevent it from becoming full, which can halt mining operations. Ensure there is sufficient space for new resources to be deposited."}
