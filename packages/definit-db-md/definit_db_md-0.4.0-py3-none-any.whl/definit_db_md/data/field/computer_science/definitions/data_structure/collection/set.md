# set

A set is an [abstract data type](/data_md/computer_science/definitions/data_structure/abstract_data_type.md) that can store unique values, without any particular order. It is a computer implementation of the mathematical concept of a [finite set](/data_md/mathematics/definitions/foundamental/finite_set.md). Unlike most other [collection](/data_md/computer_science/definitions/data_structure/collection.md) types, rather than retrieving a specific element from a set, one typically tests a value for membership in a set.
