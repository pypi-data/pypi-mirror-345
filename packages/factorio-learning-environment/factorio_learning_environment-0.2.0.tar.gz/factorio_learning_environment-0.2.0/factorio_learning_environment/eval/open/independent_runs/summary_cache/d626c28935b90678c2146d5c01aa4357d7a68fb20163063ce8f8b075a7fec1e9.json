{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-47.5, -123.5)\n- Boiler at position (-46.5, -119.0)\n- Steam Engine at position (-40.5, -113.5)\n- Pipe connections linking the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -76.0) with a Wooden Chest at position (-15.5, -77.5) for iron ore collection\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -73.0) processing iron ore\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (9.0, -64.0) and another at position (6.0, -62.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (7.5, -61.5) storing iron plates\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) transferring items between entities\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -73.0) processing copper ore\n\n### Electrical Network\nConsists of:\n- Multiple Small Electric Poles connecting various entities, ensuring power distribution\n\n### Pipe Networks\nMultiple pipe groups exist, connecting various fluid systems across the map. Notable positions include:\n- PipeGroup at position (-47.5, -122.5) with water\n- PipeGroup at position (-44.5, -122.5) and others extending to various positions\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors When Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure that the path between entities is clear of obstructions before attempting to connect pipes. Remove any existing entities that may block the connection.\n\n### Errors When Placing Entities on Occupied Tiles\n- Verify that the target position is free of other entities before placing a new entity. If an entity already exists at the target position, remove it before proceeding with placement."}
