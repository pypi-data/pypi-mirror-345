{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entity:\n- Stone Furnace used for smelting iron ore by inserting coal and ore. Initially at (-15.0, -50.0), it received additional iron ore (harvested from near (-15.5, -50.5)) and advanced its production to yield 12 iron plates. It currently operates with a coal fuel reserve of 8 units.\n\nERROR TIPS\n### Insufficient Fuel during Insertion\n- Check inventory for the required fuel (e.g., coal) before attempting insertion into a furnace to ensure uninterrupted smelting cycles.\n- Verify resource availability to avoid errors due to missing items.\n\n### Insufficient Production and Process Delays in Smelting\n- When the furnace produces fewer iron plates than expected, ensure that both fuel and ore are supplied adequately. Boost smelting by adding extra fuel (e.g., coal) when production is lagging.\n- Adjust production intervals to allow the furnace to complete its smelting cycle and monitor status warnings to prevent process timeouts."}
