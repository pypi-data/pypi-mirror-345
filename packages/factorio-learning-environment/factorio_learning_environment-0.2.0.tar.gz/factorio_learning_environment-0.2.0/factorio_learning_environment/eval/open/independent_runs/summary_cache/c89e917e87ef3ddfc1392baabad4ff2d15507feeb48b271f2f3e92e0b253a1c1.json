{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nNo structures have been successfully created on the map as of the latest execution steps. The logs indicate attempts to place various entities, but none have resulted in a completed structure.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied or invalid tiles\n- Ensure that the target tile is unoccupied and suitable for the entity you are trying to place. This includes checking for existing entities or terrain features that may block placement. For example:\n  - Cannot place a Transport Belt at x=65.0 y=-105.0.\n  - Cannot place a Stone Furnace at x=5.0 y=5.0.\n  - Cannot place a Burner Inserter at x=-50.0 y=50.0.\n  - Cannot place a Wooden Chest at x=0.0 y=10.0.\n  - Cannot place a Wooden Chest at x=10.0 y=0.0.\n  - Cannot place a Burner Inserter at x=-100.0 y=100.0.\n  - Cannot place a Wooden Chest at x=0.0 y=0.0.\n\n### General Tips\n- Before placing an entity, verify the coordinates and ensure that the placement area is clear and appropriate for the type of entity being placed.\n- Regularly check the map for any updates or changes that might affect the placement of entities.\n- Consider using the in-game tools to visualize the placement grid and potential obstructions."}
