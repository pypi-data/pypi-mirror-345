{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Fuel: Coal (4 units)\n  - Connected to a wooden chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Contains: Iron ore (7 units)\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Fuel: Out of fuel\n  - Transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the stone furnace\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0)\n  - Status: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Fuel: Coal (6 units)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Misalignment and Fuel Issues\n- Ensure that inserters are correctly aligned to transfer items between entities. Regularly check and adjust their positions if necessary.\n- Keep inserters fueled to maintain continuous operation. Monitor fuel levels and refuel before they run out.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Iron Ore\n- Verify that the inserter is properly aligned and operational to deliver iron ore to the furnace.\n- Ensure that the chest contains enough iron ore for the inserter to transfer.\n\n### Chest Overflow\n- Regularly check and empty the chest to prevent overflow, which can halt mining operations. Consider expanding storage capacity if necessary.\n\n### Insufficient Inventory Management\n- Maintain a sufficient supply of coal in the inventory to refuel entities as needed. Plan resource collection to avoid shortages."}
