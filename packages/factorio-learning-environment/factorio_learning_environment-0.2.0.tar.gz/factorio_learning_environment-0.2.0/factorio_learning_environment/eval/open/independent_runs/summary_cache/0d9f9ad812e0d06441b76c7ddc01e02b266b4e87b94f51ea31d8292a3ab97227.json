{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (9.0, -64.0) with a status of \"NO_INGREDIENTS\" and containing 23 iron plates.\n- Stone Furnace at position (6.0, -62.0) with a status of \"NO_INGREDIENTS\".\n\n### Storage and Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (7.5, -61.5) for storage.\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) with a status of \"NO_POWER\", connected to a small electric pole at position (5.5, -60.5) and (7.5, -60.5), and a wooden chest at position (7.5, -61.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (6.5, -59.5) containing 227 iron plates and 4 copper plates.\n\n### Research Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab with input of 12 automation science packs and a status of \"NO_RESEARCH_IN_PROGRESS\".\n\n### Electricity Generator at position (-5.5, 24.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Boiler at position (-5.5, 24.0) with a status of \"NOT_CONNECTED\".\n- Steam Engine at position (-1.5, 24.5) with a status of \"NOT_CONNECTED\".\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5) with a status of \"WORKING\".\n- PipeGroup at position (-9.5, 23.5) with status \"FULL_OUTPUT\".\n- PipeGroup at position (-4.5, 22.5) with status \"EMPTY\".\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of the following entities:\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at various positions, including (31.5, 1.5), (1.5, -52.5), (5.5, -53.5), and others, with a voltage of 0.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Pipe Connection\n- Ensure that pipes are correctly aligned and connected to form a continuous network. Check the positions and orientations of pipes to avoid disconnections.\n\n### Boiler Not Connected to Fluid Network\n- Verify that the boiler is properly connected to the fluid network. Ensure that all necessary pipes and connections are in place and correctly aligned.\n\n### Inserter Not Receiving Power\n- Check the power network to ensure that inserters are connected to a functioning power source. Verify the connections between electric poles and the inserter.\n\n### No Ingredients in Furnaces\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to operate. Check the input inventories and supply the required materials for smelting.\n\n### Lab Not Conducting Research\n- Confirm that the lab has the necessary science packs and that research is queued to begin. Ensure that the lab is connected to the power network if required."}
