{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-11.5, 18.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position -11.5, 18.5), offshore pump (position -9.5, 24.5), and several pipes connecting these entities. The steam engine is currently not connected to any fluid input, and the offshore pump is operational, providing water.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 0.0, 0.0) and a furnace (position 0.0, 0.0)\n- Burner mining drill (position 5.0, 5.0) and a furnace (position 5.0, 5.0)\n\n### Lab at position(0, 0)\nConsists of a lab (position 0.0, 0.0) that is currently missing science packs for research.\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine (position z1) and inserter that puts into the assembling machine\n- Beltgroup that connects the furnace at position y1 to the assembling machine at position z1\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing. Specifically, check for existing entities at the target location.\n\n### AttributeError when accessing object properties\n- Verify that the properties you are trying to access on an object exist and are correctly referenced. In this case, ensure that 'BoundingBox' has the correct attributes.\n\n### Errors related to placing entities\n- Check the target location for obstructions before attempting to place an entity. If something is in the way, you will need to clear the area or choose a different location."}
