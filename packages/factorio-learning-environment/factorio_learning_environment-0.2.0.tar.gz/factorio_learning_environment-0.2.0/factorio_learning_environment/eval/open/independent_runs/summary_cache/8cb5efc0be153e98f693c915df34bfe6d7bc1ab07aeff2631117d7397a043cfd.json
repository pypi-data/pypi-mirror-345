{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Steam Engine** at position (x=17.5, y=20.5) with warnings of 'no input liquid' and 'no fluid present in connections'.\n- **Boiler** at position (x=1.5, y=23.0) with a warning of 'out of fuel'. It is connected to multiple pipes and has a steam output point at position (x=1.5, y=21.5).\n- **Offshore Pump** at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5), which is working and connected to pipes at positions (x=-9.5, y=23.5) and (x=-8.5, y=23.5).\n- **PipeGroup** for fluid system 94364, starting at position (x=3.5, y=17.5), currently empty.\n- **PipeGroup** for fluid system 94375, starting at position (x=-9.5, y=23.5), currently full with water.\n- **ElectricityGroup** with poles at various positions, having a voltage of 0.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Steam Engine Connections\n- Ensure that all steam engines are properly connected to a source of steam. Check the connections and ensure that the pipes are correctly aligned and connected to a boiler with steam output.\n\n### Errors with Boiler Fueling\n- Ensure that boilers are constantly supplied with fuel. Regularly check fuel levels and automate the refueling process if possible to prevent outages.\n\n### Errors with Fluid Systems\n- Verify that all fluid systems are properly connected and that there are no breaks in the pipe network. Ensure that pumps are correctly positioned and operational to maintain fluid flow.\n\n### Errors with Electricity Network\n- Ensure that the electricity network is fully connected and that all poles are correctly placed to maintain a continuous power supply. Check for any disconnected poles or insufficient power generation."}
