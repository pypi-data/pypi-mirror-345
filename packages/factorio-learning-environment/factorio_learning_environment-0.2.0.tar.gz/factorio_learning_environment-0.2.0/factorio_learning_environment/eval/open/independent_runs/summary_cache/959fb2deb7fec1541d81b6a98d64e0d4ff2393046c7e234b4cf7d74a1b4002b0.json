{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (14.5, 22.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam engine at position (14.5, 22.5)\n- Offshore pump at position (-7.5, 25.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pump to the steam engine with various pipe segments at positions such as (-8.5, 23.5), (-7.5, 23.5), (-2.5, 23.5), (-1.5, 23.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Multiple stone furnaces at positions (0.0, 0.0), (10.0, 0.0), (13.0, 0.0), and (16.0, 0.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates\n- Wooden chests at positions (8.5, -0.5), (17.5, -0.5), (19.5, -0.5), and (20.5, -0.5) for storage\n- Burner inserters at positions (8.5, 0.5), (17.5, 0.5), (19.5, 0.5), and (20.5, 0.5) for transferring items between chests and furnaces\n\n### Lab at Position (Unspecified)\n- Lab with input for automation science packs, currently not conducting research\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- Multiple pipe groups at various positions, such as (x=-0.5, y=11.5) and (x=5.5, y=18.5), for fluid transport\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities\n- Ensure that the target location is free of other entities or terrain obstacles before placing a new entity. This includes checking for water or other unplaceable terrain.\n\n### Errors when Reconnecting Pipes\n- Verify that there is no existing entity at the target pipe placement position. If there is, remove it before attempting to place the pipe.\n- Move closer to the target position when placing pipes or entities, as the maximum allowable distance is 10 units.\n\n### Errors in Entity Retrieval\n- Confirm that the entity exists at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it. Double-check the position coordinates and ensure the entity type matches.\n\n### Type Errors in Code\n- Correct any type mismatches in code, such as using incompatible types in operations. Ensure that all operands in arithmetic operations are of compatible types.\n\n### Steam Engine Connection Issues\n- Investigate and resolve any issues preventing the steam engine from functioning, such as ensuring it is properly connected to the power network and has the necessary fluid inputs."}
