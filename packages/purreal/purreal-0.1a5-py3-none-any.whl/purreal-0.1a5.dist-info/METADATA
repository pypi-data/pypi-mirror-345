## Overview

Purreal is a custom connection pooler designed to enhance the performance and reliability of SurrealDB interactions within Python applications. It provides robust connection pooling with built-in SSL/TLS support, ensuring secure and efficient communication with your SurrealDB database. This library addresses the need for persistent and secure connections, reducing latency and improving overall application responsiveness.

## Key Features

*   **Connection Pooling:**  Maintains a pool of active connections to SurrealDB, minimizing the overhead of establishing new connections for each database interaction.
*   **SSL/TLS Encryption:**  Secures communication between your application and SurrealDB using SSL/TLS encryption, protecting sensitive data in transit.
*   **Customizable Pool Size:**  Allows you to configure the maximum and minimum number of connections in the pool, optimizing resource utilization based on your application's needs.
*   **Connection Health Checks:**  Periodically validates connections in the pool to ensure they are active and healthy, automatically replacing any broken connections.
*   **Asynchronous Support:** Designed to work seamlessly with asynchronous Python code.
*   **Easy Integration:** Simple and straightforward API for integrating Purreal into your existing SurrealDB projects.

## Installation

pip install purreal


## Usage

### Basic Example

```python
from purreal import SurrealDBPoolManager

# Initialize the pool manager
pool_manager = SurrealDBPoolManager()

def main():
    # Create a connection pool
    pool = await pool_manager.create_pool(
        name="my_pool",
        uri=SURREAL_URI,
        credentials={"username": SURREAL_USER, "password": SURREAL_PASS},
        namespace=NAMESPACE,
        database=DATABASE,
        min_connections=2,
        max_connections=10,
        max_idle_time=300,
        connection_timeout=5.0,
        acquisition_timeout=10.0,
        health_check_interval=30,
        max_usage_count=1000,
        connection_retry_attempts=3,
        connection_retry_delay=1.0,
        schema_file=SCHEMA_FILE,
        reset_on_return=True,
        log_queries=True,
    )

    async with pool.connection() as conn:
        # Perform SurrealDB operations using the connection
        result = await conn.query("SELECT * FROM your_table;")
        print(result)

    await pool.close() # Close all connections in the pool when done

if name == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```


### Explanation

1.  **Import `SurrealDBPoolManager`:** Imports the necessary class from the `purreal` library.
2.  **Create a `SurrealDBPoolManager` Instance:**  Creates a `SurrealDBPoolManager` object, configuring it with your SurrealDB connection details, including:
    *   `uri`: The connection URI for SurrealDB.
    *   `credentials`: The username and password for authentication.
    *   `namespace`: The namespace to use.
    *   `database`: The database to connect to.
    *   `min_size`: The minimum number of connections that the pool should maintain.
    *   `max_size`: The maximum number of connections allowed in the pool.
3.  **Acquire a Connection:** Uses an `async with` statement to acquire a connection from the pool. This ensures that the connection is automatically returned to the pool when the block exits, even if errors occur.
4.  **Perform Database Operations:**  Executes SurrealDB queries or other operations using the acquired connection (e.g., `await conn.query(...)`).
5.  **Connection Returned to Pool:** The `async with` statement automatically returns the connection to the pool, making it available for reuse.
6.  **Close the Pool (Important):**  Calls `await pool.close()` to gracefully close all connections in the pool when your application is finished using them.  This is crucial to avoid resource leaks.

### Advanced Configuration

*   **SSL Context:**  You can provide a custom `ssl.SSLContext` object for more fine-grained control over SSL/TLS settings.
*   **Connection Timeout:** Configure the timeout for establishing new connections.
*   **Health Check Interval:**  Adjust the frequency of connection health checks.



## API Reference

### `SurrealDBPoolManager`

*   `__init__(uri, credentials, namespace, database, min_size=2, max_size=10, connection_timeout=None, health_check_interval=None)`:  Initializes a new connection pool.
    *   `uri` (str): The SurrealDB connection URI.
    *   `credentials` (dict): The username and password for authentication.
    *   `namespace` (str): The namespace to use.
    *   `database` (str): The database to use.
    *   `min_size` (int, optional): The minimum number of connections in the pool. Defaults to `2`.
    *   `max_size` (int, optional): The maximum number of connections in the pool. Defaults to `10`.
    *   `connection_timeout` (int, optional): Timeout in seconds for establishing a connection. Defaults to None.
    *   `health_check_interval` (int, optional): Interval in seconds between connection health checks. Defaults to None.
*   `connection()`:  Asynchronously acquires a connection from the pool.  Returns an asynchronous context manager.
*   `close()`:  Asynchronously closes all connections in the pool.
