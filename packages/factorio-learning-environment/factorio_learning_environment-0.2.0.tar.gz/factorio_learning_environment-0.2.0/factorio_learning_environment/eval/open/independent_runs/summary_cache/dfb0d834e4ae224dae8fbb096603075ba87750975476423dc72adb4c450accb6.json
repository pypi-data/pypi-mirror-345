{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Fuel: Coal\n  - Resources: Iron ore\n  - Neighbours: Wooden chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Warning: Chest at drop position is full. Empty the chest at (-14.5, -48.5) to continue mining.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Inventory: Iron ore and iron plates\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Function: Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace\n  - Fuel: Coal\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal\n  - Status: No ingredients to smelt\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when extracting items from entities\n- Ensure that the target entity, such as a wooden chest, contains the items you intend to extract. Double-check the entity's inventory before attempting extraction.\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied positions\n- Before placing an entity, verify that the target position is unoccupied. If an entity already exists at the intended position, consider adjusting the spacing or changing the direction to avoid collisions.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient resources\n- Maintain a sufficient supply of necessary resources, such as coal, to refuel entities like mining drills and inserters. Regularly check and replenish your inventory to prevent interruptions in operations."}
