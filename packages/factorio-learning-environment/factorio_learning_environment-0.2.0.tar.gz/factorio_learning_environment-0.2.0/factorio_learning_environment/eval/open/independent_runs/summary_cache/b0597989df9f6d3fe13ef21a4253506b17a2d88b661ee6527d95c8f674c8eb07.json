For example, attempting to place a stone furnace without having one in the inventory will result in an error.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient resources for crafting\n- Verify that you have enough resources before crafting. For instance, attempting to craft a stone furnace without sufficient stone will lead to an assertion error.\n\n### Errors when extracting items from entities\n- Ensure that the entity contains the items you are trying to extract. Repeated attempts to extract iron plates from the furnace when it does not contain any will result in extraction errors.\n\n### Errors due to lack of ingredients in production entities\n- Regularly check the status of production entities like furnaces to ensure they have the necessary ingredients to operate. A furnace with no ingredients will not produce any output and will generate warnings."}
