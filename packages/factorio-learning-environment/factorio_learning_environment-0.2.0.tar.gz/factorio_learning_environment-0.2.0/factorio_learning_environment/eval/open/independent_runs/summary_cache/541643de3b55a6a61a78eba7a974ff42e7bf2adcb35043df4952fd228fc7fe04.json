For example, avoid using 'position.position' which is incorrect.\n\n#### Errors in Entity Placement Distance\n- Move closer to the target position before attempting to place an entity if the distance exceeds the maximum allowable placement range.\n\n#### Errors in Inventory Management\n- Ensure that the necessary items are available in the inventory before attempting to place entities, such as boilers or steam engines."}
