Always ensure that transport belts are connected to an inserter that can accept items rather than directly to a Prototype.SteamEngine.\n\n\u2022 Placement Distance Error  \n  \u2013 Placing a wooden chest failed when the target position (e.g. Position(x=3.5, y=15.5)) was too far from the player\u2019s current position. Before placement, move close enough to the target tile so that placement falls within the allowed maximum distance.\n\n\u2022 Undefined Variable Errors  \n  \u2013 An error was raised due to use of an undefined variable (e.g. 'target_chest'). Verify variable names and ensure that all target entities are correctly defined before use."}
