{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (17.5, 20.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (17.5, 20.5) with warnings of 'no input liquid' and 'no fluid present in connections', status: NOT_CONNECTED.\n- Boiler at position (1.5, 23.0) with a warning of 'out of fuel', status: NO_FUEL.\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5), status: WORKING.\n- PipeGroup connecting various positions, including (3.5, 17.5) and (-9.5, 23.5), with fluid systems 73308 and 73319.\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at various positions, including (3.5, 20.5) and (21.5, 27.5), voltage: 0.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Steam Engine Not Receiving Input Liquid\n- Ensure that the steam engine is properly connected to a source of liquid. Check the connections and ensure there are no breaks in the pipeline.\n\n### Boiler Out of Fuel\n- Regularly check the fuel levels in the boiler to ensure continuous operation. Refuel as necessary to avoid interruptions in energy production.\n\n### Offshore Pump Fluid System Errors\n- Verify that the offshore pump is correctly connected to the pipeline system. Ensure there are no blockages or incorrect connections that might prevent water from reaching the boiler.\n\n### Errors When Using Extracting but Being Too Far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors When Placing into a Tile Which is Occupied by Another Entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
