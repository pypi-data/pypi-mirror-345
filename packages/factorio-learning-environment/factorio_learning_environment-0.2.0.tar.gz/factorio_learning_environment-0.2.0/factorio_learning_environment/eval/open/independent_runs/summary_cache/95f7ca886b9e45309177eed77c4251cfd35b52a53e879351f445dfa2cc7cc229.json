{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-19.0, -65.0) and (-21.0, -62.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (-19.0, -65.0) with a burner inserter at position (-20.5, -66.5) feeding it.\n- Furnace at position (-21.0, -62.0) with a burner inserter at position (-17.5, -64.5) feeding into a wooden chest at position (-16.5, -64.5).\n- Connected by a transport belt group from position (-21.5, -63.5) to (-21.5, -65.5).\n\n### Copper Ore Mining Facility at Position (-23.0, -68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) connected to a transport belt group from position (-23.5, -68.5) to (-23.5, -70.5).\n- Wooden chest at position (-24.5, -67.5) for storage.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Facility at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) connected to a wooden chest at position (-14.5, -54.5) for storage.\n\n### Miscellaneous Storage\n- Wooden chest at position (52.5, -84.5) containing coal.\n- Wooden chest at position (1.5, 0.5) containing coal and iron plates.\n- Wooden chest at position (3.5, 0.5) empty.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Using Inserters\n- Ensure that inserters are correctly positioned and have access to source items. The inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) is waiting for source items, indicating a potential misalignment or lack of input.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Fuel Management\n- Monitor furnace fuel levels to prevent overfilling. Both furnaces at positions (-19.0, -65.0) and (-21.0, -62.0) have warnings about full fuel sources, which can lead to inefficiencies.\n\n### Errors with Transport Belt Blockage\n- Regularly check transport belts for blockages and clear them promptly to maintain efficient material flow. The blockage at position (-23.5, -69.5) was successfully cleared, but ongoing monitoring is advised."}
