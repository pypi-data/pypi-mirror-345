{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-10.0, y=-48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-10.0, y=-48.0) fueled with coal and actively producing iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-8.5, y=-47.5) responsible for transferring iron plates from the furnace to a wooden chest at position (-7.5, y=-47.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (-7.5, y=-47.5) serving as storage for the produced iron plates.\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, y=-50.0) fueled with coal, extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, y=-48.5) collecting iron ore from the mining drill.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, y=-48.5) transferring iron ore from the chest to a stone furnace at position (-12.0, y=-48.0).\n- Stone Furnace at position (-12.0, y=-48.0) fueled with coal, processing iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-15.5, y=-48.5) serving as additional storage for iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-14.5, y=-47.5) transferring iron ore from the chest at position (-14.5, y=-46.5) to the furnace.\n\n### Iron Ore Storage\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, y=-46.5) storing iron ore for further processing.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Extracting Iron Plates from Non-Existent Chests\n- Ensure the target wooden chest exists and contains the required items before attempting extraction.\n\n### Errors due to Lack of Coal in Inventory\n- Maintain a sufficient supply of coal in your inventory to refuel mining drills and furnaces.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Check that the source entities have the necessary items available for inserters to transfer.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Space in Destination\n- Ensure that the destination entity has enough space to accommodate items being transferred by inserters."}
