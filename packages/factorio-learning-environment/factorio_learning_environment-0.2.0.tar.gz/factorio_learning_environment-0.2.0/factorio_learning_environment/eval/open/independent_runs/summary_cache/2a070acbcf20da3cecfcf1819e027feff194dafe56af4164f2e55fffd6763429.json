{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at Position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (2 units)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Warnings: Output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Drop Position: (x=-16.5, y=-52.5)\n  - Resources: Iron Ore (40,000 units)\n  - Neighbours: Stone Furnace at Position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)\n- **Stone Furnace** at Position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (14 units)\n  - Status: No Ingredients\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Furnace Result: Iron Plate (60 units)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied or invalid locations\n- Ensure you can place an entity at the desired tile before attempting placement. This includes checking for existing entities or obstructions at the target location.\n\n### Errors when moving entities to new locations\n- Verify that the target location is valid and unoccupied before attempting to move an entity there.\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities from specific positions\n- Confirm that the entity type exists at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it. This can be done by checking the map or using a function to verify the entity's presence.\n\n### Errors due to blocked output from drills\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity, such as a chest or belt, to accept the output from drills to prevent blockage.\n\n### Errors due to missing ingredients in furnaces\n- Regularly supply the furnace with the necessary ingredients to maintain production and avoid status warnings related to missing ingredients."}
