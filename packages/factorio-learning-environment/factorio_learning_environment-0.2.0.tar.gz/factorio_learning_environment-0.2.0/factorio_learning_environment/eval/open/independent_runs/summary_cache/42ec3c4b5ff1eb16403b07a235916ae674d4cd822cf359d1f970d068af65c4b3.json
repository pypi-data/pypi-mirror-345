{"content": "# FACTORIO REPORT\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System at position (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump (position x=-9.5, y=-0.5)\n- Boiler (position x=-5.0, y=2.5)\n- Steam engine (position x=0.5, y=6.5)\n- Pipe network connecting these components\n- Central power pole (position x=0.5, y=10.5)\n\nThis structure generates electricity for the factory by pumping water from a nearby water source, heating it in the boiler using coal to produce steam, which then powers the steam engine. The agent has been regularly adding coal to the boiler to maintain power generation, with a throughput of approximately 740 water/steam per minute when operating properly. The boiler currently has 28 coal and is working properly.\n\n### Stone Mining Operation at position (-50.0, 13.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill 1 (position x=-48.5, y=7.5) with wooden chest (position x=-48.5, y=9.5)\n- Electric mining drill 2 (position x=-51.5, y=12.5) with wooden chest (position x=-51.5, y=14.5)\n- Electric mining drill 3 (position x=-48.5, y=16.5) with wooden chest (position x=-48.5, y=18.5)\n- Electric mining drill 4 (position x=-52.5, y=18.5) with wooden chest (position x=-52.5, y=20.5)\n- Small electric poles connecting the drills to the power network\n\nThis structure mines stone from several stone patches and deposits it into adjacent wooden chests for storage. The mining operation produces stone at varying rates between 120-172 stone per minute when operational. Current stone amounts in chests:\n- Chest at x=-48.5, y=9.5: 645 stone\n- Chest at x=-51.5, y=14.5: 681 stone\n- Chest at x=-48.5, y=18.5: 621 stone\n- Chest at x=-52.5, y=20.5: 680 stone\n\nThe mining drills are currently operational and connected to power.\n\n### Stone Brick Production Line at position (-20.0, 35.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace 1 (position x=-30.0, y=35.0) with output inserter (position x=-29.5, y=36.5)\n- Stone furnace 2 (position x=-25.0, y=35.0) with output inserter (position x=-24.5, y=36.5)\n- Stone furnace 3 (position x=-20.0, y=35.0) with output inserter (position x=-19.5, y=36.5)\n- Stone furnace 4 (position x=-15.0, y=35.0) with output inserter (position x=-14.5, y=36.5)\n- Stone furnace 5 (position x=-10.0, y=35.0) with output inserter (position x=-9.5, y=36.5)\n- Input belt segments at x=-34.5, y=33.5 and other positions\n- Output belt segments at x=-34.5, y=37.5 and other positions\n- Small electric poles powering the inserters at positions x=-23.5, y=36.5; x=-18.5, y=36.5; and x=-13.5, y=36.5\n- Stone brick collection chest (position x=-19.5, y=38.5)\n- Inserter at x=-19.5, y=39.5 to move stone bricks from collection chest to belt\n- Transport belt line from x=-19.5, y=40.5 to x=-19.5, y=45.5, then turning right to x=-17.5, y=45.5\n\nThis structure smelts stone into stone bricks. The furnaces are fueled with coal and each has some stone bricks ready for extraction. The furnaces are currently waiting for more stone to smelt. A new addition is the stone brick collection chest and belt system that transports stone bricks from the production line to the stone wall assembling machine.\n\n### Stone Wall Production"}
