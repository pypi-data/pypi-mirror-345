{"content": "# Factorio Execution Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position 0.0, 0.0)\n- Stone furnace (position 2.0, 0.0)\n- Stone furnace (position 2.0, 2.0)\n\n### Lab at position (10.5, 10.5)\nConsists of the following entity:\n- Lab (position 10.5, 10.5)\n\n### Wooden Chest at position (5.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entity:\n- Wooden chest (position 5.5, 0.5)\n\n### Electricity Group at position (12.93, 10.71)\nConsists of the following entity:\n- Electricity group (position 12.93, 10.71)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when trying to access entities at incorrect positions\n- Ensure that the specified position for accessing an entity is correct. For example, the lab was attempted to be accessed at (6.0, 0.0) but was not found there. Verify the coordinates before making such calls.\n\n### Errors when using entities without power\n- Check that all entities requiring power are properly connected to an electric network. The lab at (10.5, 10.5) reported a status of NO_POWER, indicating it needs to be connected to a power source.\n\n### Errors when entities are not plugged into the electric network\n- Ensure that all electrical devices are connected to the electric network. The electricity group at (12.93, 10.71) reported NOT_PLUGGED_IN_ELECTRIC_NETWORK. Verify connections and ensure that the network is properly set up.\n\n### Errors when entities have no ingredients\n- Ensure that all furnaces and similar entities have the necessary ingredients to operate. The status of the furnaces indicates NO_INGREDIENTS, which means they require input resources to function."}
