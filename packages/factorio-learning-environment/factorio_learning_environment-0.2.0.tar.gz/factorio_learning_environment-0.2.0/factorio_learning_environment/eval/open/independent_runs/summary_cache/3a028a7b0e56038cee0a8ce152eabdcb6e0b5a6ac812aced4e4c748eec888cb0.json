The extract_item function fails when the requested quantity exceeds the available quantity. Ensure the chest contains enough items before attempting to extract.\n\n### Incorrect argument type for harvest_resource function\n- The harvest_resource function expects a Position object as the first argument, but it received a resource object instead. Ensure that you are passing the correct type of argument to the function.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Variables\n- No new variables were assigned.\n```"}
