{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnaces**: \n  - Stone furnace at position (x=-15.0, y=-48.0)\n  - Stone furnace at position (x=-13.0, y=-48.0)\n  - Stone furnace at position (x=-11.0, y=-48.0)\n- **Iron Chest**: \n  - Iron chest at position (x=-5.5, y=-50.5) for storing iron plates\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill**:\n  - Burner mining drill at position (x=4.0, y=-60.0) fueled with coal\n- **Wooden Chests**:\n  - Wooden chest at position (x=4.5, y=-58.5) for storing extracted iron ore\n  - Multiple additional wooden chests in the vicinity for overflow storage\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Full Inventory\n- Ensure that storage chests have sufficient space before continuing mining operations. The chest at position (4.5, -58.5) is full, preventing further mining.\n\n### Errors with No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Ensure that furnaces are continuously supplied with raw materials (iron ore) to prevent downtime. The furnaces at positions (x=-15.0, y=-48.0), (x=-13.0, y=-48.0), and (x=-11.0, y=-48.0) are currently without ingredients.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- None defined in the execution logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `iron_ore_count`: int = 124\n- `iron_plate_count`: int = 4518\n- `iron_gear_wheel_count`: int = 4\n- `wood_count`: int = 10\n\nNo utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided logs."}
