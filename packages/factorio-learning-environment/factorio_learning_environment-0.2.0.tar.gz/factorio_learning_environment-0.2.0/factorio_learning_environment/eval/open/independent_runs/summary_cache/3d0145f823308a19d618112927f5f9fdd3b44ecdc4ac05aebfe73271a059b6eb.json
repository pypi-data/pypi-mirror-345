{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Electricity generator at position(x=117.5, y=-30.5)\nConsists of steam engine(position x=117.5, y=-30.5), boiler(position x=111.5, y=-32.0), offshore pump(position x=106.5, y=-32.5), and pipe groups(positions x=107.5, y=-34.5 and x=105.5, y=-32.5)\n\n### Furnace at position(x=60.0, y=-60.0)\nConsists of a stone furnace(position x=60.0, y=-60.0)\n\n### Transport belt at position(x=63.5, y=-53.5)\nConsists of two transport belts(positions x=63.5, y=-53.5 and x=64.5, y=-53.5)\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n### Errors when using connect_entities function\n- Ensure that the entities are compatible and can be connected before calling the function.\n- Check that the entities are not already connected to other entities in a way that would prevent the connection.\n\n### Errors when printing boiler status\n- Avoid infinite recursion when printing the boiler status by ensuring that the print statement is not called repeatedly without a base case.\n- Consider using a loop or a conditional statement to limit the number of times the boiler status is printed.\n\n### Errors when inserting coal into boiler\n- Make sure that the boiler is not already full of fuel before attempting to insert more coal.\n- Check that the coal is being inserted into the correct entity (the boiler) and not into another entity.\n\n# NAMESPACE\n- `insert_item_into_entity`: a function that inserts an item into an entity. It has been invoked with `boiler` as the entity and `coal` as the item.\n- `connect_entities`: a function that connects two entities. It has been invoked with `steam_engine` and `offshore_pump` as the entities.\n- `get_entity`: a function that retrieves an entity from the map. It has been invoked with `entity.prototype` and `entity.position` as arguments.\n- Important variables:\n  - `boiler`: an entity representing a boiler, type `Boiler`\n  - `steam_engine`: an entity representing a steam engine, type `Generator`\n  - `offshore_pump`: an entity representing an offshore pump, type `OffshorePump`\n  - `coal`: an item representing coal, type `Item`"}
