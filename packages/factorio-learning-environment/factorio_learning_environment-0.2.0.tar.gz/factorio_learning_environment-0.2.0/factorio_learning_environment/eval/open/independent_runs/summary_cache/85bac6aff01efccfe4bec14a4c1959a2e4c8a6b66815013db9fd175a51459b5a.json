{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Iron Plate Production Line at y=1.0\nConsists of two stone furnaces working in parallel with automated output collection:\n- Stone furnace at position (1.0, 1.0) - working with 28 coal and 7 iron ore\n- Stone furnace at position (3.0, 1.0) - working with 40 coal and 6 iron ore\n- Burner inserter at position (1.5, 2.5) - configured to extract from first furnace, 38 coal\n- Burner inserter at position (3.5, 2.5) - configured to extract from second furnace, 18 coal\n- Collection chest at position (1.5, 3.5) - containing 67 iron plates\n- Collection chest at position (3.5, 3.5) - containing 52 iron plates\n\n### Copper Plate Production Line at y=7.0\nConsists of two stone furnaces working in parallel with automated output collection:\n- Stone furnace at position (2.0, 7.0) - idle with 41 coal, no ingredients\n- Stone furnace at position (4.0, 7.0) - working with 21 coal and 16 copper ore\n- Burner inserter at position (2.5, 8.5) - configured to extract from first furnace, 19 coal\n- Burner inserter at position (4.5, 8.5) - configured to extract from second furnace, 19 coal\n- Collection chest at position (2.5, 9.5) - containing 40 copper plates\n- Collection chest at position (4.5, 9.5) - containing 36 copper plates\n\nERROR TIPS\n### Errors when placing entities without required items\n- Check inventory before attempting to place entities\n- Ensure you have crafted or collected the required items before placement\n\n### Errors when placing entities in invalid locations\n- Verify the target location is valid before placing entities\n- Some locations may be blocked by other entities or terrain\n- Consider checking if the target position overlaps with existing structures\n- Use appropriate spacing between entities to avoid placement conflicts\n\n### Errors with resource management\n- Keep track of resource quantities in inventory\n- Ensure sufficient resources are collected before attempting to supply multiple machines\n- Consider collecting additional resources when inventory runs low on critical items\n- Craft required building components before starting new construction projects\n\n### Errors when inserting items without having them in inventory\n- Verify item availability in inventory before attempting insertion operations\n- Recent examples: Attempted to insert coal into inserter without having coal in inventory\n- Double check inventory contents match the intended insertion material\n- Maintain minimum stock levels of critical resources like coal for refueling operations"}
