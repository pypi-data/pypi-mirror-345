{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-4.5, 23.0)\nConsists of boiler (position -4.5, 23.0), steam engine (position -0.5, -9.5), and offshore pump (position -9.5, 24.5). The boiler is currently out of fuel and not connected to a power network, while the offshore pump is working and supplying water.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 0, 0) and a furnace (position 0, 0)\n- Burner mining drill (position 5, 5) and a furnace (position 5, 5)\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine at position(z1) and inserter at position(a) that puts into assembling machine\n- Beltgroup that connects the furnace at position y1 to assembling machine at position(z1)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when trying to get a boiler entity\n- Ensure that the boiler is placed correctly at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it. The error indicates that there is no boiler entity at the given coordinates.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
