{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Wooden Chest at position(-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest (position -14.5, -48.5) containing iron-ore.\n\n### Stone Furnace at position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace (position 0.0, 0.0) that is currently working and contains iron-plate and iron-ore.\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position(42.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position 42.0, -83.0) which is currently out of fuel.\n\n### Burner Inserter at position(42.5, -80.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Inserter (position 42.5, -80.5) that is waiting for source items.\n\n### Burner Inserter at position(43.5, -81.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Inserter (position 43.5, -81.5) that is waiting for space in destination.\n\n### Wooden Chest at position(42.5, -81.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest (position 42.5, -81.5) containing coal.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to fuel supply\n- Ensure that all burner entities (e.g., burner-mining-drill, stone-furnace) have sufficient fuel before operation. Regularly check and refill fuel supplies to avoid \"NO_FUEL\" status.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into the Stone Furnace\n- The Stone Furnace may show \"NO_INGREDIENTS\" status if it lacks the necessary materials (iron-ore or coal). Ensure that you have the required ingredients in your inventory before attempting to insert them.\n\n### Errors related to inserter operations\n- If inserters are waiting for source items or space in destination, verify that the source (e.g., wooden chest) has items available and that the destination (e.g., stone furnace) has space for new items.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n#### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the current execution steps.\n\n#### Important Variables\n- `iron-ore`: int\n- `coal`: int\n- `iron-plate`: int\n- `wood`: int\n- `iron-gear-wheel`: int"}
