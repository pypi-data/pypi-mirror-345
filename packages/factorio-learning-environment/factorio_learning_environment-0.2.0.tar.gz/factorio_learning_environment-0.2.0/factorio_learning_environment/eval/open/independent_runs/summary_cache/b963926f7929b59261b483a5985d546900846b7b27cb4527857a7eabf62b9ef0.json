Check your inventory for required materials.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity on a tile before attempting to place it.\n\n### Errors related to furnace status\n- Check the ingredient availability for furnaces to avoid the \"NO_INGREDIENTS\" status. Ensure that the necessary raw materials are fed into the furnaces."}
