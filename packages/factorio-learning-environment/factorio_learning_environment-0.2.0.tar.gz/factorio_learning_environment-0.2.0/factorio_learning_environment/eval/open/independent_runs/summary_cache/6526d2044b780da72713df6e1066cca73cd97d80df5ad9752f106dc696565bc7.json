{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-9.5, 24.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Boiler at position (-2.5, 24.0)\n- PipeGroup connecting Offshore Pump to Boiler with pipes at positions [(x=-8.5, y=23.5), (x=-9.5, y=23.5), (x=-6.5, y=23.5),...,(x=-4.5, y=23.5), (x=-5.5, y=23.5), (x=-4.5, y=24.5)]\n\n### Iron Plate Smelting Facility at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities\n- Ensure you can place an entity on a tile before attempting placement. The error with placing the boiler next to the offshore pump suggests a collision with existing entities or unsuitable terrain (e.g., water). Consider increasing spacing, changing direction, or changing the reference position.\n\n### TypeError in BuildingBox Calculations\n- When calculating dimensions for BuildingBox, ensure that you are using compatible data types. The error indicates an unsupported operand type when adding 'ModelPrivateAttr' and 'int'. Verify that the attributes used in calculations are of the correct type.\n\n### NameError for Undefined Variables\n- Ensure all variables are defined before use. The error with 'steam_engine' and 'steam_engine_buildable_area' suggests these variables were not initialized. Double-check variable names and initialization.\n\n### Crafting and Inventory Management Errors\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to craft or insert them. The error with crafting pipes indicates insufficient iron plates. Similarly, ensure you have coal in your inventory before attempting to insert it into the boiler.\n\n### Extraction Errors\n- Verify that the target entity contains the items you wish to extract. The error with extracting iron plates from the stone furnace suggests the furnace did not contain the specified items. Ensure the furnace is correctly loaded and operational."}
