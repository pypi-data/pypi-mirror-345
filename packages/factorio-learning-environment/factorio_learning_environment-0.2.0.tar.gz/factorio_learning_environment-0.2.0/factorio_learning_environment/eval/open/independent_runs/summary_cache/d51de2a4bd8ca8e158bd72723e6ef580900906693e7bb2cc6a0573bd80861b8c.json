{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-29.5, 30.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position -29.5, 30.5) and boiler (position -24.5, -50.0). The boiler is connected to an offshore pump (position -10.5, 25.5) through a pipe system.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(-18.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position x1) and a furnace at position(-18.0, -49.0)\n- Furnace (position -18.0, -49.0) is currently not smelting due to lack of ingredients.\n\n### Lab at position(-10.5, -10.5)\nCurrently not generating power.\n\n### Offshore pump at position(-10.5, 25.5)\nConnected to the boiler at position(-24.5, -50.0) and is functioning properly.\n\n### Pipe system\nConsists of multiple pipes connecting the boiler and steam engine, specifically:\n- Pipe connections from boiler (position -24.5, -50.0) to steam engine (position -29.5, 30.5).\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting boiler to steam engine\n- Ensure the pipes are correctly placed and connected. Verify the coordinates and ensure there are no obstacles between the boiler and steam engine.\n\n### Errors when placing lab\n- Ensure that the lab is placed in a location where it can receive power. Check the surrounding area for power connections.\n\n### Errors when steam engine is not generating power\n- Check the connections and ensure that the boiler is properly filled with water and coal. Verify that the steam engine is connected to a power network.\n\n### Errors when entities are not found\n- Double-check the coordinates when placing entities to ensure they are within valid ranges and not overlapping with existing structures."}
