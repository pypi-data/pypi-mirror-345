{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (61.0, -54.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (61.0, -54.0) with a fuel inventory of coal and a full output of iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (61.5, -52.5) storing coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (62.5, -53.5) storing coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (62.5, -52.5) storing coal.\n\n### Coal Mining and Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) extracting coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (41.5, -83.5) transferring coal from the mining drill to the adjacent wooden chests.\n- Wooden Chest at position (40.5, -83.5) storing coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (42.5, -83.5) storing coal.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities without required items\n- Ensure that the inventory contains the necessary items before attempting to place an entity. For example, attempting to place a stone furnace without having one in the inventory will result in a placement error.\n\n### Warnings related to full output in furnaces\n- Regularly monitor the output inventory of furnaces to prevent them from becoming full, which halts production. Consider using inserters to automatically transfer items from the furnace to a storage chest.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `place_entity(entity_type: Prototype, position: Position)`: Attempts to place a specified entity at a given position. Ensure the inventory contains the entity before invoking this function to avoid placement errors.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `new_furnace_position: Position` - Intended position for placing a new stone furnace.\n- `current_inventory: dict` - Tracks the current inventory of the agent, including items like wood, coal, and iron plates."}
