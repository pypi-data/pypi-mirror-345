{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage at Position (x=53.0, y=-83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=53.0, y=-83.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=52.5, y=-84.5)\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Storage at Position (x=-23.0, y=-68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-23.0, y=-68.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=-23.5, y=-69.5)\n- Transport Belt group connecting various positions for ore movement\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage at Position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-54.5)\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-54.5) moving items from the chest to another Wooden Chest at position (x=-12.5, y=-54.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (x=-21.0, y=-62.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-21.0, y=-62.0) with a Wooden Chest at position (x=-20.5, y=-63.5) for storing iron plates\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with a Wooden Chest at position (x=1.5, y=0.5) for storing iron plates\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=2.5, y=0.5) moving items from a Wooden Chest at position (x=3.5, y=0.5) to the furnace\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Attribute Errors with BeltGroup Objects\n- Ensure that when filtering entities by prototype, the entities being checked have the 'prototype' attribute. BeltGroup objects do not have this attribute, so they should be excluded from such operations.\n\n### Errors in Retrieving Entities at Specific Positions\n- Verify the existence of entities at specified positions before attempting to retrieve them. The error suggests an attempt to get a Burner Mining Drill at a position where none exists. Use checks or conditionals to ensure the entity is present before accessing it.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source items are available for the inserters to pick up. This can be resolved by checking the inventory of the source chest or ensuring that the production line feeding into the inserter is operational.\n\n### Chest Full Warnings\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are full to prevent interruptions in the production line. This is particularly important for chests connected to mining drills and inserters, as full chests can halt operations.\n\n### Furnace No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Ensure that furnaces have a continuous supply of raw materials to smelt. This can be achieved by checking the input chests or belts feeding into the furnace to ensure they are stocked with the necessary ingredients."}
