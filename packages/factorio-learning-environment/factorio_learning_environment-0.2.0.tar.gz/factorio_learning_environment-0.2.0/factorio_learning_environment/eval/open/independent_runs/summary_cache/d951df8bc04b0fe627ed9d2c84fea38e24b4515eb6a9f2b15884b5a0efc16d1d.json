{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Plate Production Line at position(x=52.0, y=-79.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position(x=52.0, y=-79.0) (no ingredients to smelt)\n- **Burner Inserter** at position(x=53.5, y=-79.5) (out of fuel)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position(x=54.5, y=-79.5) (contains iron plates)\n\n#### Iron Ore Mine at position(x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position(x=-15.0, y=-50.0) (out of fuel, chest at drop position is full)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position(x=-14.5, y=-48.5) (empty)\n- **Burner Inserter** at position(x=-13.5, y=-48.5) (waiting for source items)\n\n#### Storage Area at position(x=0.5, y=0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Wooden Chest** at position(x=0.5, y=0.5) (contains various items)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position(x=1.5, y=0.5) (contains various items)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position(x=2.5, y=0.5) (contains coal)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position(x=3.5, y=0.5) (contains coal)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position(x=4.5, y=0.5) (contains coal and iron ore)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position(x=5.5, y=0.5) (contains iron ore, iron plates, and iron gear wheels)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Mining Drill Not Working\n- **Issue**: The mining drill at position(x=-15.0, y=-50.0) is not working due to lack of fuel and a full chest at the drop position.\n- **Solution**: Ensure the mining drill has sufficient fuel and that the chest at the drop position is not full. Empty the chest or add more storage capacity.\n\n#### Burner Inserter Out of Fuel\n- **Issue**: The burner inserter at position(x=53.5, y=-79.5) is out of fuel.\n- **Solution**: Add fuel (e.g., coal) to the burner inserter to restore its functionality.\n\n#### Furnace No Ingredients\n- **Issue**: The stone furnace at position(x=52.0, y=-79.0) has no ingredients to smelt.\n- **Solution**: Ensure that the furnace is supplied with the necessary raw materials (e.g., iron ore) and fuel (e.g., coal) for smelting.\n\n#### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- **Issue**: The burner inserter at position(x=42.5, y=-80.5) is waiting for source items.\n- **Solution**: Ensure that the source chest has items to be picked up by the inserter.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n#### Utility Functions\n- **None defined yet**\n\n#### Important Variables\n- **None assigned yet**"}
