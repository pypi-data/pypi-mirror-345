{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo structures have been successfully created on the map as of the latest execution steps. All attempts to place entities have resulted in errors, indicating no existing structures are present.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied or invalid tiles\n- Ensure that the target tile is clear and suitable for placing the desired entity. Use map checks to confirm that the position is unoccupied before attempting placement.\n- Avoid attempting to place entities at positions that are already occupied or invalid, such as x=5.0 y=5.0, x=-50.0 y=50.0, x=0.0 y=10.0, x=10.0 y=0.0, x=-100.0 y=100.0, and x=0.0 y=0.0.\n\n### Errors related to unclear placement positions\n- Verify that the area surrounding the intended placement position is clear. This includes checking adjacent tiles to ensure they are not obstructed. Positions such as x=-0.5 y=-0.5, x=-0.5 y=0.5, x=-0.5 y=1.5, x=0.5 y=-0.5, x=0.5 y=0.5, x=0.5 y=1.5, x=1.5 y=-0.5, x=1.5 y=0.5, and x=1.5 y=1.5 have been identified as not clear for placement."}
