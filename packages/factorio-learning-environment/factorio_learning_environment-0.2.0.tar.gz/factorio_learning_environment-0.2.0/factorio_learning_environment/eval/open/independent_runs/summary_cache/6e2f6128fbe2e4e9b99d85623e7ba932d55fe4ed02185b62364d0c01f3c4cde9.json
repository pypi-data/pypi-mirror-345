{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -49.0) used for smelting iron ore into iron plates. Currently, it has no fuel and contains 12 iron ore and 70 iron plates.\n\n### Mining and Transport System at Position (42.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (42.0, -83.0) with fuel inventory of coal, currently waiting for space in the destination due to blocked output.\n- Burner Inserter at position (42.5, -81.5) with fuel inventory of coal, currently waiting for source items due to a full chest.\n- Transport Belt verified at positions (43.5, -82.5) and (43.5, -80.5), aligned correctly for item transport.\n- BeltGroup connecting the mining drill and inserter, with belts running from (42.5, -82.5) to (44.5, -82.5) and from (43.5, -81.5) to (43.5, -79.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Ensure the target tile is unoccupied before attempting to place an entity such as a Wooden Chest or Burner Inserter. Check for existing entities or obstructions.\n\n### Output blockage in mining drills\n- Ensure there is a sink entity or clear path for the output of mining drills to prevent blockage. Regularly check and clear any items blocking the output path.\n\n### Inserter waiting for source items\n- Verify that the source entity is supplying items to the inserter. Ensure that the source entity is not full or blocked, and that the inserter is correctly positioned to pick up items.\n\n### Furnace out of fuel\n- Regularly refuel furnaces to maintain continuous production. Monitor fuel levels and ensure a steady supply of fuel to avoid production halts."}
