{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report (Updated)\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generation system at x=-25.0 y=80.5\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at x=-20.5 y=69.5 (now connected with 15 pipes)\n- Boiler at x=-25.0 y=80.5 (working with coal fuel)\n- Steam engine at x=-25.5 y=89.5 (now connected with 12 pipes, producing 15000 power)\n- Pipe networks:\n  - Water system connecting pump to boiler (now functional)\n  - Steam system connecting boiler to engine (now functional)\n\n### Copper mining operation at x=-55.5 y=70.5\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill at x=-55.5 y=70.5 (output blocked, no power)\n- Missing burner inserter at x=-55.5 y=72.5 (previously existed but now missing)\n- Stone furnace at x=-55.0 y=75.0 (no ingredients)\n- Wooden chest at x=-55.5 y=76.5 (empty output storage)\n- Small electric pole placement attempts failed (blocked by existing objects)\n\n### Iron mining operation at x=15.5 y=70.5\n(No changes from previous report)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill at x=15.5 y=70.5 (currently no power)\n- Stone furnace at x=16.0 y=74.0 (no ingredients)\n- Burner inserter at x=15.5 y=72.5 (working)\n- Wooden chest at x=15.5 y=75.5 (empty output storage)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Power network issues\n- Complete power network connections (steam engine now connected but still shows \"not connected to power network\")\n- Resolve small electric pole placement issues (multiple failed attempts at x=-55.5,70.5 and x=-25.5,89.5)\n- Verify power pole placement positions (existing objects blocking placement)\n\n### Entity management\n- Implement entity existence verification (burner inserter missing at x=-55.5 y=72.5)\n- Track entity state changes (missing inserter not detected)\n- Clear output blockages (copper drill still blocked at x=-55.5 y=70.5)\n\n### Placement distance errors\n- Move closer before placing entities (repeated small electric pole placement failures)\n- Implement distance checks before placement attempts\n- Verify clear space before placement (multiple \"existing object in the way\" errors)\n\n### Production chain monitoring\n- Supply ingredients to furnace (stone furnace at x=-55.0 y=75.0 still has no ingredients)\n- Verify inserter functionality (missing inserter affecting production chain)\n- Monitor fuel levels in boilers and furnaces\n\n### System verification\n- Implement connection status verification (steam engine shows connected but status says NOT_CONNECTED)\n- Verify fluid systems (boiler shows \"no input liquid\" despite connections)\n- Monitor power production and consumption metrics"}
