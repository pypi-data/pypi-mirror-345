Consider adjusting the spacing or changing the direction to avoid collisions.\n\n### Errors when Extracting Items\n- Make sure that the chest contains the items you are trying to extract. Double-check the item type and quantity available in the chest before attempting extraction.\n\n### Errors in Code Execution\n- Ensure that all variables and functions are correctly defined and accessible. For instance, verify that 'prototype_by_title' is defined or correctly referenced as 'prototype_by_name'.\n- Avoid using incorrect object attributes, such as treating a string as an object with attributes. Double-check the data types and object structures in your code.\n\n### Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entities have the necessary items available for the inserters to function. If an inserter is waiting for items, check the upstream supply chain to ensure items are being produced and transported correctly.\n\n### Furnaces Missing Ingredients\n- Regularly supply the furnaces with the necessary raw materials to prevent production delays. Monitor the inventory levels and automate the supply chain to maintain a steady flow of ingredients."}
