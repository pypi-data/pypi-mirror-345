Check if the required machine is available and properly set up before attempting to craft.\n  \n- **Errors when inserting fuel into a full chest**\n  - Make sure to empty the chest at (-14.5, -48.5) to continue mining. If the drop position is full, the mining drill will not be able to insert resources.\n\n- **Errors when using extracting but being too far**\n  - Move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n- **Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity**\n  - Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n- **Utility Functions Defined:**\n  - `craft_item(Prototype.IronPlate, quantity=5)`: Failed due to not having a crafting machine or smelting in a furnace.\n  \n- **Important Variables Assigned:**\n  - `crafting_machine`: type `bool`\n  - `inventory`: type `dict`\n  - `coal`: type `int`\n  - `iron_ore`: type `int`\n  - `iron_plate`: type `int`\n  - `iron_gear_wheel`: type `int`"}
