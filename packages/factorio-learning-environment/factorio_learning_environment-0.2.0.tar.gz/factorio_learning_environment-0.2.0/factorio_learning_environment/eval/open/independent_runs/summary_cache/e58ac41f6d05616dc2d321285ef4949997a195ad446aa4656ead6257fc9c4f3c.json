{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production at (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-15.0, -50.0) mining iron ore\n- Stone furnace at (-14.0, -48.0) smelting iron plates\nCurrently working and producing iron plates, but output is blocked due to items on ground\n\n### Iron Plate Production at (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace at (0.0, 0.0)\n- Stone furnace at (2.0, 0.0)\nBoth furnaces have fuel but no ingredients to smelt\n\n### Copper Plate Production at (4.0, 4.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace at (4.0, 4.0) actively smelting copper ore\n- Stone furnace at (6.0, 4.0) with fuel but no ingredients\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Distance Errors\n- Stay within 10 tiles of where you want to place entities\n- Move closer to target location before attempting to place structures\n\n### Inventory Management Errors\n- Check inventory for required items before attempting to place or insert\n- Ensure you have necessary materials (coal, ore, stone furnace) before starting construction\n\n### Resource Insertion Errors\n- Verify you have the required resources in inventory before attempting to insert into machines\n- Keep track of fuel (coal) levels and restock when running low\n\n### Entity Output Blocking\n- Ensure there is a way to collect output from mining drills (either storage or transport belt)\n- Clear blocked outputs to maintain production efficiency\n\n### API Usage Errors\n- Use correct data types when calling GetEntities function\n- Handle entity state queries properly to avoid stale data issues\n\n### Crafting Prerequisites\n- Ensure all required ingredients are available before attempting to craft items\n- For items requiring machine assembly, build appropriate production facilities first"}
