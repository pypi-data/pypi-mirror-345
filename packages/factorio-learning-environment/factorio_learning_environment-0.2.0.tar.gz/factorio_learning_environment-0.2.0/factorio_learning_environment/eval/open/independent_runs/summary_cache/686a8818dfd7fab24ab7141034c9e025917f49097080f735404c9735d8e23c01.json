{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Setup at position (x=2.0, y=-63.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner mining drill** at position (x=2.0, y=-63.0) extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden chest** at position (x=2.5, y=-61.5) for storing extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner inserter** at position (x=3.5, y=-61.5) transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone furnace** at position (x=4.0, y=-63.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Wooden chest** at position (x=4.5, y=-61.5) for storing iron plates.\n\n#### Additional Stone Furnace at position (x=6.0, y=-63.0)\n- **Stone furnace** at position (x=6.0, y=-63.0) currently idle due to lack of ingredients.\n\n---\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when extracting items from a furnace\n- **Issue**: Repeated errors when attempting to extract iron plates from the furnace at position (x=4.0, y=-63.0). The furnace may not have enough plates to extract or the extraction logic may be flawed.\n- **Solution**: Ensure the furnace has sufficient iron plates before attempting extraction. Verify the extraction logic to handle cases where the furnace output is empty.\n\n#### Inefficient inserter operation\n- **Issue**: The burner inserter at position (x=3.5, y=-61.5) is waiting for source items and reports that the chest is full.\n- **Solution**: Ensure the chest at (x=2.5, y=-61.5) has sufficient space for incoming items. Consider upgrading to a faster inserter or adding additional chests for overflow.\n\n#### Furnace warnings\n- **Issue**: The furnace at position (x=4.0, y=-63.0) occasionally reports \"no ingredients to smelt.\"\n- **Solution**: Ensure a steady supply of iron ore and coal to the furnace. Check the inserter's operation and fuel supply to avoid interruptions.\n\n#### General tips\n- Monitor the fuel levels in all burner-based entities (mining drills, furnaces, and inserters) to prevent downtime.\n- Expand the setup to include additional furnaces and mining drills to increase production capacity."}
