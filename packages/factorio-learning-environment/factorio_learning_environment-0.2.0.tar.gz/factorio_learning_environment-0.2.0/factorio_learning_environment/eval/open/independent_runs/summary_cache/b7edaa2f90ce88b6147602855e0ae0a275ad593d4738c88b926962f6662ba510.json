Check the terrain and surrounding entities to confirm the placement area is clear.\n\n### Unsuitable Terrain for Placement\n- Verify that the terrain is suitable for placing the intended structure or entity. Some terrains may not support certain types of entities, so ensure compatibility before attempting placement."}
