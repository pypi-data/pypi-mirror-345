{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line at Position (-13.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-9.0, -48.0)\n- Burner Inserter at position (-12.5, -44.5) extracting iron plates from furnace at (-13.0, -48.0)\n- Burner Inserter at position (-10.5, -44.5) extracting iron plates from furnace at (-11.0, -48.0)\n- Burner Inserter at position (-8.5, -44.5) extracting iron plates from furnace at (-9.0, -48.0)\n\n### Coal and Iron Ore Mining Site at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (43.0, -82.0)\n- Iron Chest at position (41.5, -80.5)\n- Iron Chest at position (42.5, -80.5)\n- Burner Inserter at position (43.5, -80.5)\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Site at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0)\n- Iron Chest at position (-16.5, -48.5)\n- Iron Chest at position (-15.5, -48.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Insufficient Inventory\n- Ensure you have enough iron ore in your inventory before attempting to supply furnaces. Repeated errors occurred when trying to supply furnaces at positions (-13.0, -48.0), (-11.0, -48.0), and (-9.0, -48.0) without sufficient iron ore.\n\n### Errors When Placing Inserters\n- When placing inserters, ensure there is enough space and the direction is correct. Errors occurred when trying to place burner-inserters next to furnaces due to existing structures blocking the placement. Consider increasing spacing or changing the direction.\n\n### Errors in Connecting Belts\n- Belts cannot be directly connected to furnaces. Use an inserter to take items from a furnace to a belt line. This error was encountered when attempting to connect furnaces directly to a belt line.\n\n### Errors When Refueling Inserters\n- Ensure the correct position of inserters when refueling. An error occurred when attempting to refuel a burner-inserter at position (41.5, -80.5) due to incorrect entity positioning.\n\nBy addressing these errors, efficiency in resource management and structure placement can be significantly improved."}
