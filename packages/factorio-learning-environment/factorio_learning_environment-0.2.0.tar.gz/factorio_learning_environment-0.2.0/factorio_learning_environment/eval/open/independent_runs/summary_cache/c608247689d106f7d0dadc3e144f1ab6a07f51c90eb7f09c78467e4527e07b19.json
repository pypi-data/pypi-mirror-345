This structure (a furnace unit located at (5.0, 5.0)) was employed during the recovery update for enabling lab crafting by increasing the iron-plate count.\n\n### Copper Smelting Furnace at Position (-27.0, -60.0)\nUsed to process copper ore into copper plates. The furnace unit at (\u201327.0, \u201360.0) is dedicated to copper plate production, which is a prerequisite for generating copper cables needed in subsequent lab crafting attempts.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 API Parameter Mismatch \u2013 The calls to get_entities failed due to incorrect argument usage. Ensure the function is invoked with parameters matching its expected signature (avoid unsupported keywords like \u201cradius\u201d and verify the number of positional arguments).\n\n\u2022 Lab Crafting and Placement Failures \u2013 Multiple errors occurred when attempting to supply or craft a Lab:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Validate that a Lab exists in the inventory before trying to place it.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 When retrieving labs from the map, check that the returned value is iterable (fallback to an empty list if None) to prevent type errors.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Confirm that all required sub-ingredients (for example, iron-gear-wheels derived from iron plates and components like copper-cables for electronic circuits) are sufficiently available before initiating lab crafting.\n\n\u2022 Resource Chain Shortages \u2013 Errors in lab production were compounded by missing components. Prioritize the production or smelting of crucial sub-ingredients (iron plates, copper plates, and processed copper cables) to facilitate successful lab crafting in future recovery updates."}
