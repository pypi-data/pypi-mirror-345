{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=10.5, y=34.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=10.5, y=34.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=0.5, y=28.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-3.5, y=27.5)\n- PipeGroup transporting water from the offshore pump to the boiler\n- PipeGroup transporting steam from the boiler to the steam engine\n- ElectricityGroup with poles connecting various positions to provide power\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=40.0, y=-84.0) with a drop position at (x=40.5, y=-82.5)\n- Wooden Chests at positions (x=40.5, y=-82.5) and (x=41.5, y=-83.5) storing coal\n- BeltGroup transporting coal with belts at positions (x=50.5, y=-86.5) to (x=48.5, y=-86.5) and (x=49.5, y=-86.5) to (x=47.5, y=-86.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Storage\nConsists of:\n- Iron Chests at positions (x=0.5, y=0.5), (x=1.5, y=0.5), and (x=2.5, y=0.5) storing iron plates and coal\n\n### Lab at Position (x=5.5, y=5.5)\nConsists of:\n- Lab connected to the power source at position (x=10.5, y=34.5) through ElectricityGroup\n\n### Miscellaneous\n- Burner Inserters at positions (x=54.5, y=-83.5) and (x=41.5, y=-80.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-15.0, y=-49.0)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Pipe Connections\n- Ensure all necessary pipe connections are established to form a complete pipe group. Missing connections can disrupt fluid transport.\n\n### Errors with Lab Power Connection\n- Verify that the lab is properly connected to a power source with sufficient voltage to ensure it receives power.\n\n### Errors with Mining Drill Fuel\n- Ensure that the mining drill has sufficient fuel to operate. Check the drill's fuel inventory regularly to prevent it from running out.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Ingredients\n- Ensure that the furnace has the necessary ingredients to smelt. Regularly check and supply the furnace with required materials to maintain production."}
