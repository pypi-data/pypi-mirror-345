{"content": "# FACTORIO REPORT\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System (around x=-5.0, y=2.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore pump at position x=-9.5, y=-0.5 (extracts water)\n- Boiler at position x=-5.0, y=2.5 (converts water to steam)\n- Steam engine at position x=-0.5, y=2.5 (generates electricity)\n- Burner inserter at position x=-6.5, y=2.5 (feeds coal to boiler)\n- Pipe system connecting water from offshore pump to boiler\n- Pipe system connecting steam from boiler to steam engine\n- Small electric pole at position x=-0.5, y=5.5 (distributes power)\n\n### Coal Mining System (around x=16.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position x=16.0, y=0.0 (mines coal)\n- Wooden chest at position x=17.5, y=-0.5 (collects coal)\n- Burner inserter at position x=17.5, y=0.5 (moves coal from chest to transport belt)\n- Transport belt system connecting coal to the boiler\n\n### Iron Mining and Smelting System (around x=15.5, y=70.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Electric mining drill at position x=15.5, y=70.5 (mines iron ore)\n- Stone furnace at position x=16.0, y=74.0 (smelts iron ore)\n- Burner inserter at position x=14.5, y=74.5 (intended to feed coal to furnace)\n- Small electric pole connecting power to the electric mining drill\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting entities with transport belts\n- When connecting entities with transport belts, ensure the start and end positions are within a reasonable distance and have a valid path between them\n- Transport belts cannot connect directly to entities like boilers - use an inserter as an intermediary\n- For long-distance connections (like from coal mine to iron furnace), use underground belts for efficiency\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Check for obstructions before placing entities - some entities cannot be placed on water or where other entities already exist\n- Ensure proper spacing when placing entities next to each other\n- When placing a steam engine, make sure it's properly aligned with the boiler's steam output\n\n### Errors when connecting fluid systems\n- Ensure fluid-carrying entities (boilers, steam engines) are properly connected with pipes\n- Check that the connection points between fluid entities are not blocked\n- Maintain proper orientation of fluid entities to ensure correct input/output connections\n\n### Errors with power distribution\n- When placing electric poles, ensure they don't overlap with other entities\n- Increase spacing or change direction when placing electric poles near other structures\n\n### Errors with fuel and resources\n- The stone furnace and some inserters are waiting for fuel or resources\n- Ensure complete supply chains are established before expanding to new production lines"}
