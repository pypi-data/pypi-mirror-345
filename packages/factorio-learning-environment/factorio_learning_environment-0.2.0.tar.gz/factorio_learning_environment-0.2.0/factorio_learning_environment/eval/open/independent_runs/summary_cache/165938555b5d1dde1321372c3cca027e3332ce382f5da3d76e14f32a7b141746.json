{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo new structures have been successfully constructed by the agent. Repeated recovery updates targeted a Lab Supply System at position (0.5, 2.5) intended to deliver Automation Science Packs for research, but all attempts to place or craft a Lab failed because the lab item was not available in inventory and the required sub-ingredients were missing. Although pre\u2010existing furnace structures (one at Position(x=5.0, y=5.0) used for additional iron plate smelting and another at Position(x=-27.0, y=-60.0) employed for copper plate production) were accessed for resource processing, no new structures were created\u2014the current scan still reports no entities on the map.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 API Parameter Errors for get_entities\n\u2003\u2013 When calling get_entities, do not pass unsupported keyword arguments (such as \u201cradius\u201d) or extra positional parameters. Verify the function signature to use the appropriate parameter style.\n  \n\u2022 Invalid Iteration on Returned Entities\n\u2003\u2013 Before iterating over results (for example, using a list comprehension on existing labs), ensure the returned value isn\u2019t None. Use a fallback (like an empty list) to prevent \u201cNoneType\u201d iteration errors.\n  \n\u2022 Lab Placement Failures\n\u2003\u2013 Confirm that the Lab item is available in the inventory before attempting placement at a target position. Also, check that the target tile is unobstructed to allow successful placement.\n  \n\u2022 Crafting Resource Shortages\n\u2003\u2013 Prior to initiating Lab crafting, prevalidate that all sub-ingredients (for example, iron-plates needed for iron-gear-wheels and copper-plates required for copper-cables/electronic-circuits) are available in sufficient quantities. Ensure that the complete production chain (including furnaces or crafting machines) is in place to supply these materials.\n  \n\u2022 General Resource and API Validation\n\u2003\u2013 Always double-check resource inventories and API usage patterns before executing critical placement or crafting commands to avoid cascading errors stemming from missing ingredients or incorrect function calls."}
