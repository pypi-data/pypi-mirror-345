{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 41.0, -82.0) with a drop position at (41.5, -80.5) and currently working, but has a warning that the chest at the drop position is full.\n\n### Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -80.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest (position 41.5, -80.5) with an inventory containing 321 units of coal.\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position -15.0, -50.0) with a fuel inventory full of coal (50 units) and a result inventory containing 100 units of iron plate. The furnace is currently not working due to no ingredients to smelt and being full.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n- **Errors when extracting items from a wooden chest**: \n  - Ensure that the wooden chest has enough items to extract before attempting to extract. The inventory was full of coal, but the extraction failed due to insufficient items in the chest.\n  \n- **Errors when picking up entities**: \n  - The inventory was full when trying to pick up the wooden chest. Clear some space in the inventory before attempting to pick up entities.\n\n- **Errors when inserting items into a furnace**: \n  - The furnace's inventory was full when trying to insert coal. Ensure that the furnace has space available before attempting to insert items.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- **Utility Functions Defined**:\n  - `extract_item(Prototype.Coal, wooden_chest, quantity=5)`: Failed due to insufficient items in the wooden chest.\n  - `pickup_entity(Prototype.WoodenChest, Position(41.5, -80.5))`: Failed due to full inventory.\n  - `insert_item(Prototype.Coal, furnace, quantity=5)`: Failed due to furnace inventory being full.\n  - `insert_item(Prototype.Coal, furnace, quantity=1)`: Failed due to furnace inventory being full.\n\n- **Important Variables Assigned**:\n  - `wooden_chest`: type `Entity`\n  - `coal`: type `int`\n  - `furnace`: type `Entity`\n  - `quantity`: type `int`"}
