{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Setup at position (-15.0, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and places it into a nearby chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-15.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates, but currently not receiving ore due to misalignment issues.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Alignment Errors\n- Ensure that the inserter's pickup position is correctly aligned with the chest's position. Misalignment causes the inserter to fail in transferring items.\n- Double-check the inserter's drop position to ensure it aligns with the intended target, such as a furnace.\n\n### Fuel Management Errors\n- Keep track of fuel levels in all entities that require it, such as the burner inserter and mining drill, to prevent them from stopping due to lack of fuel.\n\n### Inventory Management Errors\n- Ensure that there are sufficient resources in the inventory before attempting to insert them into entities. For example, ensure coal is available before trying to refuel an inserter.\n\n### Furnace Operation Errors\n- Verify that the furnace is receiving the necessary ingredients to operate. Check the inserter setup to ensure it is correctly transferring iron ore to the furnace."}
