Implement prerequisite resource verification\n    2. Add automatic smelting setup for required materials\n    3. Create crafting dependency tree\n\n### Entity Placement Conflicts\n- Repeated placement attempts on occupied tiles (-46.0,0.0) and (16.25,1.0)\n  - Solutions:\n    1. Implement pre-placement obstruction checks\n    2. Add automatic entity removal before replacement\n    3. Create collision detection system\n\n### Attribute Access Errors\n- Attempting to access non-existent 'drop_position' attribute\n  - Solutions:\n    1. Verify entity attributes before access\n    2. Implement proper entity type checking\n    3. Add defensive programming patterns\n\n### Fuel Management Issues\n- Multiple operations failing due to lack of coal\n  - Solutions:\n    1. Implement fuel monitoring system\n    2. Prioritize coal production before other operations\n    3. Add automatic fuel distribution\n\n### Construction Sequence Problems\n- Building furnaces before securing fuel supply\n  - Solutions:\n    1. Implement proper construction sequencing\n    2. Add resource availability checks\n    3. Create dependency-based building order\n\n### Existing Issues from Previous Report\n- Pipe connection problems\n- Entity placement range errors\n- Water edge placement failures\n- Inventory management issues\n- Power system validation\n- Construction process optimization\n- Position validation"}
