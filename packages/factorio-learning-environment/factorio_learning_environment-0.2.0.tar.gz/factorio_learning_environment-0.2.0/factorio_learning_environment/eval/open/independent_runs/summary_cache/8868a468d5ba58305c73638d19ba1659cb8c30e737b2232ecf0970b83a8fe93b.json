{"content": "# FACTORY REPORT\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System at position(-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of an offshore pump (position -9.5, -0.5), boiler (position -6.0, 1.5), and steam engine (position -1.5, 4.5) connected by pipes. The system is operational but the boiler needs regular coal refills.\n\n### Iron Mining and Smelting at position(18.5, 73.5)\nConsists of following entities:\n- Electric mining drill (position 18.5, 73.5) mining iron ore\n- Wooden chest (position 18.5, 75.5) collecting iron ore\n- Stone furnace (position 21.0, 76.0) smelting iron ore with coal\n- Output inserter (position 22.5, 76.5) moving iron plates\n- Output chest (position 23.5, 76.5) storing iron plates\n- Additional unused stone furnace (position 19.0, 77.0)\n\n### Copper Mining and Smelting at position(-48.5, 78.5)\nConsists of following entities:\n- Electric mining drill (position -48.5, 78.5) mining copper ore\n- Wooden chest (position -48.5, 80.5) collecting copper ore\n- Stone furnace (position -46.0, 81.0) smelting copper ore with coal\n- Output inserter (position -44.5, 81.5) moving copper plates\n- Output chest (position -43.5, 81.5) storing copper plates\n- Additional unused stone furnace (position -48.0, 82.0)\n- Inserter (position -47.5, 80.5) moving ore from chest to furnace\n\n### Copper Cable Production at position(3.5, 33.5)\nConsists of following entities:\n- Input chest for copper plates (position 3.5, 30.5)\n- Input inserter (position 3.5, 31.5) moving copper plates\n- Assembling machine (position 3.5, 33.5) crafting copper cables\n- Output inserter (position 5.5, 33.5) moving copper cables\n- Output chest (position 7.5, 33.5) storing copper cables\n\n### Electronic Circuit Production at position(17.5, 37.5)\nConsists of following entities:\n- Input chest for iron plates (position 17.5, 34.5)\n- Input inserter (position 17.5, 35.5) moving iron plates\n- Input inserter for copper cables (position 15.5, 37.5)\n- Assembling machine (position 17.5, 37.5) crafting electronic circuits\n- Output inserter (position 17.5, 39.5) moving electronic circuits\n- Output chest (position 17.5, 40.5) storing electronic circuits\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied spaces\n- Always check if a position is already occupied before placing an entity\n- When placing a chest at a drop position, first remove any inserters that might be occupying that space\n- When placing entities next to each other, ensure there's enough space and no collision with existing entities\n\n### Errors with inserter placement and orientation\n- Ensure inserters are correctly oriented to pick up from the source and drop at the destination\n- When an inserter is incorrectly oriented, remove it and place a new one with the correct orientation\n\n### Errors with power connections\n- Ensure all electrical entities are properly connected to the power grid\n- When connecting entities with power poles, make sure they are within range of each other\n- Check that steam engines are properly connected to the electrical network\n\n### Errors with resource insertion\n- Verify you have the required resources in your inventory before attempting to insert them into machines\n- When trying to insert ore into furnaces, make sure you've mined some first\n\n### Errors with entity placement spacing\n- When using functions like place_entity_next_to, adjust the spacing parameter if placement fails\n- Consider changing the direction parameter if the default placement direction causes collisions\n- Be aware of nearby entities that might block placement and adjust accordingly"}
