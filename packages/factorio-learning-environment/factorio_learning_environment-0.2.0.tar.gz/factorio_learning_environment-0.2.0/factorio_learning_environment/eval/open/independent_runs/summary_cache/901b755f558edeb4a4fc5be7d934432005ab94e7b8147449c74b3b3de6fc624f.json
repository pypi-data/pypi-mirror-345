{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at Position (-23.0, -68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) and a Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -70.0)\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) and a Stone Furnace at position (-21.0, -62.0)\n\n### Transport Belt Network\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Transport Belt at positions forming a network: \n  - (-24.5, -70.5) to (-23.5, -70.5) with direction RIGHT\n  - (-22.5, -70.5) with direction DOWN\n  - (-22.5, -69.5) to (-21.5, -69.5) with direction RIGHT\n  - (-21.5, -67.5) to (-21.5, -68.5) with direction UP\n  - (-17.5, -71.5) with direction RIGHT\n  - (-25.5, -68.5) to (-24.5, -69.5) with direction RIGHT\n  - (-20.5, -68.5) with direction UP\n  - (-25.5, -67.5) with direction RIGHT\n  - (-25.5, -65.5) with direction UP\n  - (-25.5, -66.5) to (-23.5, -66.5) with direction RIGHT\n  - (-24.5, -65.5) with direction UP\n  - (-23.5, -65.5) to (-21.5, -65.5) with direction RIGHT\n  - (-13.5, -62.5) with direction UP\n  - (-12.5, -55.5) with direction UP\n\n### Storage Area\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chests at positions: \n  - (52.5, -84.5), (54.5, -84.5), (-23.5, -69.5), (-17.5, -69.5), (-15.5, -69.5), (-24.5, -67.5), (-16.5, -64.5), (-14.5, -64.5), (-20.5, -63.5), (-13.5, -61.5), (-14.5, -54.5), (-12.5, -54.5), (1.5, 0.5), (3.5, 0.5)\n\n### Inserter Network\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Inserters at positions:\n  - (-16.5, -69.5), (-15.5, -64.5), (-13.5, -54.5), (2.5, 0.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the inserters are correctly positioned and have access to source items. Check the supply chain to ensure that items are being delivered to the inserters.\n\n### Errors with Furnaces Requiring More Copper Ore\n- Make sure that the supply of copper ore to the furnaces is consistent and sufficient. Consider increasing the number of mining drills or adjusting the transport belt network to ensure a steady supply.\n\n### Errors with Burner-Mining-Drill Waiting for Space in Destination\n- Ensure that there is enough space in the destination for the mined items. Consider adding more storage chests or adjusting the transport belt network to clear the backlog.\n\n### Errors with Belt Groups Being Empty\n- Verify that the transport belt network is correctly connected and that items are being transported efficiently. Check for any blockages or misalignments in the belt network."}
