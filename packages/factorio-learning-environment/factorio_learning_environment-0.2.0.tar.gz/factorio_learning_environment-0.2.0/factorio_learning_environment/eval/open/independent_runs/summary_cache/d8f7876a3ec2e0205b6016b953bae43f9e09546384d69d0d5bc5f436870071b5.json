{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-13.5, 22.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Boiler at position (-13.5, 20.0) (working)\n- Offshore pump at position (-11.5, 26.5) (working)\n- Pipe connections established between offshore pump and boiler\n- Steam engine at position (-14.5, 20.5) (not found)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities too far away\n- Ensure to move closer to the target position before attempting to place entities. The maximum distance for placing entities is 10 tiles.\n\n### Errors when placing entities due to existing objects\n- Check for existing objects in the target location before placing entities. If an object is in the way, choose a different position.\n\n### Errors when connecting entities\n- Verify that the connection points between entities (like pipes) are clear and that the entities are properly positioned to establish connections. Ensure that there are no obstructions preventing the connection.\n\n### Errors when checking inventory of non-existent entities\n- Ensure that the entity you are trying to check (like a wooden chest) exists at the specified position before attempting to access its inventory.\n\n### Errors when attempting to remove obstructions\n- Confirm that the obstruction can be removed and that the entity you are trying to manipulate has the correct attributes to allow removal.\n\n### Errors when adding items to entities\n- Ensure that the target entity can accept the items you are trying to add and that you are within range to perform the action. Verify that there is a nearby entity that can accept the items.\n\n### Errors related to non-existent entities\n- Ensure that the entities you are trying to interact with (like boiler or wooden chest) exist at the specified positions before performing actions on them.\n\n### Errors when repositioning entities\n- When attempting to reposition an entity, ensure that the new position is clear of obstructions. If there are existing objects in the way, find an alternative position.\n\n### Errors when attempting to connect pipes\n- Ensure that the pipe connections are not obstructed and that the entities are positioned correctly to allow for fluid transfer. Check that the connection points are valid and accessible.\n\n### Errors when trying to pick up non-existent entities\n- Ensure that the entity you are attempting to pick up exists at the specified position before trying to perform the action.\n\n### Errors when accessing entity attributes\n- Ensure that the entity you are trying to access has the correct attributes and that you are referencing the right entity type. Check for typos or incorrect references in your code.\n\n### Errors when attempting to get a non-existent steam engine\n- Ensure that the steam engine exists at the specified position before trying to access its status. If it has been removed or not placed, update your actions accordingly.\n\n### Errors when placing steam engine\n- Ensure that the target position for the steam engine is clear of obstructions before attempting to place it. If something is in the way, find an alternative position.\n\n### Errors when finding a valid position to place lab\n- Check the surrounding area for obstructions before attempting to place the lab. Ensure that there is enough space available for the lab to be placed."}
