{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nThis structure is responsible for mining iron ore and smelting it into iron plates. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-16.0, -51.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (1 unit)\n  - Energy: 2666.67\n  - Status: Working\n  - Warnings: Output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Drop Position: (-16.5, -52.5)\n  - Resources: 40,000 units of iron ore\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-14.0, -49.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (14 units)\n  - Energy: 1600.0\n  - Status: No Ingredients\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Furnace Result: 60 iron plates\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied or incorrect positions\n- **Wooden Chest Placement**: Ensure the drop position of the drill is clear before placing a wooden chest. Attempting to place a wooden chest at an occupied position will fail.\n- **Transport Belt Placement**: Verify that the desired location for placing a transport belt is unoccupied and suitable for placement.\n- **Burner Inserter Placement**: Confirm that the desired location for placing a burner inserter is valid and unoccupied.\n\n### Errors when moving entities to invalid positions\n- **Stone Furnace Movement**: Ensure that the target position for moving a stone furnace is valid and that an entity of the correct type exists at the specified location.\n\n### Errors due to missing entities\n- **Entity Retrieval**: When using the `get_entity` function, ensure that the entity type and position are correct to avoid exceptions related to missing entities.\n\n### General Tips\n- Regularly clear items from the drill's drop position to prevent blockage and ensure continuous operation.\n- Check for warnings on entities, such as \"output blocked\" or \"no ingredients to smelt,\" and address these issues promptly to maintain efficient production."}
