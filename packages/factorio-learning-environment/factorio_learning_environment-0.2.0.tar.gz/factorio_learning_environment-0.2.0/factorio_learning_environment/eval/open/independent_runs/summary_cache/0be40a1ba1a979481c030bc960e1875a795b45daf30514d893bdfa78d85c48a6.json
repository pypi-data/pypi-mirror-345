{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Coal Mining Setup at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (41.0, -82.0)\n- Wooden chest at position (41.5, -80.5) for storing coal\n\n#### Inserter Setup at Position (-16.5, -44.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner inserter at position (-16.5, -44.5)\n- Burner inserter at position (-15.5, -44.5)\n- Burner inserter at position (-13.5, -44.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when placing entities on non-buildable tiles\n- Ensure the target tile is clear and buildable before placing entities like wooden chests, transport belts, and inserters. Repeated attempts to place entities at non-buildable positions (e.g., x=-17.5 y=-44.5) resulted in errors.\n\n#### Errors when placing entities in occupied positions\n- Verify that the target position is not already occupied by another entity before attempting to place a new one. This applies to wooden chests, transport belts, and inserters.\n\n#### Errors when placing entities without sufficient space\n- Ensure there is enough space around the target position for the entity to be placed correctly. For example, inserters and transport belts require specific spacing to function properly.\n\n#### Errors when placing entities in incorrect orientations\n- Double-check the direction and orientation of entities like inserters to ensure they are placed correctly and can interact with adjacent entities as intended.\n\n#### Errors when extracting or inserting items\n- Ensure the target entity (e.g., chest or mining drill) is accessible and has the necessary items before attempting to extract or insert resources. For example, inserting coal into a mining drill requires the drill to be within reach and have space for the fuel."}
