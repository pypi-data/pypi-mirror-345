{"content": "It seems that the attempt to remove the existing furnace using `pickup_entity` was unsuccessful. This could be due to the furnace being in a state that doesn't allow it to be picked up directly. Let's try a different approach by using a more forceful method to remove the furnace and then place a new one.\n\n# Step 1: Forcefully remove the existing furnace\n\n# Move to the furnace location\nmove_to(entity_position)\n\n# Use a more direct approach to remove the furnace\nentities_at_location = get_entities(position=entity_position)\n\n# Attempt to remove the furnace by directly interacting with it\nfor entity in entities_at_location:\n    if entity.name == \"stone-furnace\":\n        destroy_entity(entity)\n        print(\"Existing furnace destroyed for reset.\")\n\n# Step 2: Place a new stone furnace at the specified position\n\n# Place the new furnace\nnew_furnace = place_entity(Prototype.StoneFurnace, Direction.UP, Position(x=0, y=0))\n\n# Validate successful placement\nassert new_furnace, \"Failed to place a new furnace at the specified position.\"\n\n# Step 3: Insert coal into the new furnace\n\ntry:\n    coal_inserted = insert_item(Prototype.Coal, new_furnace, quantity=1)\n    assert coal_inserted, \"Failed to insert coal into the new furnace.\"\n    print(\"Coal successfully inserted into the newly placed furnace.\")\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"Encountered an issue inserting coal after reinstallation: {e}\")\n\n# Allow time for processing\nsleep(10)\n\n# Verify the new furnace's inventory status\nfurnace_inventory_post_insertion = inspect_inventory(new_furnace)\nprint(\"New furnace status after coal insertion: \", furnace_inventory_post_insertion)\n\n# Print out the current inventory and entities to ensure all is as expected\nprint(f\"Final Check on Player Inventory: {inspect_inventory()}\")\nprint(f\"Current Entity Overview: {get_entities()}\")", "summary_range": "[1-96]"}
