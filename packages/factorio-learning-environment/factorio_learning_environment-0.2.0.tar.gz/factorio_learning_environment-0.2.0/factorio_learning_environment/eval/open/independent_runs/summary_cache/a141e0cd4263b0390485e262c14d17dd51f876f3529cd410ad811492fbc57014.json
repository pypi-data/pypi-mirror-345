{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) extracting iron ore and transferring it to a chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5) storing iron ore extracted by the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5) transferring iron ore from the chest to a furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0) intended for smelting iron ore into iron plates, but currently not receiving iron ore.\n\n### Coal Refueling Setup\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-1.5, 0.5) intended to refuel the stone furnace with coal.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Misalignment of Inserters\n- Ensure that inserters are correctly aligned with their pickup and drop positions. Misalignment can prevent them from transferring items effectively.\n\n### Inserter Setup Errors\n- Regularly check the setup of inserters to ensure they are configured correctly to transfer items between entities. Misconfiguration can lead to entities not receiving the necessary resources.\n\n### Refueling Errors\n- Ensure that there is sufficient fuel in the inventory before attempting to refuel machines. Lack of fuel can halt operations.\n\n### Inventory Management\n- Maintain an adequate supply of necessary resources like coal to prevent interruptions in machine operations."}
