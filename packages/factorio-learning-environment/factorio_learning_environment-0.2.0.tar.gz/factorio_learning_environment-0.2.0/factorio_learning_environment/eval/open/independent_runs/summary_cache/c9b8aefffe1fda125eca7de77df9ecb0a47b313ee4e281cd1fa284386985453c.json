{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Extraction Area at position(41.5, -80.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position(41.0, -82.0) which is extracting coal and has a drop position at (41.5, -80.5).\n- Wooden chest at position(41.5, -80.5) which is currently full with 800 units of coal.\n- Wooden chest at position(42.5, -80.5) which is also full with 799 units of coal.\n\n### Stone Furnace at position(-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace at position(-15.0, -50.0) which is currently not smelting due to lack of ingredients and has a result inventory containing 100 iron plates.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n- **Errors when extracting items from a chest that is full**\n  - Ensure that the chest at the drop position (41.5, -80.5) is emptied before attempting to extract items from it. The current inventory indicates that it is full.\n  \n- **Errors when using extracting but being too far**\n  - Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n- **Repeated extraction errors**\n  - The same extraction command has been attempted multiple times without success. Review the extraction logic and check the status of the target entity before executing the command.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- **Utility Functions Defined:**\n  - `extract_item(Prototype.Coal, Position(41.5, -80.5), quantity=5)` \n    - **Failure Mode:** Could not extract due to the chest being full.\n    - **Success Mode:** Not applicable as the function has not succeeded in the current execution steps.\n\n- **Important Variables Assigned:**\n  - `extracted_coal`: type `int` (attempted to extract 5 units of coal)\n  - `current_inventory`: type `dict` (contains {'wood': 4, 'coal': 3450, 'iron-ore': 50, 'iron-plate': 821})"}
