Overlapping burner\u2011inserters and misaligned transport belts around Position(8.0, 20.5) and near (8.5, 22.5) prevent formation of a clear buildable space.  \n   \u2013 Mitigation Strategies:  \n      \u2022 Reevaluate the boiler zone and clear or reposition conflicting entities.  \n      \u2022 Redesign adjacent connection interfaces to free up sufficient placement space.  \n      \u2022 Consider relocating the extra steam engine to a less congested area to overcome the spatial bottleneck."}
