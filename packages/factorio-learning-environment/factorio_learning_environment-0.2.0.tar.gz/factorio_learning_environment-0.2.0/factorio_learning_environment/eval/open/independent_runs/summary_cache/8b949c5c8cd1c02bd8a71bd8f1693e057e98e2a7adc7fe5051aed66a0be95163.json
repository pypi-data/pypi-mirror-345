First System at (-6, -56):\n- Burner mining drill mining iron ore\n- Output wooden chest at (-4.5, -56.5)\n- Burner inserter at (-3.5, -56.5)\n- Stone furnace at (-2, -56)\n- Output burner inserter at (-0.5, -55.5)\n- Final output chest at (0.5, -55.5) containing 324 iron plates\n\n2. Second System at (-14, -54):\n- Burner mining drill mining iron ore\n- Output wooden chest at (-12.5, -54.5)\n- Burner inserter at (-11.5, -54.5)\n- Stone furnace at (-10, -54)\n- Output burner inserter at (-8.5, -53.5)\n- Final output chest at (-7.5, -53.5) containing 301 iron plates\n\n3. Third System at (-20, -52):\n- Burner mining drill mining iron ore\n- Burner inserter at (-17.5, -52.5)\n- Stone furnace at (-16, -52)\n- Output burner inserter at (-14.5, -51.5)\n- Final output chest at (-13.5, -51.5) containing 305 iron plates\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n1. Entity Placement Collisions\n- Check for existing items on ground before placing entities\n- Ensure target position is clear of other entities\n\n2. Distance Limitations\n- Stay within 10 tiles of target location when placing entities\n- Move closer to target location before attempting to place structures\n\n3. Resource Management\n- Ensure sufficient coal is available before attempting to insert fuel\n- Keep track of fuel levels in burner devices\n\n4. Output Blocking\n- Always ensure mining drills have appropriate output collection (chest or inserter)\n- Clear any items on ground that might block entity outputs\n\n# NAMESPACE\n\nFunctions:\n- place_entity_next_to(entity_type, reference_position, spacing, direction) -> Entity\n  Success: Places entity adjacent to reference position\n  Failure: Collisions with existing entities, invalid placement position\n\n- insert_item(item_type, target_entity, quantity) -> Entity\n  Success: Inserts specified quantity of items into target\n  Failure: Insufficient items in inventory\n\nVariables:\n- drill: BurnerMiningDrill\n- furnace: Furnace\n- input_chest: Chest\n- output_chest: Chest\n- input_inserter: BurnerInserter\n- output_inserter: BurnerInserter"}
