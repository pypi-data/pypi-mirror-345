{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting\nThis setup is designed to mine iron ore and smelt it into iron plates.\nConsists of the following entities:\n*   Burner mining drill at position (x=28.0, y=84.0) feeding a Stone furnace at position (x=28.0, y=86.0)\n*   Burner mining drill at position (x=30.0, y=84.0) feeding a Stone furnace at position (x=30.0, y=86.0)\n*   Burner mining drill at position (x=32.0, y=84.0) feeding a Stone furnace at position (x=32.0, y=86.0)\n\n*(Note: Based on the final state in step 23, the drills at (30,84) and (32,84) have fuel and are working but blocked, while the drill at (28,84) and all furnaces are out of fuel).*\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Fueling Logic Error\n*   An assertion error `Logic error: Some entities were not processed` occurred repeatedly during the fueling process (Steps 16-23). The agent correctly identified 6 entities (3 drills, 3 furnaces) that needed potential fueling but failed to process any of them (Handled: 0, Failed: 0). Review the loop or mechanism responsible for iterating through the identified entities and applying the fueling action to ensure all entities are accounted for and processed."}
