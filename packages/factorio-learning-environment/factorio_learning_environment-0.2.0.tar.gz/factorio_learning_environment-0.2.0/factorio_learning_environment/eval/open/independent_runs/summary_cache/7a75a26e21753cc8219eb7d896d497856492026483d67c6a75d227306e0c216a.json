{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report (Steps 40-47)\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Functional Power Plant at (-9.5, 0.5)\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, 0.5) facing right (working, water output)\n- Boiler at (-7.0, 1.5) facing right (14 coal, producing steam)\n- Steam engine at (-2.5, 1.5) facing right (working, power output 14.7kW)\n- Small electric pole at (-2.5, 3.5) (connected to power network)\n- Connected pipe network for water and steam transport\n\n### Smelting and Production Complex\n- Iron smelting furnace at (5.0, 0.0) (50 coal, no iron ore, status: NO_INGREDIENTS)\n- Copper smelting furnace at (5.0, 4.0) (49 coal, no copper ore, status: NO_INGREDIENTS)\n- Gear assembler at (8.5, 0.5) (powered, missing iron plates)\n- Cable assembler at (8.5, 4.5) (powered, 2 copper cables in output, missing copper plates)\n- Science assembler at (12.5, 2.5) (powered, missing both copper plates and gear wheels)\n- Inserters at (6.5, 0.5), (6.5, 4.5), and (10.5, 0.5) (all powered but waiting for items)\n\n### Power Distribution Network\n- Multiple small electric poles forming complete power network\n- All production buildings properly connected to grid\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Persistent Placement Issues\n- Repeated failed attempts to place wooden chest at (13.5, 2.5)\n  - Clear existing entity blocking this position before placement\n  - Verify exact position isn't occupied by assembler output or other entity\n\n### Furnace Management Problems\n- Multiple attempts to insert coal into full furnace inventory (50/50)\n  - Clear furnace output before adding more fuel\n  - Monitor furnace inventory levels before insertion attempts\n- Iron furnace stuck with no ore despite available inventory\n  - Ensure ore is being properly inserted into furnace input side\n\n### Production Chain Breakdowns\n- Gear assembler starved of iron plates\n  - Verify iron furnace is producing and plates are being transported\n  - Clear any blockages in plate transport path\n- Science assembler missing both copper plates and gear wheels\n  - Fix upstream production issues before addressing science pack production\n  - Add buffer chests between production stages\n\n### General Improvements\n- Implement inventory monitoring before insertion attempts\n- Add transport belts between furnaces and assemblers\n- Clear all assembler outputs to prevent backups\n- Balance fuel distribution between furnaces and boiler\n- Add circuit conditions to prevent overfilling inventories"}
