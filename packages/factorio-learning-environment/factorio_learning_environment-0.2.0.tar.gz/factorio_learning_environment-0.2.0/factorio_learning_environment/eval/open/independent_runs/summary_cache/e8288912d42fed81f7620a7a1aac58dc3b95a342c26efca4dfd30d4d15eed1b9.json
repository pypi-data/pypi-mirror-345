{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=5.5, y=21.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=5.5, y=21.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=-1.5, y=24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\n- Pipe connections between the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with a warning of \"no ingredients to smelt\"\n\n### Lab at Position (x=2.5, y=0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Lab with status \"working\" and research \"automation\" in progress\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of:\n- Small Electric Poles connecting various entities, including the steam engine and lab, forming an electricity group with id 199\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Insufficient Resources\n- Ensure you have enough materials before attempting to craft items. For example, ensure you have enough copper plates and wood before crafting copper cables and small electric poles.\n\n### Errors When Using Undefined Variables\n- Double-check variable names for typos or undefined variables. For instance, ensure 'copper_cable_needed_for_poles' is defined before use.\n\n### Errors When Connecting Entities\n- Verify that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to connect entities like pipes or electric poles. Ensure all necessary connections are in place to maintain functionality.\n\n### Errors When Extracting or Inserting Items\n- Ensure the target entity exists and contains the expected items before attempting to extract or insert items. For example, confirm the presence of copper plates in the furnace before extraction.\n\n### Errors When Checking or Setting Lab Status\n- Make sure the lab entity is correctly identified and exists at the specified position before performing operations related to research or status checks.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Fuel\n- Regularly check and maintain sufficient coal inventory to refuel boilers and keep the steam engine operational.\n\n### Assertion Errors for Entity Status\n- Validate that entities like steam engines are in the correct working status after setup. If not, troubleshoot connections and resource supply to resolve the issue."}
