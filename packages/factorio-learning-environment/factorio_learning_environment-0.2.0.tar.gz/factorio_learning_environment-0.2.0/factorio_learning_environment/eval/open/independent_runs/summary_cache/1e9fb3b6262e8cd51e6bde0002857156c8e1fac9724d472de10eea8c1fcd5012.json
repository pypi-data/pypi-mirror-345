{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(52.5, 51.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam engine (position 52.5, 51.5) which is currently not connected to a power network and has no input liquid.\n\n### Offshore pump at position(-9.5, 24.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump (position -9.5, 24.5) which is currently working and connected to a pipe system.\n\n### Furnace at position(1.0, 1.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace (position 1.0, 1.0) which has coal as fuel but no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Lab at position(6.5, 1.5)\nConsists of:\n- Lab (position 6.5, 1.5) which is currently not powered and is set for research on automation.\n\n### Burner inserter at position(8.5, 1.5)\nConsists of:\n- Burner inserter (position 8.5, 1.5) which is currently out of fuel.\n\n### Chests at positions(3.5, 1.5), (3.5, 3.5), and (3.5, 5.5)\nConsists of:\n- Wooden chest (position 3.5, 1.5) containing iron plates.\n- Wooden chest (position 3.5, 3.5) containing iron plates.\n- Wooden chest (position 3.5, 5.5) which is currently empty.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting steam engine to electric pole\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to connect entities. Check your inventory for small electric poles.\n\n### Errors when inspecting inventory of steam engine\n- The steam engine's inventory cannot be inspected if the entity is stale or not properly initialized. Ensure the steam engine is correctly placed and connected to the power network.\n\n### Errors when using undefined variables\n- Avoid using variables that have not been defined in your code. Ensure that all necessary variables are properly initialized before use.\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure that the position you are trying to place an entity is not occupied by another entity. Check the surrounding area before placing new structures."}
