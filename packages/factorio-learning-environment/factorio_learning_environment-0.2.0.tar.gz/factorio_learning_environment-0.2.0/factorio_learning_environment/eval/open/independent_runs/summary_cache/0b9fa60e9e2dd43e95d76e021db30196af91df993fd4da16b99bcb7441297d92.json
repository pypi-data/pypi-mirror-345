{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Stone brick production at position (-45.0, 3.0)\nConsists of following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at (-46.0, 0.0) mining stone\n- Stone furnace at (-45.0, 3.0) smelting stone bricks\n- Burner inserter at (-46.5, 3.5) moving stone from belts to furnace\n- Burner inserter at (-43.5, 3.5) moving bricks from furnace to chest\n- Wooden chest at (-41.5, 3.5) storing bricks\n- Belt group connecting drill to furnace input inserter:\n  - Underground belt at (-46.5, 2.5) direction UP\n  - Transport belt at (-46.5, 1.5) direction UP\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Belt connection errors\n- Transport belts cannot connect directly to furnaces - always use inserters as intermediaries\n- When connecting belts, ensure:\n  - The path is clear of obstructions\n  - The belt directions create a valid flow path\n  - Underground belts are placed in matching pairs\n\n#### Placement collision errors\n- Always check for existing entities before placing new ones\n- Remove blocking entities before attempting to place new ones in occupied positions\n- Underground belts require 2 clear tiles in their direction of placement\n\n#### Distance limitations for placement\n- Move within 10 tiles of target position before attempting to place entities\n- The player must be close enough to interact with entities (max distance = 10 tiles)\n\n#### Production chain issues\n- Ensure all components of a production chain are properly connected:\n  - Mining drills need output paths (belts/inserters)\n  - Furnaces need both input and output inserters\n  - Verify inserter directions match the required flow\n\n#### Entity status monitoring\n- Check entity status messages to identify issues:\n  - \"output blocked\" warnings indicate missing output connections\n  - \"no ingredients\" status means input problems\n  - \"waiting for source items\" suggests upstream supply issues\n\n#### Assertion errors\n- Verify production actually occurs before asserting outputs exist\n- Monitor furnace contents and inserter activity before checking for products"}
