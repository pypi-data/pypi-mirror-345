Use an inserter as the intermediary to accept items.\n\n\u2022 Placement Range Error\n \u2013 Confirm that the target location is within the allowed placement distance. If a placement fails due to excessive distance, move closer before attempting to place an entity.\n\n\u2022 Inventory and Variable Reference Errors\n \u2013 Verify that the required entity (for example, a wooden chest) is available in inventory before placement.\n \u2013 Ensure that all referenced variables (such as the target chest) are correctly defined to avoid NameError issues."}
