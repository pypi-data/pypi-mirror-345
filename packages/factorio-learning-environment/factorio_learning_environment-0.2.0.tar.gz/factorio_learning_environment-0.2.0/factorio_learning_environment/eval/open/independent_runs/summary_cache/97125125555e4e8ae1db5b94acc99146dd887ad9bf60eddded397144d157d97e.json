{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll update the report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production at (-18.0, -53.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-18.0, -53.0) with drop position (-17.5, -51.5)\n- Stone furnace at (-17.0, -51.0) containing 4 coal and 20 iron plates\nCurrently inactive due to lack of fuel in mining drill\n\n### Copper Plate Production at (-21.0, -73.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-21.0, -73.0) with drop position (-20.5, -71.5)\n- Stone furnace at (-20.0, -71.0) containing 2 coal and 14 copper plates\nCurrently inactive due to lack of fuel in mining drill\n\n### Smelting Area near Origin\nGroup of furnaces each containing 23 coal:\n- Stone furnace at (0.0, 0.0)\n- Stone furnace at (2.0, 0.0)\n- Stone furnace at (2.0, 4.0)\n- Stone furnace at (4.0, 4.0)\nAll furnaces have fuel but no ingredients to smelt\n\n### Research Facility\n- Lab containing 10 automation science packs\nCurrently not functioning due to lack of power\n\n### Power Generation System (Latest Configuration)\nCurrent setup consists of:\n- Steam engine at (-14.5, 15.5) facing DOWN\n- Boiler at (-14.5, 19.0) containing 12 coal\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Multiple pipe groups connecting components\nSystem partially functioning:\n- Water system connected and flowing\n- Steam being generated\n- Steam engine not connected to power network\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Conflicts\n- Check target location for existing entities before placement\n- Ensure sufficient clear space around placement area\n- Remove blocking entities before attempting new placements\n\n### Steam Engine Placement\n- Ensure proper orientation (UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT) based on connection requirements\n- Clear area completely before placing steam engine\n- Verify connection points alignment with boiler\n\n### Power Network Setup\n- Place electric poles at valid locations without obstructions\n- Ensure proper spacing between poles to maintain network connectivity\n- Connect steam engine to power network before adding consumers\n\n### Resource Management\n- Verify coal availability before attempting to fuel entities\n- Maintain adequate coal supply for continuous operation\n- Check inventory contents before attempting resource insertions\n\n### Fluid System Construction\n- Remove all existing pipe groups before new connections\n- Create direct, minimal connections between components\n- Verify fluid flow after completing connections\n- Keep pipe paths short and direct\n- Handle water and steam connections separately\n\n### Entity Removal\n- Verify entity exists at target location before attempting removal\n- Remove all pipes before attempting new fluid connections\n- Clear area completely when rebuilding systems\n\n### Power System Construction\n- Build system in correct sequence: offshore pump \u2192 boiler \u2192 steam engine \u2192 power poles\n- Verify each component is working before adding the next\n- Ensure proper spacing and orientation between components\n- Connect power network only after fluid systems are operational"}
