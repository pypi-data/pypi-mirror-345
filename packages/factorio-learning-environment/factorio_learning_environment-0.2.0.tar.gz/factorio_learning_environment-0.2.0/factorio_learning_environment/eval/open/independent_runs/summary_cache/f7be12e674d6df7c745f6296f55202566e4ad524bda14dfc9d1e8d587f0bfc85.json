{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing Facility at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) extracting coal.\n- Stone Furnace at position (43.0, -82.0) processing coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -80.5) storing coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (43.5, -80.5) transferring items from the chest to the furnace.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0) processing iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) storing iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-14.5, -46.5) transferring items from the chest to the furnace.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities due to collisions or unsuitable terrain\n- Ensure there is enough space and no obstructions at the target position before placing an entity. Consider increasing spacing, changing direction, or selecting a different reference position to avoid collisions with existing entities or unsuitable terrain like water.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient inventory items\n- Ensure that you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. Regularly check and manage your inventory to avoid running out of essential resources like coal."}
