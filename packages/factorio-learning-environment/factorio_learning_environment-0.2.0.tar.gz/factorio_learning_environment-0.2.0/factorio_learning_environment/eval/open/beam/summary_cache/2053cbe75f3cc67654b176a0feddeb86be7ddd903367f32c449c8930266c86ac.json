{"content": "I notice that our mining drill has the status \"NO_MINABLE_RESOURCES\" - we need to place it on an iron ore patch! Let's modify our approach:\n\n1. First find iron ore\n2. Place the drill on the iron ore\n3. Then set up the furnace next to it\n\nHere's the improved code:\n\n```python\n# First find stone and collect it (we need this for the furnace)\nstone_pos = nearest(Resource.Stone)\nprint(f\"Found stone at {stone_pos}\")\nmove_to(stone_pos)\nharvest_resource(stone_pos, quantity=10)\nprint(f\"After harvesting stone: {inspect_inventory()}\")\n\n# Craft the furnace\ncraft_item(Prototype.StoneFurnace, quantity=1)\nprint(f\"After crafting furnace: {inspect_inventory()}\")\n\n# Find iron ore patch\niron_pos = nearest(Resource.IronOre)\nprint(f\"Found iron ore at {iron_pos}\")\nmove_to(iron_pos)\n\n# Place mining drill on iron ore\ndrill = place_entity(\n    Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill,\n    position=iron_pos,\n    direction=Direction.RIGHT\n)\nprint(f\"Placed drill at {drill.position}\")\n\n# Add fuel to drill\ninsert_item(Prototype.Coal, drill, quantity=5)\nprint(\"Added fuel to drill\")\n\n# Place furnace next to drill's output\nfurnace = place_entity(\n    Prototype.StoneFurnace,\n    position=Position(x=drill.drop_position.x + 1, y=drill.drop_position.y)\n)\nprint(f\"Placed furnace at {furnace.position}\")\n\n# Add fuel to furnace\ninsert_item(Prototype.Coal, furnace, quantity=5)\nprint(\"Added fuel to furnace\")\n\n# Wait for iron plates\nprint(\"Waiting for iron plates to smelt...\")\nsleep(10)\n\n# Check furnace inventory\nprint(f\"Furnace inventory: {inspect_inventory(furnace)}\")\nprint(f\"Drill status: {drill.status}\")\n```\n\nThis should:\n1. Get stone and craft furnace\n2. Find iron ore patch\n3. Place drill ON the iron ore\n4. Place furnace next to drill output\n5. Add fuel to both\n6. Let it run\n\nThe key insight is that the drill needs to be placed directly on minable resources to work!", "summary_range": "[1-3482]"}
