{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo structures have been successfully placed on the map. All attempts to place entities have resulted in errors, and the map remains empty of structures.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Position Object\n- Ensure that when using position-related functions or objects, the indices are integers. Avoid using strings where integers are expected to prevent errors like \"string indices must be integers, not 'str'\".\n\n### Errors with Non-callable Position Object\n- Verify that the Position object is being used correctly. Avoid treating Position objects as callable functions to prevent errors such as \"'Position' object is not callable\".\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities\n- Before placing any entity, ensure that the target tile is unoccupied and suitable for the entity type. This will help avoid errors like \"Cannot place [Entity] at x=[x] y=[y].\"\n\n### Errors with BuildingBox Size\n- When using a BuildingBox to place entities, ensure the size is appropriate for the available space. If no viable place is found, consider decreasing the BuildingBox size or using multiple smaller BuildingBoxes to fit the map constraints."}
