{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone Furnace at position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace (position 0.0, 0.0) with a status of NO_INGREDIENTS and a furnace result of 95 iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest (position 2.5, 0.5) containing 100 iron plates.\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position(-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position -15.0, -50.0) with a status of WORKING, currently has 10000 iron ore resources, and a warning indicating that the chest at the drop position (-14.5, -48.5) is full.\n- Wooden Chest (position -14.5, -48.5) containing 487 iron ore.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n- **Errors when trying to smelt without ingredients**: Ensure that the Stone Furnace has the necessary ingredients to smelt. Currently, it has no ingredients to smelt.\n- **Warnings about full chest**: The Burner Mining Drill is unable to continue mining due to the chest at the drop position being full. Empty the chest at (-14.5, -48.5) to allow the drill to continue working.\n- **Repeated actions without changes**: The agent has repeatedly fed iron ore into the Stone Furnace and refueled the Burner Mining Drill without any change in status. Consider checking the status of these entities before repeating actions.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- **Utility Functions**: None defined yet.\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `iron_ore`: int\n  - `iron_plate`: int\n  - `coal`: int\n  - `wood`: int\n  - `burner_mining_drill_position`: tuple(float, float)\n  - `stone_furnace_position`: tuple(float, float)"}
