{"content": "It appears that the search for an operational **Burner Inserter** has not yielded any results, even though the game state indicates that there are **Burner Inserters** present on the map. This suggests that the criteria for identifying an operational **Burner Inserter** may be too restrictive or that the entities are not in a state that allows them to be interacted with.\n\n### Steps to Diagnose and Resolve the Issue\n\n1. **List All Burner Inserters**: Instead of filtering for operational status, let's list all **Burner Inserters** to confirm their presence and status.\n\n2. **Check for Any Available Burner Inserters**: If there are any **Burner Inserters**, we can then decide how to interact with them.\n\n3. **Insert Coal into Any Found Burner Inserter**: If we find any **Burner Inserters**, we can attempt to insert coal into one of them regardless of their current status.\n\n### Implementation\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Retrieve all Burner Inserters on the map\nburner_inserters = get_entities({Prototype.BurnerInserter})\n\n# Step 2: Print out the details of all Burner Inserters found\nif burner_inserters:\n    print(\"Found Burner Inserters:\")\n    for inserter in burner_inserters:\n        print(f\"Name: {inserter.name}, Position: {inserter.position}, Status: {inserter.status}, Fuel: {inserter.fuel}\")\n\n    # Step 3: Attempt to insert coal into the first found Burner Inserter\n    first_burner_inserter = burner_inserters[0]\n    if current_inventory.get(Prototype.Coal, 0) >= 5:\n        insert_item(Prototype.Coal, first_burner_inserter, 5)  # Insert coal into the first found Burner Inserter\n        print(\"Inserted 5 coal into the first Burner Inserter.\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Not enough coal in inventory to insert into the Burner Inserter.\")\n    \n    # Step 4: Check the status of the first Burner Inserter after the insertion\n    burner_inserter_status = first_burner_inserter.status\n    print(\"Status of the first Burner Inserter after refueling:\", burner_inserter_status)\nelse:\n    print(\"No Burner Inserters found on the map.\")\n```\n\n### Expected Outcome\nBy executing this code, I should be able to confirm the presence of **Burner Inserters** on the map and their respective statuses. This will help clarify why the previous attempts to interact with them were unsuccessful. If any **Burner Inserters** are found, I will attempt to insert coal into one of them, regardless of its operational status.", "summary_range": "[1-2016]"}
