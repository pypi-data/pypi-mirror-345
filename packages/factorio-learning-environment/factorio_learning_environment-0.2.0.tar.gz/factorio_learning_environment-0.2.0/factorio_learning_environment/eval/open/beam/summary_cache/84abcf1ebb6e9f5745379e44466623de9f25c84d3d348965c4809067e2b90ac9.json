{"content": "The error you're encountering is due to the use of `Entity` in the type hint, which is not defined in the current context. Let's correct this by removing the type hint for `reference_pole` or replacing it with a more appropriate type if known. Here's the corrected function without the type hint for `reference_pole`:\n\n```python\ndef ensure_power_connection(machine_position: Position, reference_pole=None):\n    try:\n        # Place an electric pole at close proximity; check existing proximity poles first\n        pole_position = Position(machine_position.x - 1, machine_position.y)\n        \n        if not reference_pole:\n            reference_pole = place_entity(Prototype.SmallElectricPole, pole_position)\n        \n        # Establish connection\n        connected_entities = connect_entities(reference_pole, assembling_machine)\n        if connected_entities:\n            print(f\"Assembling machine at {assembling_machine.position} is now connected to power.\")\n        \n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Failed to adequately power the assembling machine: {e}\")\n\n# Call the function to ensure power\nensure_power_connection(assembling_machine.position)\n```\n\n### Key Adjustments:\n- Removed the type hint for `reference_pole` to avoid the `NameError`.\n- Ensure that the `place_entity` and `connect_entities` functions are correctly used to place and connect the electric pole.\n\n### Additional Steps:\n- Verify that the electric pole is correctly placed within the power range of the assembling machine.\n- Check if the assembling machine's power status updates after executing the function.\n\nThis should help resolve the issue and ensure that the assembling machine is connected to power. If the problem persists, ensure that the electric network is correctly set up and that there are no other underlying issues with power distribution.", "summary_range": "[1-104]"}
