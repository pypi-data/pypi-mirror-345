{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=5.5, y=21.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=5.5, y=21.5), currently working with steam output.\n- Boiler at position (x=-1.5, y=24.0), currently working and fueled by coal.\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5), currently working and supplying water.\n- PipeGroup connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine, ensuring water and steam flow.\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0), fueled and producing copper plates.\n\n### Research Lab at Position (x=2.5, y=0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab with automation science packs, connected to the electricity network.\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Small Electric Poles at various positions, connecting the steam engine to the lab and other entities.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Inventory Management\n- Ensure that the required items are available in the inventory before attempting to insert them into entities like furnaces or boilers. For example, ensure copper ore is available before inserting it into a furnace.\n\n### Errors When Using Undefined Variables\n- Double-check variable names and ensure they are defined before use. For instance, ensure `copper_cable_needed_for_poles` is defined before using it in calculations.\n\n### Errors When Refueling\n- Regularly check inventory levels to ensure enough coal is available for refueling boilers. Plan mining activities accordingly to maintain a steady supply.\n\n### Errors in Entity Connections\n- Verify the connections between entities such as pipes and ensure they are correctly aligned and connected. For example, ensure pipes are correctly connected from the offshore pump to the boiler.\n\n### Errors in Entity Status Checks\n- Ensure that entities like steam engines are correctly connected and operational before asserting their status. Double-check connections and inputs to avoid assertion errors.\n\n### Errors in Entity Identification\n- Ensure that entities like labs are correctly identified and available at specified positions before performing operations on them."}
