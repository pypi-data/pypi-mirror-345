{"content": "# Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Complex at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) with fuel (coal: 9), extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-15.5, -48.5) and (-14.5, -48.5) for storing extracted materials.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5) for transferring materials.\n- **Stone Furnaces**:\n  - Furnace 1 at position (-12.0, -48.0) with fuel (coal: 12), smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n  - Furnace 2 at position (-10.0, -48.0) with fuel (coal: 11), currently inactive due to no ingredients.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage and Distribution\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Wooden Chests**:\n  - Positioned at (-6.5, -49.5), (-6.5, -48.5), (-7.5, -48.5), (-5.5, -48.5), (-4.5, -48.5), and (-3.5, -48.5) for storing iron plates.\n  - Chest at position (-14.5, -46.5) storing iron ore and iron plates.\n\n### Inserter Network\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Inserters**:\n  - Positioned at (-14.5, -47.5), (-11.5, -46.5), (-8.5, -47.5), and (-11.5, -45.5) for moving items between chests and furnaces.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Extracting Items from Furnaces\n- Ensure that the furnace contains the items you intend to extract. Check the furnace's inventory before attempting extraction.\n- Verify the quantity specified for extraction is available in the furnace.\n\n### Inserter Drop Position Blockage\n- Regularly check and clear the drop positions of inserters to prevent blockages. Ensure there is space for items to be placed.\n\n### Errors when Using Extracting but Being Too Far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when Placing into a Tile Occupied by Another Entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placement."}
