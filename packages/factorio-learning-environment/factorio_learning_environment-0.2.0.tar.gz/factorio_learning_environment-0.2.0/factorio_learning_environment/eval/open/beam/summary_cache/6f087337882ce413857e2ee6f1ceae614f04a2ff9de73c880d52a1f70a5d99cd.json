{"content": "I see the issue now. We can't craft chests directly because:\n1. Wooden chests need wood which must be gathered from trees\n2. Iron chests need more iron plates and require a crafting machine\n3. We only have 1 iron plate which isn't enough\n\nLet's try a different approach - let's find existing chests in the game world:\n\n```python\n# Check what we have in our inventory\ninventory = inspect_inventory()\nprint(f\"Current inventory: {inventory}\")\n\n# Find any existing chests in the game world\nexisting_chests = get_entities({Prototype.WoodenChest, Prototype.IronChest, Prototype.SteelChest})\nprint(f\"Found {len(existing_chests)} existing chests\")\n\nif existing_chests:\n    # Get the closest chest\n    chest = existing_chests[0]\n    print(f\"Found chest at: {chest.position}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No existing chests found\")\n\n# Get the mining drill reference\ndrill = get_entities({Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill})[0]\nprint(f\"Found drill at: {drill.position}\")\n\n# Add fuel if needed\nif drill.status == EntityStatus.NO_FUEL:\n    insert_item(Prototype.Coal, drill, quantity=5)\n    print(\"Added fuel to drill\")\n\n# Verify drill status\nprint(f\"Mining drill status: {drill.status}\")\n```\n\nThis will help us understand what resources we have available in the game world before deciding our next action. Would you like me to execute this code?", "summary_range": "[1-2752]"}
