{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (22.5, -7.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (22.5, -7.5)\n- Boiler at Position (20.5, -4.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (4.5, -10.5)\n- Small Electric Poles at Positions (22.5, -4.5), (24.5, -7.5), and (24.5, -6.5)\n- Pipe Network connecting the steam engine, boiler, and offshore pump\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-11.0, 20.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at Position (-11.5, 18.5)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0) and (2.0, 0.0)\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (5.0, 5.0)\n\n### Copper Cable Factory\nConsists of:\n- Assembling Machine at Position (10.5, 0.5)\n- Inserters at Positions (7.5, 5.5) and (9.5, 5.5)\n- Belt Group connecting the furnace at Position (5.0, 5.0) to the assembling machine at Position (10.5, 0.5)\n\n### Storage and Transport System\nConsists of:\n- Wooden Chests at Positions (-3.5, 0.5), (-3.5, 2.5), (8.5, 5.5), and (-11.5, 18.5)\n- Transport Belts at Positions (10.5, 5.5), (9.5, 6.5), and (8.5, 6.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Missing Ingredients\n- Ensure that there are sufficient resources in the inventory to supply to the assembling machines and furnaces. For instance, the assembling machine at Position (10.5, 0.5) is experiencing a shortage of copper plates.\n\n### Errors when Asserting Entity Status\n- Before asserting the status of an entity, verify that all necessary conditions are met. The assertion error in step 25 indicates that the assembling machine still has an ingredient shortage.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source items are available for inserters to function. Inserters at Positions (7.5, 5.5) and (9.5, 5.5) are waiting for source items.\n\n### Furnace Lacking Ingredients\n- Make sure that furnaces have the required ingredients to operate. Furnaces at Positions (0.0, 0.0), (2.0, 0.0), and (5.0, 5.0) are lacking ingredients to smelt."}
