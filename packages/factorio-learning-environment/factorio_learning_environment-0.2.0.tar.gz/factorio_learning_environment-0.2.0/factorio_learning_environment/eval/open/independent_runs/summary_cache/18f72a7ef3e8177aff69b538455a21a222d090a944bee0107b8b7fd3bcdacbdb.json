{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Electricity generator at position(-4.5, 25.0)\nConsists of steam engine (position not placed), boiler (position not placed) and offshore pump (position not placed). The boiler is intended to provide steam for the steam engine, which generates electricity.\n\n#### Pipe group at position(-10.5, 21.5)\nConsists of multiple pipes forming a fluid system. This structure is used to transport fluids between different entities.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when attempting to pick up entities\n- Ensure the entity you are trying to pick up exists at the specified position before attempting to pick it up. In this case, the boiler was not found at the given coordinates.\n\n### Errors when placing steam engines\n- Ensure the target location for placing the steam engine is clear of other entities. If there are existing objects in the way, the placement will fail.\n- Avoid placing steam engines in locations that overlap with water, as this will prevent placement.\n\n### Errors when checking entity inventories\n- Verify that the entity you are trying to check exists at the specified position before attempting to access its inventory. In this instance, the wooden chest was not found.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into entities\n- Ensure that the entity you are trying to insert items into is nearby and can accept the items. In this case, the boiler could not accept coal because it was not found at the specified position."}
