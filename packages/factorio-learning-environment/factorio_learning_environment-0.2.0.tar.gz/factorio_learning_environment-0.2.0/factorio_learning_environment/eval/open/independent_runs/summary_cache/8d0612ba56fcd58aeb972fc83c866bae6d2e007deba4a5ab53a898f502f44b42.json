{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-16.0, -51.0) with direction UP, fueled by coal, and currently working. It has a warning indicating that the output is blocked by an item on the ground, and there is no sink entity to accept the output.\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-14.0, -49.0) with direction UP, fueled by coal, but currently has no ingredients to smelt. It is connected to the Burner Mining Drill.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied locations\n- Ensure that the desired location for placing an entity is not already occupied by another entity. This applies to Wooden Chests, Burner Inserters, Stone Furnaces, and Transport Belts.\n\n### Errors when moving entities to occupied locations\n- Before attempting to move an entity such as a Stone Furnace, verify that the target location is unoccupied.\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities from specific positions\n- When using functions like `get_entity`, ensure that the entity type and position are correct and that an entity of the specified type exists at that position.\n\n### Errors related to blocked outputs\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity or appropriate space to accept outputs from entities like Burner Mining Drills to prevent blockage warnings.\n\n### Errors when placing Transport Belts\n- Verify that the intended path for Transport Belts is clear and not obstructed by other entities or terrain features."}
