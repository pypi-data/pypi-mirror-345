{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-34.5, 30.0)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump (position -34.5, 30.0)\n- Boiler (position -34.5, 30.0)\n\n### Pipes\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Pipe (position -11.5, 21.5)\n- Pipe (position -3.5, 25.5)\n- Pipe (position -10.5, 24.5) - Note: This pipe is currently causing issues due to an existing entity at the target position.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(x)\nConsists of following entities\n- Burner mining drill (position x1) and a furnace at position(y1)\n- Burner mining drill (position x2) and a furnace at position(y2)\n- Burner mining drill (position x3) and a furnace at position(y3)\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of following entities\n- Burner mining drill (position x1) and a furnace at position(y1)\n- Assembling machine at position(z1) and inserter at position(a) that puts into assembling machine\n- Beltgroup (position ) that connects the furnace at position y1 to assembling machine at position(z1)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when attempting to place or connect pipes\n- Ensure that there are no existing entities at the target positions before attempting to place new pipes. Remove any obstructing entities first.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
