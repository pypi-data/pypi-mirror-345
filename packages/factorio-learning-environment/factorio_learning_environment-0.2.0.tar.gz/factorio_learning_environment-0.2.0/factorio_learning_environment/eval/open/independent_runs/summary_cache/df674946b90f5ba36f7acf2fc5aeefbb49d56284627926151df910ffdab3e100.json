{"content": "## Report\n\n### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (x=6.0, y=-62.0)\n- Consists of:\n  - Stone Furnace at Position (x=6.0, y=-62.0) with a fuel inventory of coal and producing iron plates.\n  - Inserter at Position (x=6.5, y=-60.5) connected to the electric network, although currently not receiving electricity.\n  - Wooden Chest at Position (x=6.5, y=-59.5) storing iron plates and copper plates.\n\n#### Electricity Generator at Position (x=-5.5, y=24.0)\n- Consists of:\n  - Boiler at Position (x=-5.5, y=24.0) fueled by coal and working with a fluid system.\n  - Steam Engine at Position (x=-1.5, y=24.5) generating electricity.\n  - Offshore Pump at Position (x=-9.5, y=24.5) supplying water to the system.\n  - Pipe Group connecting the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine.\n\n#### Research Lab\n- Lab with input for automation science packs but currently no research in progress.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when Starting Research\n- Ensure that the lab has the necessary science packs and that a research topic is selected before starting research.\n\n#### Errors when Using get_entity for Small Electric Poles\n- Verify the position and existence of entities before attempting to retrieve them using get_entity. Ensure that the specified position is accurate and that the entity exists at that position.\n\n#### Errors with Inserter Not Receiving Electricity\n- Check the connections and ensure that the inserter is properly connected to an active electric network. Verify that the electricity generator is functioning and supplying power to the network."}
