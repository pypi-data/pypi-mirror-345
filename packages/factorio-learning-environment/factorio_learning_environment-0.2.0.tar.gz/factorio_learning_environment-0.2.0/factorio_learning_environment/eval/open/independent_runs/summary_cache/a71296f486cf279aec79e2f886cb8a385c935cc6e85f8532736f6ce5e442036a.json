{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (10.5, 34.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (10.5, 34.5)\n- Boiler at position (0.5, 28.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-3.5, 27.5)\n- PipeGroup for water transport from offshore pump to boiler, positions: (x=-3.5,y=26.5), (x=-2.5,y=26.5), (x=-1.5,y=26.5), (x=-1.5,y=27.5), (x=-1.5,y=28.5)\n- PipeGroup for steam transport from boiler to steam engine, positions: (x=1.5,y=26.5), (x=0.5,y=26.5), (x=3.5,y=26.5), ..., (x=10.5,y=29.5), (x=10.5,y=31.5), (x=10.5,y=30.5)\n\n### Power Network\n- ElectricityGroup connecting lab at position (5.5, 5.5) to power source at position (10.5, 34.5) with poles at various positions including (x=16.5,y=31.5), (x=12.5,y=34.5), (x=9.5,y=23.5), ..., (x=13.5,y=27.5), (x=7.5,y=17.5), (x=7.5,y=13.5)\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing Unit\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (40.0, -84.0) with a drop position at (40.5, -82.5)\n- Wooden Chests at positions (40.5, -82.5) and (41.5, -83.5)\n- Burner Inserters at positions (54.5, -83.5) and (41.5, -80.5)\n- BeltGroup with belts at positions (50.5, -86.5) to (48.5, -86.5), (49.5, -86.5) to (47.5, -86.5), (43.5, -84.5) to (45.5, -84.5), (45.5, -85.5) to (47.5, -85.5), and (52.5, -83.5) to (52.5, -85.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Storage\n- Iron Chests at positions (0.5, 0.5), (1.5, 0.5), and (2.5, 0.5) containing coal and iron plates\n\n### Lab\n- Lab at position (5.5, 5.5) with input for automation science packs, currently without power\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Power Network Connections\n- Ensure that all poles in the electricity network are properly connected and that there is a continuous path from the power source to all consumers. Check for any missing or misplaced poles.\n\n### Errors in Pipe Network Connections\n- Verify that all pipes are correctly connected to ensure fluid flow. Check for any missing or incorrectly placed pipes.\n\n### Errors in Electricity Group Detection\n- Confirm that all components of the electricity group are correctly placed and connected. Ensure that the electricity group is recognized by the system.\n\n### Errors in Resource Extraction\n- Ensure that chests at drop positions are not full to allow continuous mining. Regularly check and empty chests to prevent overflow and stoppage of mining operations."}
