{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-47.5, -123.5)\n- Steam Engine at position (-59.5, -111.5)\n- Small Electric Poles at positions (-61.5, -110.5), (-61.5, -111.5), (-57.5, -110.5), and (-57.5, -111.5)\n- Pipe Groups connecting various positions for fluid transport\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -76.0) with a Wooden Chest at position (-15.5, -77.5)\n- Stone Furnaces at positions (-19.0, -73.0), (9.0, -64.0), and (6.0, -62.0)\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (6.5, -59.5)\n- Small Electric Poles providing power connections\n\n### Pipe Network\nConsists of multiple Pipe Groups for fluid transport, including positions such as:\n- (-52.5, -122.5), (-35.5, -122.5), (-50.5, -120.5), (-51.5, -119.5), (-44.5, -116.5), (-45.5, -115.5), (-40.5, -114.5), (-48.5, -111.5), (-37.5, -111.5), (-43.5, -109.5), (-1.5, 11.5), (-0.5, 17.5), (-12.5, 23.5), (-4.5, 24.5), (1.5, 24.5), (2.5, 25.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors When Placing Entities on Occupied Tiles\n- Ensure that the target tile is clear of any existing objects before attempting to place a new entity. This can be done by checking the tile's status or visually confirming its availability.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Power\n- Make sure all electrical entities are connected to a power network. This involves ensuring that small electric poles are properly placed and connected to the power grid.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Fuel\n- Regularly check and refuel entities like Burner Mining Drills to ensure continuous operation. Keep a stock of fuel resources and automate refueling if possible.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Ingredients\n- Ensure that all furnaces and assemblers have the necessary ingredients to process. Automate the supply chain to maintain a steady flow of required materials.\n\n### Errors Due to Full Inventory\n- Regularly clear out or expand storage solutions like chests to prevent overflow and halt in production. Consider using inserters and belts to automate the transfer of items to storage.\n\nBy addressing these errors, the agent can improve efficiency and reduce downtime in production processes."}
