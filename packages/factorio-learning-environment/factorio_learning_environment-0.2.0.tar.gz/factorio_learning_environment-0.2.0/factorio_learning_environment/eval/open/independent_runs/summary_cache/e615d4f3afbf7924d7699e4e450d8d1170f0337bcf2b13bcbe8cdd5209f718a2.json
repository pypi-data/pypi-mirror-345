Instead, the agent has interacted with two pre\u2010existing furnace systems used for ore processing:\n\n### Iron Smelting Furnace at Position(5.0, 5.0)\nConsists of a furnace used to convert iron ore into iron plates (10 iron ore and 10 coal inserted with 30 iron plates extracted).\n\n### Copper Smelting Furnace at Position(-27.0, -60.0)\nConsists of a furnace employed for smelting copper ore into copper plates (50 copper ore and 10 coal inserted with 45 copper plates extracted).\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 When using the entity\u2010retrieval API (get_entities), ensure the arguments match the expected signature. Avoid supplying unsupported keywords (such as \u201cradius\u201d) or an incorrect number of positional arguments.\n\n\u2022 Lab placement and crafting failures stem from unavailable lab inventory and missing sub\u2010ingredients. Before attempting lab placement, verify that the lab item is in inventory. Prior to crafting a lab, confirm that all necessary components (for example, iron-plate, iron-gear-wheel, copper-plate, copper-cable, and electronic-circuit) are available or producible via functioning smelting and production chains.\n\n\u2022 When iterating over retrieved entities (e.g. filtering labs), guard against the possibility that the retrieval function returns None. Use a fallback (such as an empty list) to prevent TypeErrors from attempting to iterate a NoneType."}
