{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=1.5, y=23.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Steam Engine** at position (x=17.5, y=20.5) with energy 15000.0, connected to:\n  - Pipe at position (x=17.5, y=17.5)\n  - Pipe-to-ground at position (x=16.5, y=17.5)\n- **Boiler** at position (x=1.5, y=23.0) with energy 2000.0, fuelled with coal, connected to:\n  - Pipe at position (x=-0.5, y=21.5)\n  - Pipe at position (x=1.5, y=21.5)\n  - Pipe at position (x=0.5, y=21.5)\n  - Pipe at position (x=2.5, y=21.5)\n  - Pipe at position (x=3.5, y=21.5)\n  - Pipe at position (x=-0.5, y=23.5)\n- **Offshore Pump** at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5), connected to:\n  - Pipe at position (x=-9.5, y=23.5)\n  - Pipe at position (x=-8.5, y=23.5)\n- **PipeGroup** for steam, starting at position (x=3.5, y=17.5) and ending at (x=10.5, y=21.5)\n- **PipeGroup** for water, starting at position (x=-9.5, y=23.5) and ending at (x=-0.5, y=23.5)\n\n### Electricity Network\n- **ElectricityGroup** with poles at positions such as (x=27.5, y=26.5), (x=10.5, y=13.5), (x=7.5, y=8.5), etc., providing power distribution across the map.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Connecting Boiler to Steam Engine\n- Ensure that all required pipes are correctly positioned and connected between the boiler and steam engine. Verify that the pipe network is complete and continuous.\n\n### Errors When Refueling Boiler\n- Always check your inventory for available resources before attempting to refuel. Ensure you have sufficient coal in your inventory before refueling the boiler.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Defined Utility Functions\n- `insert_item(item: Prototype, target: Entity, quantity: int) -> None`: This function attempts to insert a specified quantity of an item into a target entity. Ensure that the item exists in the inventory before calling this function.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `boiler`: Represents the boiler entity on the map, used in refueling operations.\n- `inventory`: A dictionary containing the current inventory of items such as 'wooden-chest', 'burner-inserter', 'small-electric-pole', etc.\n\nThis report provides a comprehensive overview of the existing structures and potential errors encountered during the execution steps. It also outlines the utility functions and variables used by the agent."}
