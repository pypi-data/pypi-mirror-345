{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll generate a comprehensive report:\n\n# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Smelting System (Around position 46,-81)\nComplex smelting setup consisting of:\n- Two stone furnaces at (45.0, -81.0) and (47.0, -81.0)\n- Input chest at (46.5, -78.5) containing iron ore\n- Input inserter at (46.5, -79.5) moving items from input chest to furnaces\n- Output chests at (45.5, -83.5) and (47.5, -83.5)\n- Additional storage chest at (49.5, -80.5) containing iron plates\n\n### Coal Mining Operation (Around position 41,-82)\nMining setup consisting of:\n- Burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0) mining coal\n- Multiple storage chests:\n  - Two iron chests at (41.5, -84.5) and (41.5, -83.5) storing coal\n  - Output wooden chest at (41.5, -80.5)\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Conflicts\n- Always check if target location is clear before placing new entities\n- Remove existing entities if you need to place something in their position\n- Verify there's enough space for the entity's full footprint\n\n### Terrain Placement Issues\n- Ensure placement location is on valid terrain (not water)\n- Check if the target position allows for the specific entity type\n\n### Entity Rotation Issues\n- Some entities cannot be rotated - verify entity supports rotation before attempting\n- Plan initial placement orientation carefully to minimize need for rotation\n\n### System Capacity Issues\n- Monitor chest capacities to prevent overflow\n- Empty full chests to maintain system operation\n- Implement better output handling when storage is full\n\n# NAMESPACE\n\n### Important Variables\n- `first_furnace`: Furnace - Stone furnace at (45.0, -81.0)\n- `second_furnace`: Furnace - Stone furnace at (47.0, -81.0)\n- `first_output_inserter`: BurnerInserter\n- `second_output_inserter`: BurnerInserter\n\n### System States\n- Furnace fuel levels: ~40-50 coal each\n- Input chest: Contains 50 iron ore\n- Output storage: One furnace has 8 plates, other has 100 plates\n- Coal storage: Multiple chests at capacity (800-1600 coal each)"}
