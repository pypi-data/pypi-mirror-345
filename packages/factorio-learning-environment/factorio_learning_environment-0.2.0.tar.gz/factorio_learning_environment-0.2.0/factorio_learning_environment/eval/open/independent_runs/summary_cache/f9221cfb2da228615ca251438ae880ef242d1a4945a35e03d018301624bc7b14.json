{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nThis structure is responsible for mining iron ore and processing it into iron plates. It consists of:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0), which extracts iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-14.5, -48.5) and (-15.5, -48.5) for storing extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5) that transfers iron ore from the chests to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-14.5, -47.5) for transferring items between entities.\n- **Additional Wooden Chests** at positions (-14.5, -46.5) for storing processed iron ore.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage Facility\nThis facility stores the iron plates produced from the smelting process. It consists of:\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-7.5, -48.5), (-6.5, -48.5), and (-5.5, -48.5), which store iron plates.\n\n### Secondary Processing and Storage Facility\nThis facility handles additional processing and storage of iron plates. It consists of:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-10.0, -48.0) for potential additional smelting.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-8.5, -47.5) for item transfer.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-7.5, -47.5) and (-6.5, -47.5) for storing processed items.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placement. If a tile is occupied, remove the existing entity before placing a new one.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the inserters have access to the source items they need to transfer. Check if the source entities contain items and are within the inserter's reach.\n\n### No Ingredients to Smelt in Furnace\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to process. Verify that the inserters are correctly transferring the required materials into the furnaces.\n\n### Consider Planning for Future Expansion\n- Utilize accumulated resources such as iron plates for expanding production facilities. Plan for additional structures to increase efficiency and output."}
