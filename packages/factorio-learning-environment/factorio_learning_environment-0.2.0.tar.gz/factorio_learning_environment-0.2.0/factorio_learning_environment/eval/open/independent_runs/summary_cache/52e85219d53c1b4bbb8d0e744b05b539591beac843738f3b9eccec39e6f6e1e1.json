{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nA smelting line for converting iron ore to iron plates consisting of:\n\nInput Side:\n- 4 wooden chests at positions (0.5, -2.5), (2.5, -2.5), (4.5, -2.5), and (6.5, -2.5) containing iron ore and coal\n- 4 burner inserters at positions (0.5, -1.5), (2.5, -1.5), (4.5, -1.5), and (6.5, -1.5) moving materials from input chests to furnaces\n\nProcessing:\n- 4 stone furnaces at positions (0.0, 0.0), (2.0, 0.0), (4.0, 0.0), and (6.0, 0.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates\n\nOutput Side:\n- 3 wooden chests at positions (2.5, 1.5), (4.5, 1.5), and (6.5, 1.5) for collecting produced iron plates\n- 1 burner inserter at position (0.5, 1.5) for output handling\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Conflicts\n- When placing inserters, check if the target position is already occupied by another entity (like wooden chests)\n- Use proper spacing parameters when placing entities next to existing structures\n\n### Output System Issues\n- Ensure output inserters have proper destination entities (chests) before placing them\n- Output inserters without proper destination entities will get blocked by items on the ground\n- Consider placing all output infrastructure (chests) before placing corresponding inserters\n\n### Alignment Issues\n- Make sure inserters are properly aligned with their source and destination entities\n- When fixing misaligned inserters, remove them first before placing new correctly aligned ones\n- Double check the direction parameter when placing inserters to ensure proper orientation"}
