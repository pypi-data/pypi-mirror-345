{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (4.0, -60.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (4.0, -60.0) with 3 units of coal as fuel. The furnace is operational with iron ore being smelted.\n\n### Coal Mining Operation at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) with a drop position at (40.5, -83.5). The drill is operational with coal as fuel.\n- Wooden Chest at position (40.5, -83.5) collecting coal from the drill.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Missing Inventory Items\n- Ensure that all required items are available in the inventory before attempting to place entities. For example, the placement of a burner mining drill failed due to the absence of the drill in the inventory.\n\n### Errors When Extracting Items from Non-Existent or Empty Entities\n- Verify the presence and contents of entities before attempting to extract items. Multiple attempts to extract iron plates from the stone furnace failed because the furnace did not contain the specified items.\n\n### Errors When Crafting Without Required Resources\n- Gather all necessary resources before crafting items. An attempt to craft a stone furnace failed due to the absence of stone, which is a raw resource that must be gathered.\n\n### Errors When Placing Entities Adjacent to Non-Existent References\n- Ensure that the reference entity exists and is correctly specified when placing entities next to other entities. An attempt to place a wooden chest next to a burner mining drill failed due to an incorrect reference to the drill's drop position.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Fuel\n- Regularly check and replenish fuel for entities like burner mining drills to ensure continuous operation. The burner mining drill is currently out of fuel and not operational.\n\n### Errors When Placing Entities Without Required Inventory\n- Ensure that the required entities are available in the inventory before attempting placement. The placement of a wooden chest failed due to the absence of the chest in the inventory.\n\n### Errors When Crafting Items with Sub-Ingredient Issues\n- Ensure that all sub-ingredients are available and can be crafted or gathered before attempting to craft complex items. An attempt to craft a burner mining drill failed because the required iron plates could not be crafted without a crafting machine or smelting in a furnace.\n\n### Errors When Placing Entities on Occupied Tiles\n- Ensure that the target tile is free before placing an entity. An attempt to place a burner mining drill failed because the target position was already occupied by another entity."}
