They work together to feed raw materials into the furnaces and collect smelted outputs, forming the core of early metallurgy.\n\n\u2022 Iron Ore Mining Automation Setup  \n  A burner\u2011mining drill located at (\u201315.0, \u201350.0) is coupled with a nearby wooden chest and a network of transport belts. This setup is dedicated to extracting and routing iron\u2011ore for base expansion.\n\n\u2022 Steam Power Generation System  \n  The power network centers on a boiler positioned at (8.0, 20.5) that supplies steam to a series of steam engines (referred to as \u201cGenerator\u201d entities) scattered throughout the base (e.g. at positions such as (0.5, 9.5), (18.5, 11.5), (1.5, 13.5), etc.). An additional steam engine intended to expand the network remains unplaceable. Repeated diagnostics indicate that the designated placement area is heavily congested by overlapping and misaligned burner\u2011inserters, transport belts, and other entities\u2014especially in and around the boiler\u2019s connection interfaces and the buildable zone near (approximately 8.5, 22.5).\n\n\u2022 Automation Research Lab  \n  A laboratory organized for processing automation science packs is present. However, it continues to exhibit power connectivity issues (reflected by its \u201cNO_POWER\u201d status and changing electrical identifier) that prevent proper operation.\n\n\u2022 Electrical and Transport Infrastructure  \n  An interconnected infrastructure including electricity groups, belt groups, and pipe groups spans the base. While many components are functioning normally (or are in an \u201cEMPTY\u201d status waiting for materials), their spatial congestion contributes to placement challenges in areas like the boiler vicinity.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 Persistent Extra Steam Engine Placement Issue  \n  \u2013 The extra steam engine consistently remains unplaceable because the designated construction zone is heavily congested by overlapping burner\u2011inserters, misaligned transport belts, and other interfering entities.  \n  \u2013 To mitigate: perform a detailed manual inspection of the boiler area and its connection interfaces; remove or reposition obstructive objects; consider relocating the extra steam engine to a less congested zone or adjust the boiler layout to free up necessary space.\n\n\u2022 Fuel and Source Supply Inconsistencies in Burner Entities  \n  \u2013 Multiple burner\u2011inserters and the burner\u2011mining drill report \u201cNO_FUEL\u201d or \u201cWAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS\u201d warnings.  \n  \u2013 Ensure that fuel sources are reliably supplied and that entities are correctly adjacent to their fuel and resource providers to avoid operational stalls.\n\n\u2022 Steam Engine Connectivity and Fluid Routing Warnings  \n  \u2013 Several steam engines generate warnings such as \u201cnot connected to power network,\u201d \u201cno input liquid,\u201d and \u201cno fluid present in connections.\u201d  \n  \u2013 Review and correct pipe alignments and connection points; confirm that both the fluid routing from the boiler and the integration with the power grid are properly established to allow for full operation.\n\n\u2022 Laboratory Power Deficiency  \n  \u2013 The Automation Research Lab continues to exhibit a \u201cNO_POWER\u201d status, indicating uncertain integration with the active electrical network.  \n  \u2013 Reassess the lab\u2019s electrical connections and ensure consistent power delivery, possibly by reconfiguring nearby poles or wiring setups.\n\n"}
