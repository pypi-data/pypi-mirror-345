{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Smelting Line at (0,0) to (6,4)\nConsists of four stone furnaces for smelting iron plates:\n- Furnace 1 at (0,0)\n- Furnace 2 at (2,0) \n- Furnace 3 at (4,4)\n- Furnace 4 at (6,4)\n\n### Copper Smelting Line at (0,4) to (2,4)\nConsists of two stone furnaces for smelting copper plates:\n- Copper Furnace 1 at (0,4)\n- Copper Furnace 2 at (2,4)\n\n### Research Station at (8.5,0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Lab building loaded with automation science packs\n- Currently researching automation technology but lacks power\n\n### Partial Power Generation System at (-9.5,23.0)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5,24.5) connected to water\n- Boiler at (-9.5,23.0) connected to the pump\n- Steam engine not yet successfully placed\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inventory Related Errors\n- Always check if required items are in inventory before attempting to place or insert items\n- Common examples: tried placing stone furnace, lab, and offshore pump without having them in inventory\n- Ensure sufficient raw materials are in inventory before attempting crafting operations\n\n### Entity Placement Errors\n- Check terrain compatibility before placing entities (especially for steam engines near water)\n- Ensure target location is clear of other entities before placement\n- For water-based structures, verify correct positioning relative to water tiles\n\n### Crafting System Errors\n- Complex items like labs require all sub-components to be available\n- When crafting items requiring machine assembly (like copper plates for circuits), ensure proper production facilities are set up first\n- Plan the crafting sequence to have all prerequisite items ready\n\n### Programming/API Errors\n- When working with building dimensions, ensure proper access to entity properties\n- Incorrect usage: Trying to add integers to ModelPrivateAttr\n- Use proper API methods to access entity dimensions\n\n### Connection Errors\n- Power generation system components need proper connections\n- Ensure correct positioning and orientation of connected entities like boilers, pumps, and steam engines\n- Pay attention to fluid connection points when placing power generation components"}
