{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-16.0, -51.0) with coal fuel, currently working but output blocked by item on the ground. It has a drop position at (-16.5, -52.5).\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) with coal fuel, currently has no ingredients to smelt. The furnace result inventory contains iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied or invalid locations\n- Ensure that the desired location for placing entities such as Transport Belts, Wooden Chests, and Burner Inserters is not occupied by another entity or invalid. Verify the placement area before attempting to place an entity.\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities at specific positions\n- Confirm the existence of entities like Stone Furnaces at the specified positions before attempting to retrieve them. This can be done by checking the map for entity presence at the desired coordinates.\n\n### Errors when moving entities to new locations\n- Verify the target location is valid and unoccupied before attempting to move entities like Stone Furnaces. This will prevent errors related to moving entities to invalid positions.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into entities\n- Ensure that the required items, such as coal, are available in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities like drills. This will prevent errors related to missing inventory items.\n\n### Errors related to blocked outputs\n- Address warnings about blocked outputs by ensuring that there is a sink entity in place to accept the output from entities like Burner Mining Drills. This will prevent production halts due to output blockage."}
