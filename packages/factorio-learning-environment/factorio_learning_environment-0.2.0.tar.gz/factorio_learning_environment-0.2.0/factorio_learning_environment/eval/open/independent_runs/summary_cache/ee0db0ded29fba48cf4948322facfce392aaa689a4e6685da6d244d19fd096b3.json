{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\nConsists of:\n- Boiler at position (-5.5, 24.0)\n- Steam Engine at position (-1.5, 24.5)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-10.5, 25.5)\n- Pipe network connecting these entities, including pipes at positions such as (-10.5, 24.5), (-9.5, 24.5), and (-7.5, 24.5)\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -73.0) with coal as fuel\n- Stone Furnace at position (9.0, -64.0) with coal as fuel\n- Stone Furnace at position (6.0, -62.0) with coal as fuel\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) transferring items from the furnace to a wooden chest at position (7.5, -61.5)\n- Small Electric Poles at positions such as (5.5, -60.5) and (7.5, -60.5) for electricity distribution\n\n### Pipe Network\n- PipeGroup (fluid_system=7035) at position (-1.5, 11.5) with multiple pipes, status EMPTY\n- PipeGroup (fluid_system=7051) at position (-10.5, 24.5) with water, status FULL_OUTPUT\n- PipeGroup (fluid_system=7053) at position (-4.5, 26.5), status EMPTY\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Pipe Connection\n- Ensure that all pipes are properly aligned and connected before attempting to reconnect. Verify the positions and ensure there are no obstructions or incorrect placements.\n\n### Steam Engine Power Generation\n- Verify that the steam engine is connected to a functioning power network and has a sufficient supply of steam. Ensure that the boiler is fueled and operational.\n\n### Inserter Power Issues\n- Check that inserters are connected to a powered electric pole. Ensure that the electric network is complete and that there are no gaps in the connection.\n\n### Furnace Ingredient Supply\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Regularly check and restock the furnace source inventories to maintain production.\n\n### Electric Network Connection\n- Verify that all electric poles are properly connected to form a complete circuit. Ensure that the electricity groups have a voltage greater than zero for effective power distribution."}
