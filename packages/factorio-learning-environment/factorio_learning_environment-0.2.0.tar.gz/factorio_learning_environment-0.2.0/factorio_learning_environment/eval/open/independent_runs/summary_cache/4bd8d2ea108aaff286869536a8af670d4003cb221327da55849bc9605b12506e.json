{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone mine and smelter at position(-46, 0)\nConsists of \n- Burner mining drill (position(-46.0, 0.0))\n- Wooden chest (position(-45.5, 1.5)) to collect mined stone\n- Stone furnace (position(-44.0, 2.0)) to smelt stone bricks\n- Burner inserter (position(-42.5, 1.5)) to move stone from chest to furnace\n- Burner inserter (position(-45.5, 3.5)) to move stone from chest to furnace\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n* Errors when inserting items into a furnace without having the required items in inventory\n  - Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into a furnace.\n* Errors due to incorrect operand type for unary operations\n  - Check the operand type before performing unary operations to avoid type mismatches.\n* Errors when placing entities next to other entities with insufficient spacing or incorrect direction\n  - Ensure there is sufficient spacing and the correct direction when placing entities next to other entities. Check for nearby entities that might be blocking the placement.\n* Errors when attempting to place an entity at a position occupied by another entity\n  - Ensure the target position is clear of other entities before attempting to place a new entity.\n* Errors when connecting transport belts directly to non-belt entities\n  - Use an inserter to transfer items from non-belt entities (like chests) to transport belts.\n* Errors due to accessing non-existent attributes of an object\n  - Verify the attributes of an object before attempting to access them to avoid attribute errors.\n\n### NAMESPACE\nNo utility functions have been defined by the agent."}
