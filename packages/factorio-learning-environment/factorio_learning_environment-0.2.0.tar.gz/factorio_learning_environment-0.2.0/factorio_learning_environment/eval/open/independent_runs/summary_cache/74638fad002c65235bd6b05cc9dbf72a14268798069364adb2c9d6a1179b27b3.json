{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report: Steps 0-63\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Basic Power Generation at x=-5.0 y=2.5\n*   **Purpose:** Generates steam from water and burns coal to produce electricity.\n*   **Components:**\n    *   Offshore Pump at `Position(x=-9.5, y=-0.5)` extracting water.\n    *   Boiler at `Position(x=-5.0, y=2.5)` consuming coal (refueled in step 62, currently out of fuel) and heating water.\n    *   Steam Engine at `Position(x=-0.5, y=2.5)` consuming steam and generating power.\n    *   Pipe Group connecting Offshore Pump to Boiler (`fluid_system=7306`, positions include `(x=-8.5,y=-0.5)` to `(x=-5.5,y=0.5)`).\n    *   Pipe Group connecting Boiler to Steam Engine (`fluid_system=7309`, positions include `(x=-3.5,y=2.5)` to `(x=1.5,y=6.5)`).\n    *   Connected to the main power grid (`ElectricityGroup id=96491`).\n\n### Iron Mining Setup at x=19.5 y=73.5\n*   **Purpose:** Mines Iron Ore. Previous smelting components and belts were removed (steps 56, 59). Currently non-operational.\n*   **Components:**\n    *   Electric Mining Drill at `Position(x=19"}
