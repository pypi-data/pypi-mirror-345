{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-14.0, -49.0) and (-16.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-14.0, -49.0)\n  - Fueled with coal and processing iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-16.0, -49.0)\n  - Fueled with coal and processing iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -47.5)\n  - Transfers iron plates from the furnace at (-14.0, -49.0) to the wooden chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-13.5, -46.5)\n  - Stores iron plates transferred by the burner inserter.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied or invalid tiles\n- Ensure that the tile is unoccupied and valid for the entity type before attempting to place an entity. This will prevent placement errors such as those encountered with the Transport Belt and Iron Chest.\n\n### Errors in crafting without appropriate facilities\n- Iron plates cannot be crafted manually; they need to be smelted in a furnace. Ensure you have the necessary facilities like furnaces for crafting items that require smelting.\n\n### Errors due to incorrect resource availability\n- Always check your inventory for the required resources before attempting to insert items into entities. This will prevent errors like attempting to insert iron ore when none is available in the inventory.\n\n### Validation errors during entity placement\n- Ensure that the dimensions and parameters for entities like the Stone Furnace are correctly specified and valid integers to avoid validation errors."}
