Ensure that an inserter is added to feed items into the steam engine and use that inserter as the connection target.\n\n\u2022 Entity Placement Distance Errors\n  \u2013 If placement fails because the target position is too far from the player (e.g. distance 15.89 vs. maximum allowed 10), move the player closer to the target position before attempting placement.\n\n\u2022 Undefined Variable Errors\n  \u2013 Errors such as \u201cNameError: name \u2018target_chest\u2019 is not defined\u201d point to incorrect or inconsistent variable naming. Double-check that variable names are defined and used consistently.\n\n\u2022 Missing Inventory Items\n  \u2013 When errors report that an entity (such as a wooden chest) is missing from the inventory, verify and ensure the required item is present before attempting to place it."}
