(New instances at steps 48, 49, 51, 52, 54, 55, 58, 59)\n* Errors when connecting entities:\n  - Ensure that the connection points are not blocked and the target is able to receive the fluid or items.\n* Errors when connecting transport belts directly to furnaces:\n  - Add an inserter that inputs items into the furnace and use the inserter as the target entity. (New instance at step 68)\n* Errors when using incorrect argument types for functions:\n  - Ensure the correct argument types are used for functions, such as using a Direction object when required. (New instance at step 69)\n* Errors when connecting to a position occupied by another entity:\n  - Ensure the target position is not occupied by another entity before attempting to connect to it. (New instance at step 70)\n\n### NAMESPACE\n* Important variables:\n  - `furnace_iron`: Furnace entity, type: `Entity`\n  - `entity`: Entity object, type: `Entity`\n  - `to`: Unknown type, possibly an entity or position\n  - `drill_iron`: Electric mining drill entity, type: `Entity`\n  - `inserter_iron`: Inserter entity, type: `Entity`\n* Utility functions:\n  - `insert_item(item_type: `Prototype`, target: `Entity`, quantity: `int`) -> `Entity`: Inserts a specified quantity of an item into a target entity. \n    - Failure modes: \n      - `Exception: Could not insert: No iron-ore to insert from your inventory` when there are insufficient resources in the inventory.
