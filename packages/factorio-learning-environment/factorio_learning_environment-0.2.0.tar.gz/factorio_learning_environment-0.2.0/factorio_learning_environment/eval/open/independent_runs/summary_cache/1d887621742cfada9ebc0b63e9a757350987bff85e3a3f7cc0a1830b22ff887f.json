{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-13.5, 20.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Boiler at position(-13.5, 20.0)\n- Steam engine at position(-18.5, 19.5)\n- Offshore pump at position(-11.5, 26.5)\n\n### Copper plate factory at position(-21.5, 25.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine at position(-21.5, 25.5)\n- Furnace at position(-18.0, -49.0)\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(-18.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position(-18.0, -49.0) and a furnace at position(-18.0, -49.0)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to steam engine and boiler connections\n- Ensure that the boiler has a continuous supply of fuel to operate effectively. Check the fuel inventory and refill as necessary.\n- Connect steam engines to a valid power source to ensure they operate. Verify that the steam engine is connected to the boiler and that the boiler has water supplied from an offshore pump.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it. Check for existing entities in the intended position.\n\n### Errors related to power supply\n- Ensure that all machines requiring power are connected to a power network. Check for any disconnections in the electricity grid and reconnect as necessary."}
