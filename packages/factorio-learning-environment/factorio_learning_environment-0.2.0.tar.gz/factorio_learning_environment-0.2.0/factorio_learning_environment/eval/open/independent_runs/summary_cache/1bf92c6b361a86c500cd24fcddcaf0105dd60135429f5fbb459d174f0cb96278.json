{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nThere are currently no structures on the map. The agent attempted to place various entities, but none were successfully established as structures.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied or invalid locations\n- Ensure that the target location for placing entities such as Burner Mining Drill, Stone Furnace, Wooden Chest, and Burner Inserter is unoccupied and valid. Verify the space is clear before attempting to place an entity.\n\n### Errors related to the absence of entities\n- Confirm that the necessary entities, such as Stone Furnace, are present on the map before attempting operations that require them. If they are missing, check inventory and place them appropriately.\n\n### Errors when determining buildable locations\n- When attempting to place entities like Burner Mining Drills, ensure that the BuildingBox size is compatible with available space. If placement fails, consider reducing the BuildingBox size or using multiple smaller BuildingBoxes to fit the available area.\n\n### Errors in setup not producing expected outputs\n- If a setup is not producing additional resources like iron plates, review the configuration and connections between entities to ensure they are correctly aligned and functional. Check power supply, input, and output paths for any discrepancies."}
