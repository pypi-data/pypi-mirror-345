{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0) connected to a wooden chest at position (x=40.5, y=-83.5) and another wooden chest at position (x=42.5, y=-83.5).\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=41.5, y=-83.5) transferring items between the chests and the mining drill.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=41.5, y=-79.5) storing coal.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with no fuel and containing iron plates.\n- Furnace at position (x=2.0, y=0.0) with coal as fuel but lacking ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Coal Transportation System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- BeltGroup with inputs from position (x=42.5, y=-83.5) to (x=44.5, y=-83.5) and outputs from position (x=43.5, y=-83.5) to (x=45.5, y=-83.5), transporting coal.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to lack of fuel\n- Ensure all fuel-consuming entities like furnaces and mining drills are adequately refueled to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Errors due to missing ingredients\n- Verify that all furnaces have the necessary ingredients to process, ensuring a consistent supply of raw materials.\n\n### Inserter waiting for source items\n- Check that the inserters have access to the source items they need to transfer, and ensure the source inventory is not empty.\n\n### Burner mining drill out of fuel\n- Regularly check and refuel burner mining drills to prevent them from running out of fuel and halting production."}
