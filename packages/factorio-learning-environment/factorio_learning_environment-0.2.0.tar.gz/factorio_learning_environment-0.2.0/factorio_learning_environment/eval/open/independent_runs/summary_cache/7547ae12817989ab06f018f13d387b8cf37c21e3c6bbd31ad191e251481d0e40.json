{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Transport System (around position 41, -82)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (x=41.0, y=-82.0) mining coal\n- Iron chest (x=41.5, y=-83.5) storing coal (1600 units)\n- Wooden chest (x=41.5, y=-80.5) storing coal (585 units)\n- Burner inserter (x=42.5, y=-80.5) facing RIGHT, moving items from wooden chest\n\n### Iron Plate Storage System (around position 49, -80)\nConsists of:\n- Wooden chest (x=49.5, y=-80.5) storing iron plates (1500 units)\n\n### Furnace Setup (around position 45, -81)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace (x=45.0, y=-81.0)\n- Stone furnace (x=47.0, y=-81.0)\nBoth furnaces are currently idle with no ingredients\n\n### Transport Belt System\n- Belt group running from (x=42.5, y=-68.5) to (x=42.5, y=-77.5), consisting of 10 belts\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Conflicts\n- Before placing entities, check if the target position is already occupied\n- When rebuilding/reorganizing systems, remove existing entities first before placing new ones\n- Ensure proper spacing between entities when designing transport systems\n\n### Transport System Design\n- Plan the complete layout before placing components\n- Ensure proper alignment between inserters, belts, and destination entities\n- Verify that inserters can reach their pickup and drop positions\n\n### System Configuration\n- Verify entity directions match the intended flow of materials\n- Ensure inserters are properly oriented to pick up from source and drop to destination\n- Check that transport belts are oriented in the correct direction for material flow\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nFunctions:\n- place_entity(): Places entities on the map. Fails when target location is occupied.\n\nImportant Variables:\n- chest_inserter: BurnerInserter\n- belt: TransportBelt\n- furnace_inserter: BurnerInserter\n\nCommon failure modes:\n- Placement failures due to existing entities in target locations\n- Inserter placement failures due to incorrect positioning relative to source/destination"}
