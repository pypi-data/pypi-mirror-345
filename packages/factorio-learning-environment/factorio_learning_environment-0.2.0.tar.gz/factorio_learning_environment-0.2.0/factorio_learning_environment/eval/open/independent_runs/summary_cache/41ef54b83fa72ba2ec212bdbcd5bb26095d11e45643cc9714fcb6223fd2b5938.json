{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-2.5, -0.5)\nConsists of offshore pump (position(-9.5, -0.5)), boiler (position(-7.0, -0.5)), pipe group (positions(-8.5, -2.5), (-7.5, -2.5), (-8.5, -1.5), (-8.5, -0.5)) and steam engine (position(-2.5, -0.5))\n\n### Coal mining operation at position(16.0, 0.0)\nConsists of burner mining drill (position(16.0, 0.0)), wooden chest (position(16.5, 1.5)), burner inserter (position(14.5, 1.5)), burner inserter (position(18.5, 1.5)), burner inserter (position(19.5, 1.5)), wooden chest (position(17.5, 1.5)), transport belt group (positions (15.5, 1.5), (13.5, 1.5), (17.5, 0.5), (17.5, 2.5))\n\n### Iron plate production at position(10.0, 5.0)\nConsists of stone furnace (position(10.0, 5.0))\n\n### Logistic science pack production at position(21.5, 1.5)\nConsists of assembling machine (position(21.5, 1.5)), inserter (position(19.5, 1.5)), burner inserter (position(18.5, 1.5)), and burner inserter (position(19.5, 1.5))\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using undefined variables\n- Ensure that variables are defined before using them. For example, 'to' should be defined before being used.\n\n### Errors when connecting entities directly\n- Transport belts cannot be connected directly from a Prototype.WoodenChest object as a source. You need to add an inserter that takes items from Prototype.WoodenChest and use the inserter as a source entity.\n\n### Errors when connecting to an occupied position\n- Ensure that the target position for connection is not occupied by another entity. For example, when connecting an inserter to a belt, make sure the drop position is not occupied.\n\n### Errors when placing entities too far away\n- Ensure that you are within the maximum allowed distance when placing entities. Move closer to the target position before attempting to place the entity.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into a furnace\n- Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into a furnace.\n\n### Errors when researching a technology that is already researched\n- Check if a technology is already researched before attempting to research it again.\n\n### Errors when crafting items without required sub-ingredients\n- Ensure that you have the required sub-ingredients in your inventory or have a machine that can craft them before attempting to craft an item.\n\n### Errors when getting non-existent entities\n- Ensure that the entity you are trying to get exists at the specified position before attempting to get it. For example, when trying to get a BurnerInserter at a certain position, make sure it exists there.\n\n### Errors when using incorrect prototype names\n- Ensure that you use the correct prototype names when crafting items. For example, 'LogisticsSciencePack' instead of 'LogisticSciencePack'.\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied positions\n- Ensure that the target position for placing an entity is not occupied by another entity.\n\n### Errors when passing incorrect arguments to functions\n- Ensure that you pass the correct arguments to functions. For example, when calling 'place_entity', ensure that you pass the correct entity and position.\n\n### Errors when using incorrect direction objects\n- Ensure that you use the correct direction objects when required. For example, when specifying the direction for an entity.\n\n### Errors when placing entities next to an occupied position\n- Ensure that the position next to the target entity is not occupied by another entity. Consider increasing the spacing, changing the direction or changing the reference position.\n\n### Errors when placing an entity that already exists at the target position\n- Ensure that the target position for placing an entity is not already occupied by the same entity.\n\n### Errors when inspecting inventory with incorrect arguments\n- Ensure that you pass the correct arguments when inspecting an inventory. For example, when calling 'inspect_inventory', ensure that you pass the correct entity and inventory type.\n\n### Errors when using the result of a function that may return a boolean value\n- Be aware of the return type of functions and handle them appropriately. For example, if a function returns a boolean value indicating success or failure, check this value before attempting to use the result as an object.\n\n### Errors when attempting to place entities with insufficient spacing\n- When attempting to place entities next to each other, ensure there is sufficient spacing"}
