{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining Complex at position(x=37-41, y=-83 to -87)\nConsists of following entities:\n- 4 Burner mining drills at positions (41.0,-86.0), (37.0,-85.0), (39.0,-85.0), (41.0,-83.0)\n- 4 Wooden chests at positions (40.5,-87.5), (36.5,-86.5), (39.5,-83.5)\n- 2 Burner inserters at positions (35.5,-86.5), (35.5,-85.5)\nAll drills are mining coal deposits. Currently out of fuel.\n\n### Iron/Copper Ore Processing at position(x=-28, y=-61)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-28.0,-61.0) mining copper and iron ore\n- Stone furnace at (-27.0,-58.0)\n- Wooden chest at (-27.5,-59.5) containing iron and copper ore\n- Burner inserter at (-26.5,-59.5) moving materials between chest and furnace\n- Output chest at (-24.5,-58.5) containing processed plates\n- Additional furnaces at (-23.0,-58.0), (-21.0,-58.0) with burner inserters\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Complex at position(x=-10 to -6, y=-59)\nConsists of:\n- 3 Burner mining drills at positions (-10.0,-59.0), (-8.0,-59.0), (-6.0,-59.0)\n- Multiple wooden chests and burner inserters for ore collection\n- Transport belt system connecting components\n\n### Smelting Array at position(x=0 to 6, y=0)\nConsists of:\n- 4 Stone furnaces at positions (0.0,0.0), (2.0,0.0), (4.0,0.0), (6.0,0.0)\n- Input/output inserters and chests for each furnace\n- Transport belt system for material movement\n\n### Power Generation System at position(x=4.5, y=20.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam engine at (4.5,20.5)\n- Boiler at (-1.5,22.0)\n- Offshore pump at (-3.5,27.5)\n- Pipe network connecting components\n- Electric poles creating power network\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Extraction distance errors\n- Must be within reach distance of target chest when attempting to extract items\n\n### Entity placement conflicts\n- Check if target position is clear before placing new entities\n- Remove blocking entities or choose different position\n\n### Resource management issues\n- Multiple burner mining drills are out of fuel - ensure continuous fuel supply\n- Some chests are reaching capacity - implement better item movement systems\n\n### Fluid system warnings\n- Steam engine shows \"no input liquid\" - ensure proper pipe connections\n- Verify fluid flow direction in pipe networks\n\n### Inserter efficiency\n- Several inserters showing \"waiting for source items\" - optimize input/output flows\n- Some inserters blocked by full destination inventories - manage storage capacity"}
