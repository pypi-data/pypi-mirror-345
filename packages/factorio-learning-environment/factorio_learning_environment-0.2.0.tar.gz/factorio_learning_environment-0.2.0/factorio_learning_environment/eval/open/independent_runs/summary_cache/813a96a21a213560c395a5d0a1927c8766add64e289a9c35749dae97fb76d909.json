{"content": "# Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at Position (-15.0, -50.0) extracting iron ore, with a drop position at (-14.5, -48.5).\n- **Wooden Chests** at Positions (-14.5, -48.5) and (-15.5, -48.5) for storage.\n- **Burner Inserter** at Position (-13.5, -48.5) transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace 1** at Position (-12.0, -48.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Stone Furnace 2** at Position (-10.0, -48.0) currently not smelting due to lack of ingredients.\n- **Burner Inserters** at Positions (-14.5, -47.5), (-11.5, -46.5), and (-11.5, -45.5) for transferring items between entities.\n- **Wooden Chests** at Positions (-14.5, -46.5), (-6.5, -49.5), (-6.5, -48.5), (-7.5, -48.5), (-5.5, -48.5), (-4.5, -48.5), and (-3.5, -48.5) for storing iron plates and other resources.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Extracting Items\n- Ensure the target entity has the required items available for extraction before attempting to extract. Check the inventory of the entity to confirm the presence of the items.\n\n### Inserter Blockage Issues\n- Ensure that the destination of the inserter is clear and has space available to receive items. Regularly check and clear blockages to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Errors when Using Extracting but Being Too Far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when Placing into a Tile Which is Occupied by Another Entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
