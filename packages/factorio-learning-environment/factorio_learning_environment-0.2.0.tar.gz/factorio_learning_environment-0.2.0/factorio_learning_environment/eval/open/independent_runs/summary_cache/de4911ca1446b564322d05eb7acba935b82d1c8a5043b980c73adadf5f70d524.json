{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=1.5, y=23.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\n- Pipe Group connecting various components, including positions from (x=3.5, y=17.5) to (x=10.5, y=21.5)\n- Pipe Group for water supply, from (x=-9.5, y=23.5) to (x=-0.5, y=23.5)\n- Electricity Poles for power distribution, spanning positions such as (x=24.5, y=22.5), (x=35.5, y=20.5), and others.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Fluid Connections\n- Ensure that all fluid connections are properly established. The steam engine has warnings of \"no input liquid\" and \"no fluid present in connections.\" Verify that all necessary pipes are connected and that there is a continuous path for fluids.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Fuel\n- The boiler is out of fuel. Regularly check fuel levels in boilers and other fuel-dependent structures to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Errors in Electricity Generation\n- The electricity poles have a voltage of 0, indicating a lack of power generation. Ensure that the steam engine is operational and connected to the electricity network to generate power."}
