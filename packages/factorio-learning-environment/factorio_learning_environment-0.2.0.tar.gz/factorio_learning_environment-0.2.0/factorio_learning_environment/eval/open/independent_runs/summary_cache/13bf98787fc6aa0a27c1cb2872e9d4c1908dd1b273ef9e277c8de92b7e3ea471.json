{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Collection and Transfer System at position (x=42.0, y=-83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=42.0, y=-83.0), which is currently working but has a warning about output being blocked due to no sink entity.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=42.5, y=-81.5), which is waiting for source items and is fueled with coal. It transfers coal from the mining drill to the wooden chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=43.5, y=-80.5), used to collect coal from the burner inserter.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at position (x=-15.0, y=-49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-15.0, y=-49.0), which is out of fuel. It processes iron ore into iron plates. Currently has 41 iron ore and has produced 88 iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied positions\n- Ensure you can place an entity in a tile before attempting to place it. This includes checking if the intended position is free of other entities or obstacles.\n\n### Errors with BuildingBox dimensions\n- Verify that the dimensions for entities like Wooden Chests are correctly specified and of the correct data type. Ensure that width and height are integers or compatible types.\n\n### Errors with 'Position' object usage\n- Avoid using 'Position' objects incorrectly. Ensure that the 'Position' object is being used as intended and not being called as a function.\n\n### Errors with misaligned inserter positions\n- Align inserters correctly with the drop position of the drill to ensure smooth transfer of items. Adjust positions as necessary to prevent blockages.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items."}
