{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=22.5, y=-7.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (x=22.5, y=-7.5)\n- Boiler at Position (x=20.5, y=-4.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (x=4.5, y=-10.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting the boiler and steam engine with positions ranging from (x=20.5, y=-10.5) to (x=20.5, y=-5.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting the offshore pump with positions ranging from (x=4.5, y=-9.5) to (x=8.5, y=-7.5)\n- Small Electric Poles at various positions for power distribution\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at Position (x=20.0, y=20.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (x=20.0, y=20.0)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (x=19.5, y=18.5) for storing copper ore\n\n### Iron Plate Mine at Position (x=-11.0, y=20.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (x=-11.0, y=20.0)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (x=-11.5, y=18.5) for storing iron ore\n\n### Copper Cable Factory\nConsists of:\n- Assembling Machine at Position (x=10.5, y=0.5) with a recipe for copper cable\n- Inserter at Position (x=7.5, y=5.5) connected to the assembling machine\n- BeltGroup connecting the assembling machine with positions ranging from (x=10.5, y=4.5) to (x=7.5, y=6.5)\n- Small Electric Poles at various positions for power distribution\n\n### Iron Smelting Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=2.0, y=0.0) with a warning of no ingredients to smelt\n- Inserter and Wooden Chest setup for input and output management\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Missing Ingredients\n- Ensure that all required ingredients are available for the assembling machine to avoid shortages. For example, the assembling machine at Position (x=10.5, y=0.5) is missing copper plates to produce copper cables.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Source Items\n- Make sure that inserters are positioned correctly and have access to source items to avoid waiting for source items. For example, the inserter at Position (x=-3.5, y=1.5) is waiting for source items.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Operations\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt to avoid warnings of no ingredients. The furnace at Position (x=2.0, y=0.0) is currently not smelting due to a lack of ingredients.\n\n### Errors with Full Output Status\n- Regularly check and clear outputs to prevent entities like furnaces from reaching full output status, which halts production."}
