Misalignment can prevent items from being transferred, halting production.\n\n### Errors in Inventory Management\n- Regularly check and manage the inventory of chests and furnaces to prevent them from becoming full, which can stop production processes. Empty chests and furnaces as needed to maintain workflow.\n\n### Errors in Resource Allocation\n- Ensure that there is enough coal in the inventory to refuel all necessary entities. Running out of fuel can cause production delays.\n\n### Errors in Furnace Operation\n- Confirm that furnaces are receiving the correct input materials and have sufficient fuel to process them into the desired output."}
