{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (17.5, 20.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (17.5, 20.5) with warnings for 'no input liquid' and 'no fluid present in connections', status: NOT_CONNECTED\n- Boiler at Position (1.5, 23.0) with warning 'out of fuel', status: NO_FUEL\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-9.5, 24.5), status: WORKING\n- Pipe connections linking the boiler and offshore pump to the steam engine, with various positions including (1.5, 21.5) and (-9.5, 23.5)\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- PipeGroup at Position (9.5, 15.5), status: EMPTY\n- PipeGroup at Position (6.5, 21.5), status: EMPTY\n- PipeGroup at Position (-9.5, 23.5), fluid: water, status: FULL_OUTPUT\n\n### Electricity Network\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at various positions including (1.5, 10.5), (10.5, 13.5), and (1.5, 6.5), voltage: 0\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors when Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure that the entities you are trying to connect are compatible and correctly aligned. The connection attempt between a pipe at (1.5, 21.5) and a steam engine at (17.5, 20.5) failed due to incompatible or misaligned entities. Double-check the positions and types of entities before attempting connections.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Fuel\n- Ensure that boilers have sufficient fuel to operate. The boiler at (1.5, 23.0) is out of fuel, preventing the generation of steam necessary for the steam engine.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - `connect_entities`: Attempts to connect two entities using specified prototypes. Failure occurred due to incompatible or misaligned entities between positions (1.5, 21.5) and (17.5, 20.5).\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `pipes`: List of connected pipe entities, type: List[Entity]\n  - `inventory`: Dictionary of current inventory items, type: Dict[str, int]"}
