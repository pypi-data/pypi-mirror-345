{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll generate a new report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n###Main Belt Line System\n- Large belt network with 105 belts running from south to north\n- Main input at (-4.5, -54.5) facing UP\n- Main output at (44.5, -81.5) facing RIGHT\n- Currently transporting iron ore and coal\n- Belt inventory shows active material flow with varying amounts of iron ore (10-38 pieces) and coal (1 piece)\n\n###Mining Output Connection\n- Small belt system (2-4 belts) connecting mining operation to main belt line\n- Inserter at position (-5.5, -52.5) facing RIGHT\n- Connection belts at (-4.5, -53.5) and (-4.5, -52.5) facing DOWN\n- System underwent multiple reconfigurations to optimize flow\n\nERROR TIPS\n1. Belt Blockage Issues\n- Clear existing belts before placing new ones in the same position\n- Check belt contents and ensure proper flow before making modifications\n- Verify belt direction matches intended material flow direction\n\n2. Belt Connection Problems\n- Ensure proper alignment between inserter drop position and belt input\n- Verify belt connections are continuous without gaps\n- Match belt directions when connecting to existing belt lines\n\n3. Inserter Placement Issues\n- Confirm inserter drop position aligns with belt input position\n- Ensure sufficient space for inserter operation\n- Verify inserter rotation matches intended material flow direction\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nVariables:\n- direction: Direction (enum)\n- position: Tuple[float, float]\n- inventory: Inventory (custom type containing item counts)\n\nBelt System Properties:\n- status: EntityStatus (enum: WORKING, EMPTY, WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION)\n- inventory: Dict[str, int]\n- inputs: List[Belt]\n- outputs: List[Belt]\n\nNotable State:\n- Main belt line direction: Direction.UP\n- Current inventory tracking iron ore, coal, iron plates, wooden chests, transport belts, and burner inserters\n- Belt group tracking system monitoring multiple independent belt networks"}
