{"content": "# FACTORIO REPORT\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System at Position(-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position(-9.5, -0.5)\n- Boiler at position(-5.0, 2.5)\n- Steam engine at position(0.5, 6.5)\n- Connected with pipes between components\n- Boiler has been fueled with coal but is currently out of fuel\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility at Position(15.5, 70.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill 1 at position(15.5, 70.5) mining iron ore\n- Electric mining drill 2 at position(18.5, 70.5) mining iron ore\n- Stone furnace 1 at position(16.0, 76.0) for smelting iron ore into plates\n- Stone furnace 2 at position(18.0, 76.0) for smelting iron ore into plates\n- Input inserter 1 at position(16.5, 74.5) to feed furnace 1\n- Input inserter 2 at position(18.5, 74.5) to feed furnace 2\n- Output inserter 1 at position(16.5, 77.5) to extract from furnace 1\n- Output inserter 2 at position(18.5, 77.5) to extract from furnace 2\n- Wooden chest 1 at position(16.5, 78.5) to collect iron plates from furnace 1\n- Wooden chest 2 at position(18.5, 78.5) to collect iron plates from furnace 2\n- Transport belt system connecting mining drills to furnaces\n- Small electric poles at positions(15.5, 73.5), (17.5, 73.5), and (17.5, 77.5) to power the facility\n\nThe facility is currently not operational as the electric mining drills and inserters are not receiving power.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting transport belts to furnaces\n- Transport belts cannot be connected directly to furnaces. Use inserters to move items from belts into furnaces.\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied spaces\n- Check if a position is already occupied before placing an entity. Remove existing entities first if needed.\n- When placing inserters, ensure there's enough space and no other entities are in the way.\n\n### Errors with power connections\n- Ensure power poles are within connection range of each other.\n- When connecting power between distant entities, place intermediate power poles to bridge the gap.\n- Power poles have a limited connection range, so place them close enough to connect.\n\n### Errors with entity attributes\n- BeltGroup objects don't have a 'direction' attribute. Access individual belts within the group instead.\n\n### Errors with entity placement\n- Check the terrain before placing entities - some entities cannot be placed on water or other unplaceable terrain.\n- Ensure there's enough space for the entity being placed, considering its full dimensions."}
