{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-2.5, 24.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (-5.5, 19.5) with status: WORKING\n- Boiler at position (-2.5, 24.0) with status: WORKING\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5) with status: WORKING\n- Pipe Group (steam) connecting the boiler and steam engine, with pipes at positions such as (-4.5, 16.5), (-5.5, 16.5), (-2.5, 17.5), etc.\n- Pipe Group (water) connecting the offshore pump and boiler, with pipes at positions such as (-9.5, 23.5), (-8.5, 23.5), (-7.5, 23.5), etc.\n- Electricity Group with small electric poles at positions (-7.5, 22.5), (-6.5, 22.5), and (-1.5, 20.5), though not fully operational as indicated by the status: NOT_PLUGGED_IN_ELECTRIC_NETWORK\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with status: NO_INGREDIENTS\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inventory Management\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities. For example, attempting to insert coal into the boiler without having coal in the inventory resulted in an error.\n\n### Errors with Connecting Entities\n- Ensure that you have the necessary items, such as pipes, in your inventory before attempting to connect entities. Multiple attempts to connect pipes between the offshore pump and boiler failed due to insufficient inventory.\n- Verify the connection points and paths when connecting entities like pipes and electric poles to ensure they are correctly aligned and reachable.\n\n### Errors with Power Supply\n- Make sure all parts of the electricity network are connected and powered. The electricity group at various positions indicated a need for power, suggesting incomplete connections or missing components.\n\n### Errors with Entity Placement\n- Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to place entities. For instance, attempting to place a small electric pole without having one in the inventory led to an error.\n\n### Assertion Errors\n- Regularly check the status of critical entities like the steam engine to ensure they are working as expected. An assertion error indicated that the steam engine was not working, which could be due to connectivity or fuel issues."}
