{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) extracting iron ore and transferring it to:\n  - Wooden Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Burner Inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) which moves iron ore from the chest to:\n    - Stone Furnace at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-10.0, y=-48.0) which is used for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-8.5, y=-47.5) which attempts to move iron plates from the furnace to:\n  - Wooden Chest at position (x=-7.5, y=-47.5).\n\n### Storage and Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-46.5) used for storing iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5) which transfers iron ore from the chest at (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) to the chest at (x=-14.5, y=-46.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when extracting iron plates from non-existent entities\n- Ensure that the wooden chest at position (x=-7.5, y=-47.5) contains iron plates before attempting to extract them.\n\n### Errors when inserting items with insufficient inventory\n- Verify that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity.\n\n### Errors with inserters waiting for source items\n- Ensure that the source entity contains items for the inserter to transfer. Check that the inserter's pickup position is correctly aligned with the source entity.\n\n### Errors with inserters waiting for space in destination\n- Ensure that there is enough space in the destination entity for the inserter to transfer items. Check that the drop position is not blocked."}
