{"content": "Based on the execution logs, here's the updated report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Plate Production Line\nConsists of three stone furnaces:\n- Furnace 1 at position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Furnace 2 at position (2.0, 0.0)\n- Furnace 3 at position (4.0, 4.0)\nAll furnaces are used for smelting copper ore into copper plates.\n\n### Copper Cable Production Line\nLocated around position (9.5, 11.5), consists of:\n- Input chest at (6.5, 11.5) containing iron plates and copper plates\n- Burner inserter at (7.5, 11.5) moving items from input chest to assembler\n- Assembling machine at (9.5, 11.5) producing copper cables\n- Burner inserter at (11.5, 11.5) moving products to output chest\n- Output chest at (12.5, 11.5) containing iron plates, copper plates and electronic circuits\n\n### Power Generation System\nLocated around position (-7.0, 24.5), consists of:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, 24.5) providing water\n- Pipe network connecting water flow\n- Boiler at (-7.0, 24.5) heating water into steam\n- Steam engine at (-2.5, 24.5) generating electricity\n- Electric pole network distributing power\n\n### Science Pack System\nLocated around position (0.5, 28.5), consists of:\n- Lab with research set to electronics\n- Burner inserter at (0.5, 30.5) feeding science packs\n- Storage chest at (0.5, 31.5) containing automation and logistics science packs\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Research Prerequisites Errors\n- Check technology prerequisites before attempting to research. Electronics is required before Automation 2\n- Don't try to research already completed technologies like Logistics\n\n### Inventory Management Errors\n- Check if there are sufficient materials in inventory before attempting insertions\n- Monitor coal levels for burner devices to maintain operation\n\n### Container Capacity Errors\n- Monitor chest capacities before inserting items - the output chest at (12.5, 11.5) has reached its capacity limit\n\n### Assembly Machine Operation Errors\n- Ensure assembly machines have required input materials before attempting to extract products\n- Wait for assembly completion before attempting to extract products\n\n### Resource Management\n- Maintain steady supply of raw materials (copper ore, coal) to keep production lines running\n- Monitor and clear blocked inserter paths regularly to maintain workflow"}
