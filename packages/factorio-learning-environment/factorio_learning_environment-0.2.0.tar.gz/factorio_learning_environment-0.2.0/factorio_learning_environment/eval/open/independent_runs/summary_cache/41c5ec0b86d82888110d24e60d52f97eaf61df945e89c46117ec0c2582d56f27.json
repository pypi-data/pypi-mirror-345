{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, -60.0) with a drop chest at position (4.5, -58.5).\n- **Storage Chests** at positions (-16.5, -54.5), (-15.5, -54.5), (-14.5, -54.5), and (-13.5, -54.5) for storing iron plates and iron ore.\n- **Furnaces** at positions (-15.0, -48.0), (-13.0, -48.0), and (-11.0, -48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (5.5, -60.5), (7.5, -60.5), (6.5, -60.5), (9.5, -60.5), and (8.5, -60.5) for storing iron plates.\n- **Iron Chests** at positions (-3.5, -52.5), (-6.5, -50.5), and (-5.5, -50.5) for storing large quantities of iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when managing inventory transfers\n- Ensure that the target storage chests have sufficient capacity before transferring items. This will prevent overflow and loss of items.\n\n### Errors related to mining drill output\n- Regularly empty the drop chest at the mining drill's output position (4.5, -58.5) to prevent mining stoppage due to a full chest.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the current inventory of items such as 'wooden-chest', 'wood', 'coal', 'iron-ore', 'iron-plate', and 'iron-gear-wheel'.\n- `entities_on_map`: List[Entity] - Represents the entities currently placed on the map, including their positions and statuses."}
