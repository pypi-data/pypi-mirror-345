Initially flagged NO_FUEL, it has now been refueled (fuel inventory updated to {'coal': 4}, energy=32000.0) and shows status FULL_OUTPUT. It maintains two output connection points at (x=-28.5, y=31.5) and (x=-28.5, y=35.5); its fluid_box now contains both water and steam.\n\u2013 Offshore Pump at (x=1.5, y=32.5) integrated through a new PipeGroup.\n\u2013 Interlinking pipe connections ensure water delivery.\nAdditional Update:\n\u2003\u2022 Multiple attempts to integrate the Remote Boiler\u2019s steam output (located at x=-30.5, y=33.5) into the fluid network have failed. Connection attempts using Prototype.Pipe targeting a candidate PipeGroup at (x=-0.5, y=5.5) resulted in placement blockage errors, and subsequent searches for a valid working PipeGroup with fluid 'steam' near (x=-30.5, y=29.5) yielded no suitable candidate. Forced connection attempts using fluid system matching were also unsuccessful, leaving the steam output unintegrated.\n\n### Expanded Smelting Zone\nConsists of:\n\u2013 Stone Furnaces at (x=-20.0, y=22.0), (x=-20.0, y=25.0) and (x=-17.0, y=25.0).\n\u2013 Stone Furnace at (x=0.0, y=26.0) dedicated to copper smelting.\n\u2013 (An intended Furnace at (x=-17.0, y=22.0) was not placed due to a blocking pipe group.)\n\u2013 New additions:\n\u2003\u2022 Steam Engine (Generator) at (x=1.5, y=28.5) with connection points at (x=4.0, y=28.5) and (x=-1.0, y=28.5); it continues to warn of missing power/inputs.\n\u2003\u2022 Paired Burner Inserters at (x=-4.5, y=26.5) and (x=-3.5, y=27.5) showing out\u2011of\u2011fuel warnings and interfacing with adjacent transport belts.\n\n### New Network Structures\nConsists of:\n\u2013 Long\u2011distance Transport Belt Network spanning from (x=-3.5, y=10.5) to (x=22.5, y=10.5) with 29 belts (EMPTY).\n\u2013 Copper Ore Transport Line (region x\u22488\u20139, y\u224811\u201315) comprising 6 belts (WORKING; carrying copper\u2011ore).\n\u2013 Integrated Auxiliary Transport Network with a primary 23\u2011belt segment (EMPTY) and a secondary 16\u2011belt segment (EMPTY).\n\u2013 Short Belt Connectors:\n\u2003\u2022 Connector A: approximately (x\u2248\u20130.5 to \u20131.5, y\u224820.5) with 2 belts (EMPTY).\n\u2003\u2022 Connector B: around (x\u2248\u20134.5 to \u20135.5) with 2 belts (EMPTY).\n\u2013 Two standalone Transport Belts at (x=-2.5, y=26.5) and (x=-1.5, y=27.5).\n\n### Auxiliary Boiler\u2013Steam Engine Connection Attempts\nConsists of:\n\u2013 Steam Engine at (x=16.5, y=20.5) exhibiting connection failures.\n\u2013 Steam Engine at (x=21.5, y=19.5) with similar connectivity issues.\n\n### Remote Fluid Network Bridge at position (x=-0.5, y=5.5)\nConsists of:\n\u2013 A connected PipeGroup retrieved at approximately (x=-0.5, y=5.5) with detailed segments starting at (x=-0.5, y=4.5).\n\u2013 The pipe chain spans from (x=-0.5, y=4.5) through (x=-0.5, y=5.5) and extends to (x=20.5, y=14.5) using 16+ pipes.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 Connection Placement Blockage:\n\u2003\u2013 Ensure unobstructed connection paths between fluid outlets and target PipeGroups. Placement blockage errors (e.g. failure to connect from pipe at (x=-30.5, y=33.5) to pipe at (x=-0.5, y=5.5)) indicate that the intended connection area is occupied or misaligned; verify spatial clearance before connecting.\n\n\u2022 PipeGroup Retrieval and Target Selection:\n\u2003\u2013 When searching for PipeGroups with specific fluid attributes (such as \u2018steam\u2019) and a WORKING status near a designated location, use appropriately tuned tolerance radii. Overly strict or mismatched search parameters may return no valid candidates, as observed near (x=-30.5, y=29.5).\n\n\u2022 Boiler Output Integration:\n\u2003\u2013 Confirm that all designated output connection points on the Remote Boiler are accessible and free of obstructions.\n\u2003\u2013 Verify that connection attempts target a PipeGroup with matching fluid attributes (e.g. \u2018steam\u2019 rather than a generic or \u2018N/A\u2019 assignment) to ensure proper alignment.\n\n\u2022 API Parameter Verification:\n\u2003\u2013 Double\u2011check search filters and placement parameters so that connection points, fluid expectations, and spatial positions align with the intended targets.\n\u2003\u2013 Validate that neither the source nor target connection zones are blocked by adjacent entities before attempting to connect.\n\n\u2022 Consistency in Fluid Network Status:\n\u2003\u2013 Monitor the operational status of fluid producers (such as the Remote Boiler) to ensure they remain in the proper state (FULL_OUTPUT) during connection attempts.\n\u2003\u2013 Revalidate the contents of the fluid_box to confirm that the produced fluid (water and steam) meets bridging requirements.\n\n\u2022 General Error Mitigations:\n\u2003\u2013 Maintain sufficient fuel inventories to avoid unintended status changes during integration.\n\u2003\u2013 Regularly review and update spatial coordinates and connection tolerances to minimize repeated connection failures."}
