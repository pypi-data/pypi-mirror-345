{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report (Updated)\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power generation facility at x=-9.5 to x=-4.5\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump (x=-9.5, y=1.5) - connected to pipe network 9040 (water)\n- Offshore pump (x=-9.5, y=-0.5) - newly placed but not connected\n- Boiler (x=-5.5, y=0.0) - contains 27 coal, connected to pipe network 9040\n- New boiler (x=-8.0, y=0.5) - contains coal\n- New steam engine (x=-4.5, y=0.5) - placed but not connected\n- Pipe-to-ground connection (x=-6.5, y=-1.5) - disconnected\n- Additional boiler (x=-6.5, y=10.0) - contains 7 coal, connected to pipe network 9046\n- Offshore pump (x=-9.5, y=9.5) - connected to pipe network 9046 (water)\n\n### Oil production facility at x=17.5 to x=40.5\nConsists of:\n- Pumpjack (x=17.5, y=40.5) - operational but no power\n- Oil refinery (x=27.5, y=40.5) - no power, configured for basic oil processing\n- Storage tank (x=32.5, y=40.5) - operational\n- Chemical plant (x=40.5, y=40.5) - configured for plastic production but missing coal\n- Inserter (x=37.5, y=38.5) - misconfigured (drops to ground), no power\n- Wooden chest (x=37.5, y=37.5) - empty\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Fluid connection failures\n- Offshore pump to boiler connection failed (step 112)\n  - Verify alignment between connection points\n  - Ensure no obstructions between entities\n  - Check fluid types match between connected entities\n\n### Power system issues\n- Steam engine not connected (step 112)\n- Chemical plant lacks power (step 112)\n  - Complete all power connections\n  - Verify electrical pole coverage\n\n### Resource shortages\n- Chemical plant missing coal for plastic production (step 112)\n  - Maintain adequate coal supply chain\n  - Verify input resources before production setup\n\n### Persistent problems from previous steps:\n1. Fix all fluid connections with proper alignment\n2. Complete power generation system connections\n3. Maintain adequate inventory of critical components\n4. Validate entity existence before interaction\n5. Ensure proper resource supply chains\n\n### Recommended immediate actions:\n1. Connect new offshore pump at x=-9.5 y=-0.5 to boiler\n2. Connect steam engine at x=-4.5 y=0.5 to power network\n3. Supply coal to chemical plant at x=40.5 y=40.5\n4. Verify all pipe connections in oil facility"}
