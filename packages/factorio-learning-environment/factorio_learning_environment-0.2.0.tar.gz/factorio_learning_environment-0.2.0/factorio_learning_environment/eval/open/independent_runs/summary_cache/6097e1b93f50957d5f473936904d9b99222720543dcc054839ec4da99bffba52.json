{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Extraction and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n  - Status: WORKING\n  - Fuel: Coal (3 units)\n  - Neighbours: \n    - Wooden Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n    - Burner Inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Resources: Iron Ore (10,000 units available)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Status: NORMAL\n  - Inventory: Iron Ore (494 units)\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Status: WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS\n  - Fuel: Coal (4 units)\n  - Neighbours: \n    - Wooden Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n    - Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n  - Pickup Position: (x=-12.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Drop Position: (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\n  - Status: NO_INGREDIENTS\n  - Fuel: Coal (9 units)\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Furnace Source: Empty\n  - Furnace Result: Iron Plate (2 units)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Setup\n- Ensure that inserters are correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items between entities. Misalignment may prevent the transfer of resources, as seen with the repeated repositioning of the inserter at (x=-13.5, y=-48.5).\n\n### Errors with Fuel Management\n- Maintain sufficient fuel in your inventory to refuel entities. An error occurred when attempting to insert coal into an inserter due to insufficient coal in the inventory.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Operations\n- Verify that furnaces are receiving the necessary ingredients to operate. The furnace at (x=0.0, y=0.0) is not receiving iron ore, preventing it from smelting iron plates. Check the inserter setup and ensure the continuous supply of raw materials to the furnace."}
