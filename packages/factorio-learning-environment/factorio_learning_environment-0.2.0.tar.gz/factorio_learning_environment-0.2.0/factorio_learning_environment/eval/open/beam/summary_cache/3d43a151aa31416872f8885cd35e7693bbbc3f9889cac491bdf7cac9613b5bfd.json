{"content": "The error is due to attempting to use `.values()` on the `Inventory` object, which doesn't support this method. Instead, we should directly iterate over the keys of the inventory to check if it's empty.\n\nLet's correct the approach to check if the furnace is empty and proceed with the insertion:\n\n```python\n# Check player's inventory for available coal and ores\nplayer_inventory = inspect_inventory()\nprint(f\"Player Inventory: {player_inventory}\")\n\n# Check whether the furnace inventory is empty by inspecting each item count\nfurnace_inventory = inspect_inventory(furnace_entity)\nis_furnace_empty = all(furnace_inventory.get(item, 0) == 0 for item in [Prototype.Coal, Prototype.IronOre, Prototype.IronPlate, Prototype.CopperOre, Prototype.CopperPlate])\n\nif is_furnace_empty:\n    print(\"Furnace is confirmed to be empty.\")\n\n    # Attempt to insert coal into the furnace if available\n    if player_inventory.get(Prototype.Coal, 0) > 0:\n        try:\n            insert_item(Prototype.Coal, furnace_entity, quantity=1)\n            print(\"Coal inserted successfully into the furnace.\")\n        except Exception as e:\n            print(f\"Failed to insert coal: {e}\")\n\n    # Insert iron ore into the furnace if available\n    if player_inventory.get(Prototype.IronOre, 0) > 0:\n        try:\n            insert_item(Prototype.IronOre, furnace_entity, quantity=5)\n            print(\"Iron Ore inserted successfully into the furnace.\")\n        except Exception as e:\n            print(f\"Failed to insert iron ore: {e}\")\n\n# Final verification to ensure the furnace inventory is updated post operations\nfinal_furnace_inventory = inspect_inventory(furnace_entity)\nprint(f\"Final Furnace Inventory: {final_furnace_inventory}\")\n```\n\nThis code snippet correctly checks if the furnace is empty by iterating over each item type and checking their counts. It then attempts to insert coal and iron ore into the furnace if they are available in the player's inventory.", "summary_range": "[1-88]"}
