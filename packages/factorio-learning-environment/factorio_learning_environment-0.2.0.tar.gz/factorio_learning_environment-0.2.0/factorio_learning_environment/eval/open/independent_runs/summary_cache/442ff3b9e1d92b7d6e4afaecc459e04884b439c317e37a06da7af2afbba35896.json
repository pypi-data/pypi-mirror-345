{"content": "# Factorio Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone furnace at position (0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position (0, 0)) with coal as fuel and currently 18 iron plates produced.\n\n### Stone furnace at position (2, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position (2, 0)) with coal as fuel and currently no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Stone furnace at position (4, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position (4, 0)) with coal as fuel and currently no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Stone furnace at position (6, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position (6, 0)) with coal as fuel and currently no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Wooden chest at position (8.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest (position (8.5, 0.5)) containing 6 wood.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items into a full inventory\n- Ensure that the target entity (e.g., furnace) has available space in its inventory before attempting to insert items. Check the inventory status before executing the insert command.\n\n### Errors when crafting items due to missing ingredients\n- Ensure that all required ingredients are available in the inventory or accessible from the connected entities before attempting to craft items. Verify that the necessary crafting machines or furnaces are operational and have the required ingredients.\n\n### Repeated errors in item insertion and crafting\n- Review the steps for inserting items into the furnace and crafting gear wheels. Make sure to manage inventory space effectively and confirm that all necessary resources are present before executing crafting commands.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into the second furnace\n- Ensure that the second furnace has available space in its inventory before attempting to insert items. Similar to the first furnace, check the inventory status before executing the insert command.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into the first furnace\n- Ensure that the first furnace has available space in its inventory before attempting to insert items. Check the inventory status before executing the insert command.\n\n### Errors when crafting gear wheels due to insufficient iron plates\n- Confirm that there are enough iron plates available in the inventory or accessible from the connected entities before attempting to craft iron gear wheels. Ensure that the furnaces are operational and have the necessary ingredients to produce iron plates.\n\n### Errors when adding coal to the first furnace\n- Ensure that there is enough coal in the inventory before attempting to add coal to the furnace. Check inventory levels before executing the insert command."}
