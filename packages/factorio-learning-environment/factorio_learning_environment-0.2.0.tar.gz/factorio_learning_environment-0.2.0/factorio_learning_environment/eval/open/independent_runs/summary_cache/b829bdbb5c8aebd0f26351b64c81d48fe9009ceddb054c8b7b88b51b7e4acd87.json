{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-44.5, -124.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Boiler at position (-44.5, -124.0)\n- Steam engine at position (-40.5, -113.5)\n- Multiple small electric poles connecting the steam engine to the power network\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (-15.0, -76.0) with a wooden chest at position (-15.5, -77.5)\n- Stone furnace at position (-19.0, -73.0)\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace at position (9.0, -64.0)\n\n### Additional Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace at position (6.0, -62.0)\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) connected to a wooden chest at position (6.5, -59.5)\n\n### Pipe Networks\nMultiple pipe groups at various positions, including:\n- PipeGroup at position (-36.5, -123.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (-48.5, -112.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (-37.5, -111.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (-42.5, -109.5)\n- Additional pipe networks at positions (0.5, 10.5), (-0.5, 17.5), (-12.5, 23.5), (-5.5, 24.5), (1.5, 24.5), and (2.5, 25.5)\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of multiple small electric poles forming a network, with poles at positions such as (-2.5, -83.5), (2.5, -82.5), (3.5, -83.5), and extending to (17.5, -69.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure that all pipe connections are correctly aligned and connected to the appropriate entities. Double-check that the entities you are trying to connect have the necessary input and output connections available.\n\n### Steam Engine Not Functioning\n- Verify that the steam engine is properly connected to both the boiler and the power network. Ensure that there is a continuous flow of water and steam to the engine, and that it is connected to the power grid with sufficient electric poles.\n\n### Errors with Fueling and Resource Management\n- Make sure that all burner mining drills and furnaces have adequate fuel to operate. Regularly check and refuel these entities to maintain production efficiency.\n\n### Inserter Not Receiving Electricity\n- Confirm that inserters are within the range of powered electric poles. Ensure that the electricity network is active and providing power to all connected entities."}
