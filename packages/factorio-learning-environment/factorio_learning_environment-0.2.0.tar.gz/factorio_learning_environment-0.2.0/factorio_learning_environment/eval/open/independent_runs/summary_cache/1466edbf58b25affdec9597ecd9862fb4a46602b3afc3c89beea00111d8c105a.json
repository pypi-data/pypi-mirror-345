{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-0.5, -9.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position -0.5, -9.5), boiler (position -4.5, 23.0), and offshore pump (position -7.5, 25.5).\n- The steam engine is currently not connected to the power network, resulting in zero energy output.\n- The boiler is functioning at full output with coal as fuel.\n- The offshore pump is operational and supplying water.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 0, 0) and a furnace (position 1, 0).\n- Burner mining drill (position 2, 0) and a furnace (position 3, 0).\n- Burner mining drill (position 4, 0) and a furnace (position 5, 0).\n\n### Copper cable factory at position(2, 2)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine at position(2, 2) and inserter at position(3, 2) that puts into the assembling machine.\n- Beltgroup (position 2, 3) that connects the furnace at position(1, 0) to the assembling machine at position(2, 2).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting steam engine to power pole\n- Ensure that the steam engine is properly connected to a power network. Check the positioning of electric poles to avoid disconnection.\n\n### Errors with boiler and steam engine status\n- Monitor the fuel levels in the boiler to ensure it has enough coal to operate. If the boiler runs out of fuel, the steam engine will not function.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing. Check for existing entities in the intended position."}
