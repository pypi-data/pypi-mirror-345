{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0), currently working with a fuel inventory of coal and processing iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (0.5, -1.5), responsible for moving items into the furnace, currently waiting for space in the destination.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Setup at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0), fueled by coal, extracting iron ore and depositing it into a wooden chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-15.5, -51.5), storing extracted iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -51.5), transferring items from the mining drill to a transport belt.\n\n### Transport Belt System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- BeltGroup connecting positions from (-13.5, -51.5) to (-11.5, -51.5) and from (0.5, -3.5) to (0.5, -1.5), facilitating the movement of items between the mining setup and the furnace.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items without sufficient inventory\n- Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. For example, attempting to insert coal into the furnace failed due to insufficient coal in the inventory.\n\n### Warnings related to full chests and blocked belts\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are full to prevent mining operations from halting.\n- Monitor belt systems for blockages and ensure that there is space in the destination for items being transported.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `insert_item`: Attempts to insert a specified quantity of an item into a target entity. Ensure that the item is available in the inventory before calling this function to avoid errors.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `inventory`: A dictionary tracking current resources such as 'wood', 'coal', 'stone', 'iron-ore', and 'iron-plate'."}
