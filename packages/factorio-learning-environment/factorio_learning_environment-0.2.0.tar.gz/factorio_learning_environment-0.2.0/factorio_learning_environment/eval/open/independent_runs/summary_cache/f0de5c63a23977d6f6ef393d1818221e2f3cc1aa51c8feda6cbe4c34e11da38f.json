{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-15.5, -48.5) and (-14.5, -48.5) for storage.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5) transferring iron ore to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-14.5, -47.5) transferring items between chests and the furnace.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage Area\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-6.5, -49.5), (-6.5, -48.5), (-5.5, -48.5), (-4.5, -48.5), (-3.5, -48.5), (-7.5, -48.5), and (-7.5, -47.5) storing iron plates.\n\n### Additional Stone Furnace at Position (-10.0, -48.0)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-10.0, -48.0) currently not smelting due to lack of ingredients.\n\n### Inserter and Chest Configuration\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-11.5, -46.5) for transferring items between furnaces and chests.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-8.5, -47.5) for transferring items between chests.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Operations\n- Ensure that the inserter's drop position is not blocked. Regularly clear the drop area to prevent blockages.\n\n### Errors with Item Extraction\n- Ensure that the target entity has sufficient items before attempting to extract. Verify the inventory of the entity before extraction.\n\n### Errors with Item Insertion\n- Check that there is available space in the destination entity's inventory before attempting to insert items. Ensure that the source has the necessary items for insertion.\n\n### Fuel Management\n- Monitor and refuel entities like mining drills and inserters to maintain continuous operation. Ensure a steady supply of coal or other fuel types."}
