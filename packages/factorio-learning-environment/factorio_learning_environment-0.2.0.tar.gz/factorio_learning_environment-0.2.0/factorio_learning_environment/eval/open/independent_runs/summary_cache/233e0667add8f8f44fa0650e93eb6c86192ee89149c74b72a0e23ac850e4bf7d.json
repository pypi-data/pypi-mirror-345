{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-16.5, 15.0)\nConsists of:\n- Boiler at position (-16.5, 15.0)\n- Offshore pump at position (-10.5, 25.5)\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors with Inserters and Furnaces\n- Multiple inserters are placed at positions expecting furnaces that are not present. Ensure that furnaces are correctly placed at the expected positions for inserters to function properly.\n  - Affected positions include:\n    - Inserter at x=-16.5 y=-46.5\n    - Inserter at x=-16.5 y=-47.5\n    - Inserter at x=-15.5 y=-46.5\n    - Inserter at x=-14.5 y=-45.5\n    - Inserter at x=-13.5 y=-45.5\n    - Inserter at x=-11.5 y=-45.5\n    - Inserter at x=-10.5 y=-45.5\n    - Inserter at x=-9.5 y=-44.5\n    - Inserter at x=-14.5 y=-43.5\n\n### Errors with Inserters and Sources\n- Inserters are placed without a source to extract from. Ensure that there is a valid source for inserters to extract items.\n  - Affected positions include:\n    - Inserter at x=-16.5 y=-46.5\n    - Inserter at x=-10.5 y=-45.5\n    - Inserter at x=-9.5 y=-44.5\n\n### Pipe Connection Errors\n- Failed to connect pipes between the offshore pump at x=-10.5 y=25.5 and the boiler at x=-16.5 y=15.0. Ensure that the pipes and underground pipes are correctly aligned and connected.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- No utility functions or important variables have been defined or invoked in the provided logs."}
