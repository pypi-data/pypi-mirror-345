{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-20.0, -70.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -70.0) with a status of NO_INGREDIENTS and warnings about the furnace fuel source being full.\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with a status of WORKING, processing copper ore into copper plates.\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (52.5, -84.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) extracting coal, with drop position at (52.5, -84.5).\n- Wooden Chests at positions (52.5, -84.5) and (54.5, -84.5) storing coal.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining Facility at Position (-23.0, -68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) extracting copper ore, with drop position at (23.5, -69.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (-23.5, -69.5) storing copper ore.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Facility at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) extracting iron ore, with drop position at (-14.5, -54.5).\n- Wooden Chests at positions (-14.5, -54.5) and (-12.5, -54.5) storing iron ore.\n\n### Iron Ore and Plate Storage Facility at Position (-16.5, -64.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (-16.5, -64.5) storing iron ore and iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-15.5, -64.5) transferring items between chests.\n\n### Copper Ore Storage Facility at Position (0.5, -4.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Multiple Wooden Chests at positions (0.5, -4.5), (5.5, -4.5), (0.5, -3.5), (0.5, -2.5), (5.5, -3.5), and (5.5, -2.5) storing copper ore.\n\n### Copper Ore Storage Facility at Position (0.5, 3.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Multiple Wooden Chests at positions (0.5, 3.5), (0.5, 2.5), (5.5, 3.5), (5.5, 2.5), (0.5, 4.5), and (5.5, 4.5) storing copper ore.\n\n### Belt Group at Position (1.5, 1.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (1.5, 1.5) to (3.5, 1.5) and (2.5, 1.5) to (4.5, 1.5).\n\n### Belt Group at Position (3.5, 2.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (3.5, 2.5) to (5.5, 2.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### TypeError: 'Chest' object is not callable\n- Ensure that you are using the correct method or function call for interacting with chest objects. Double-check the syntax and ensure that you are not mistakenly treating a chest object as a callable function.\n\n### Inserter drop position mismatch\n- Verify that the inserter drop position matches the intended chest position to ensure proper item transfer. Adjust the inserter position if necessary to align with the chest."}
