Verify the entity type and position before attempting to clear.\n\n### Attribute Errors with 'str' Object\n- Avoid using string objects where an entity object is expected. Ensure that the correct object type is being manipulated in your code.\n\n### Errors with Full Chests\n- Regularly check and clear chests at drop positions to prevent mining drills from stopping due to full chests. Implement a routine to manage inventory in chests effectively.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that source items are available for inserters to pick up. Check the supply chain and ensure that resources are being transported to the inserters efficiently."}
