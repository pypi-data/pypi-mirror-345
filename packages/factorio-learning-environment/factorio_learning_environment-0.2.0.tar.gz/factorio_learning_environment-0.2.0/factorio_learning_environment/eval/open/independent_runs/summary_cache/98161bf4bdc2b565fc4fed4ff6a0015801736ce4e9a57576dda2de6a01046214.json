{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (41.0, -80.0)\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility at Position (-21.0, -73.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-21.0, -73.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -71.0)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Entities Running Out of Fuel\n- Ensure that all entities that require fuel, such as Burner Mining Drills and Stone Furnaces, are regularly refueled to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Errors due to Output Blockage\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity or an appropriate transport mechanism (like belts or inserters) to accept the output from entities such as mining drills. This prevents blockage and ensures smooth operation.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- Inventory: Dict[str, int] - Represents the current inventory of the agent, including items like 'stone-furnace', 'coal', 'stone', 'iron-plate', and 'copper-plate'.\n- Entity Positions: Dict[str, Position] - Represents the positions of various entities on the map, such as mining drills and furnaces."}
