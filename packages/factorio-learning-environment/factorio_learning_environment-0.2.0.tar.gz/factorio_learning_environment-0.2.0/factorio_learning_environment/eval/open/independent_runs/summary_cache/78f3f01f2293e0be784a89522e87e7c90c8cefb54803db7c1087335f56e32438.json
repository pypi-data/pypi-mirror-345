{"content": "# FACTORIO REPORT\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System (x=-9.5, y=1.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump (x=-9.5, y=1.5) - currently working\n- Boiler (x=-5.5, y=4.0) - working with 9 coal remaining\n- Steam engine (x=-0.5, y=7.5) - working and generating power\n- Pipe network connecting these components\n- Small electric pole (x=1.5, y=7.5)\n\nThe system is now operational after coal was added to the boiler in steps 88 and 95. The boiler is converting water to steam, and the steam engine is generating electricity.\n\n### Iron Mining and Smelting Setup (x=18.5, y=73.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill (x=18.5, y=73.5) mining iron ore - currently not working due to full chest\n- Wooden chest (x=18.5, y=75.5) collecting iron ore from the drill (currently contains 800 iron ore)\n- Stone furnace (x=19.0, y=77.0) with 13 coal, currently not working due to no ingredients\n- Inserter (x=19.5, y=78.5) to move iron plates from furnace to chest - waiting for source items\n- Wooden chest (x=19.5, y=79.5) for iron plate storage (currently empty)\n- Chest output inserter (x=19.5, y=80.5) to extract plates from chest - waiting for space in destination\n- Transport belt system starting at (x=19.5, y=81.5) with belts extending to (x=14.5, y=78.5) - currently contains 32 iron plates\n- Additional belt system from (x=8.5, y=75.5) to (x=9.5, y=77.5) connecting to the circuit assembly\n- Small electric poles (x=21.5, y=73.5), (x=20.5, y=75.5), (x=21.5, y=78.5), (x=21.5, y=80.5)\n\nThe system is partially working with the electric components now operational due to power being restored, but the mining drill is not working due to the full chest.\n\n### Copper Mining and Smelting Setup (x=-48.5, y=78.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill (x=-48.5, y=78.5) mining copper ore - currently working but chest is full\n- Wooden chest (x=-48.5, y=80.5) collecting copper ore from the drill (currently contains 799 copper ore)\n- Stone furnace (x=-48.0, y=82.0) with 11 coal, currently not working due to no ingredients\n- Inserter (x=-47.5, y=83.5) to move copper plates from furnace to chest - waiting for source items\n- Wooden chest (x=-47.5, y=84.5) for copper plate storage (currently empty)\n- Chest output inserter (x=-47.5, y=85.5) to extract plates from chest - waiting for space in destination\n- Transport belt system starting at (x=-47.5, y=86.5) extending to (x=-22.5, y=86.5) - currently contains 103 copper plates\n- Small electric poles (x=-45.5, y=78.5), (x=-46.5, y=80.5), (x=-45.5, y=83.5), (x=-45.5, y=85.5)\n\nThe system is partially working with the electric components now operational due to power being restored, but the output belt is blocked.\n\n### Circuit Production System\nConsists of:\n\n#### Copper Cable Assembly (x=-6.5, y=74.5)\n- Assembling machine 2 (x=-6.5, y=74.5) set to produce copper cables - currently has ingredient shortage\n- Input inserter (x=-8.5, y=74.5) to feed copper plates - waiting for source items\n- Output inserter (x=-4.5, y=74.5) to move copper cables to belt - waiting for source items\n- Small electric pole (x=-6.5, y=76.5) providing power"}
