Always ensure the target is a valid inserter that feeds into the SteamEngine rather than the SteamEngine itself.\n\n\u2022 Placement Distance Failures  \n\u2003\u2013 Confirm that the player is within the allowed placement range before attempting to place an entity. Moving closer to the target position will avoid distance-related placement errors.\n\n\u2022 Inventory Shortage Issues  \n\u2003\u2013 Verify that the required item (for example, a wooden chest) is present in the inventory before attempting its placement to prevent errors from insufficient resources.\n\n\u2022 Undefined Variable References  \n\u2003\u2013 Check that all variables (such as target_chest) are correctly declared and referenced to avoid NameError exceptions."}
