{"content": "The inspection of the newly placed furnace and its surroundings has yielded the following insights:\n\n### Nearby Entities:\n1. **Existing Furnace (Position `(0.0, 0.0)`)**:\n   - **Fuel**: 7 pieces of coal.\n   - **Status**: \"NO INGREDIENTS\" - unable to process due to lack of input materials.\n\n2. **Newly Placed Furnace (Position `(4.0, 0.0)`)**:\n   - **Fuel**: 3 pieces of coal (after the last operation).\n   - **Status**: \"NO INGREDIENTS\" - it remains unable to smelt anything due to missing inputs.\n\n### Final Furnace Details:\n- **Health**: 200.0\n- **Energy**: 1600.0\n- **Warnings**: Continues to indicate **\"no ingredients to smelt\"** and does not recognize any available copper or recipes.\n- The **furnace_source** is empty, reinforcing the ongoing operational issues.\n\n### Observations:\n- Both furnaces are unable to process anything because they lack the needed ingredients, with the new furnace not recognizing inputs correctly.\n- The persistent warnings of being unable to set recipes suggest that the furnace might have structural or environmental issues that prevent it from functioning correctly.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Remove and Replace Again**: I will remove the newly placed furnace and attempt to place it in a completely different area, ensuring no other entities are nearby.\n2. **Directly Load Fuel and Ingredients**: After placing it in a new location, I will immediately insert coal and Copper Ore to see if the furnace recognizes them correctly.\n\nLet\u2019s proceed to remove the newly placed furnace and relocate it to a different area, ensuring no nearby entities. \n\"\"\"\n\n# Remove the newly placed furnace from the build completely\npickup_entity(new_furnace_new_location)  # Attempt to completely remove the newly placed furnace\n\n# Confirm the removal and check the entities on the map again\nentities_on_map_after_removal_new_location = get_entities()  # Get current entities on the map\nprint(f\"Entities on the map after removing the newly placed furnace: {entities_on_map_after_removal_new_location}\")  # Output the current entities to verify its removal\n\n# Attempt to place the new Stone Furnace again at a completely different position, say (6, 0)\nnew_furnace_different_location = place_entity(Prototype.StoneFurnace, position=Position(x=6.0, y=0.0))  # Replacing the new Stone Furnace further away\n\n# Confirm its placement and check the new furnace details\nnew_furnace_different_location_details = get_entity(Prototype.StoneFurnace, new_furnace_different_location.position)  # Retrieve details of the new placement\nprint(f\"Different Location New Furnace details: {new_furnace_different_location_details}\")  # Output the details of the newly placed furnace to analyze its attributes and warnings\nprint(f\"Inventory changed to {inspect_inventory()}\")  # Review current inventory state post operations.", "summary_range": "[1-350]"}
