{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (17.5, 20.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (17.5, 20.5) with warnings of 'no input liquid' and 'no fluid present in connections'.\n- Boiler at position (1.5, 23.0) with a warning of 'out of fuel'.\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5) which is currently working.\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and the steam engine, with various pipes positioned at coordinates such as (1.5, 21.5), (-9.5, 23.5), etc.\n- PipeGroup and ElectricityGroup with various entities and positions, ensuring fluid and electrical connections.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting pipes\n- Ensure that the pipes are correctly aligned and connected between the boiler's steam output point and the steam engine's connection points. Verify the positions and ensure there are no gaps in the pipe network.\n\n### Errors due to lack of fuel\n- Regularly check and refuel boilers to prevent them from running out of fuel, which can halt the electricity generation process.\n\n### Errors with steam engine connections\n- Address warnings related to 'no input liquid' and 'no fluid present in connections' by ensuring that the steam engine is properly connected to a source of steam or water. Check the integrity of the pipe connections leading to the steam engine."}
