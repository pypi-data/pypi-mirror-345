{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Steam Engine** at position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\n- **Boiler** at position (x=1.5, y=23.0)\n- **Offshore Pump** at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\n- **Pipe Group** connecting the boiler and steam engine, with pipes at positions including (x=1.5, y=21.5), (x=16.5, y=17.5), and (x=17.5, y=17.5)\n- **Pipe Group** for water transport, starting from offshore pump at position (x=-9.5, y=23.5) and extending through various positions\n- **Electricity Group** with poles at positions such as (x=3.5, y=20.5), (x=14.5, y=20.5), and (x=35.5, y=20.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure that the pipes are correctly aligned and connected between the boiler and steam engine. The error \"Failed to connect {'UndergroundPipe', 'Pipe'} from pipe at x=1.5 y=21.5 to steam-engine at x=17.5 y=20.5\" indicates a misalignment or incorrect connection attempt. Verify the positions and connectivity of pipes before executing the connection command.\n\n### Boiler Out of Fuel\n- Regularly check and refuel the boiler to avoid the \"out of fuel\" warning. Ensure that there is a consistent supply of fuel to maintain the operation of the electricity generator.\n\n### Steam Engine Not Receiving Input Liquid\n- The steam engine has warnings of \"no input liquid\" and \"no fluid present in connections.\" Ensure that the fluid system is properly set up and that water is being transported from the offshore pump to the boiler and then to the steam engine without any blockages or disconnections.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - `connect_entities`: Used to connect entities like pipes and steam engines. Failed due to misalignment or incorrect connection points.\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `pipes`: List of pipe entities used to connect the boiler and steam engine.\n  - `fluid_system`: Represents the fluid network, e.g., `16862` for water transport.\n  - `boiler.steam_output_point`: Position where steam is output from the boiler, used in connection attempts."}
