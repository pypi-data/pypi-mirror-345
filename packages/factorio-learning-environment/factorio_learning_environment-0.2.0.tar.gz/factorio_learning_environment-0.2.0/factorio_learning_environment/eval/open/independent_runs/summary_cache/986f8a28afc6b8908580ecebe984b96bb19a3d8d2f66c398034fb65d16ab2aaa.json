The function takes 3 positional arguments: two positions and a prototype.\n-  Ensure the positions passed to the function are of the correct type. The function expects Position objects, not floats or other types.\n\n### Errors when accessing position attribute\n-  Ensure that the object has a position attribute. In this case, the Position object itself does not have a position attribute.\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n-  Ensure that the tile where the entity is being placed is not occupied by another entity.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n-  No utility functions have been defined by the agent.\n-  Important variables:\n  -  offshore_pump: OffshorePump object\n  -  boiler: Boiler object\n  -  Prototype.Pipe: Prototype object\n  -  Position: Position object"}
