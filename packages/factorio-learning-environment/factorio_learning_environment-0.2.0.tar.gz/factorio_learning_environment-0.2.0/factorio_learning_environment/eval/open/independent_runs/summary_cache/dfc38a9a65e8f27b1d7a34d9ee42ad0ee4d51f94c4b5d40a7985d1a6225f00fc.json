{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo structures have been successfully established on the map. Repeated efforts to craft and place a Lab at (0.5, 2.5) did not result in a completed structure due to missing inventory and resource shortfalls. Although furnaces were referenced and used for smelting operations, they were only retrieved from the environment and not newly constructed by the agent in these steps.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 API Usage Errors \u2013 Incorrect parameters were supplied to get_entities. Remove unsupported keyword arguments (for example, \u201cradius\u201d) or adjust the call to conform to the function\u2019s required positional parameters.\n\u2022 None Handling \u2013 Iteration over a None value (when filtering entities from get_entities) led to a TypeError. Always verify that a valid iterable (or a fallback like an empty list) is returned before attempting to loop over it.\n\u2022 Placement Failures \u2013 Attempts to place a Lab at (0.5, 2.5) failed because the expected Lab item was not present in the inventory. Confirm inventory contents prior to executing placement commands.\n\u2022 Crafting and Resource Shortages \u2013 Multiple lab crafting attempts failed because required sub-ingredients (such as iron\u2010gear\u2010wheels, electronic circuits, and copper cables) were missing. Ensure that all production chains and resource supplies are complete and that intermediate products are available before retrying lab construction."}
