The 'direction' attribute does not exist for BeltGroup. Verify the available attributes and use them correctly.\n\n### Errors with blocked outputs in mining drills\n- Ensure there is a sink entity, such as a chest or a belt, to accept the output from the mining drill to prevent blockage.\n\n### Errors with furnaces having no ingredients to smelt\n- Ensure that furnaces have a consistent supply of raw materials to process, and check that inserters are correctly positioned and operational to supply these materials."}
