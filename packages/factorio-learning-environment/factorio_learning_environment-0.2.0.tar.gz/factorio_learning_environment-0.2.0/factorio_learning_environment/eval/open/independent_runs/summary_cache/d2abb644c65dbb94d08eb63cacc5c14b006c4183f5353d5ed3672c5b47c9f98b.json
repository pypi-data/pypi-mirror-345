{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0) to (-12.0, -48.0)\nThis facility is designed to produce iron plates from iron ore. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and deposits it into a wooden chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore and iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the stone furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0): Processes iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Insufficient Fuel\n- Ensure that all fuel-dependent entities, such as mining drills, inserters, and furnaces, have a sufficient supply of coal. Regularly check and refuel these entities to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Errors Related to Full Inventory\n- Regularly monitor the inventory of chests and furnaces to prevent them from becoming full. Extract items as needed to free up space and ensure continuous production.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Alignment\n- Verify that inserters are correctly aligned to transfer items between entities. Reposition and align inserters as necessary to ensure efficient item transfer.\n\n### Errors Due to Insufficient Inventory Resources\n- Maintain an adequate supply of necessary resources, such as coal, in your inventory to avoid interruptions in refueling operations."}
