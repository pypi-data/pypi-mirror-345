{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5) for coal storage.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Storage Facility at Position (-23.0, -68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-23.5, -69.5) via a transport belt network.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -54.5).\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5) transferring items to a Wooden Chest at position (-12.5, -54.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5) via a Burner Inserter at position (2.5, 0.5).\n\n### Transport Belt Network\n- Multiple BeltGroups connecting various mining drills and chests, facilitating the movement of resources across the map.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Attribute Errors with BeltGroup Objects\n- Ensure that you are accessing attributes that exist on the BeltGroup object. The 'prototype' attribute does not exist on BeltGroup objects. Verify object types before accessing attributes.\n\n### Name Errors with Entity Types\n- Double-check the spelling and case of entity type names. Use the correct class names as defined in the API, such as 'burner_mining_drill' instead of 'BurnerMiningDrill'. Consider using auto-completion features in your IDE to avoid such errors."}
