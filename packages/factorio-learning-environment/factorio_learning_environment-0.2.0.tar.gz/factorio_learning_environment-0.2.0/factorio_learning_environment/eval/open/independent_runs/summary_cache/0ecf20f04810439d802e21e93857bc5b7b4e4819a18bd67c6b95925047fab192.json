{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll generate a report summarizing the structures and providing error tips.\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing System at y=-77.5 to -84.5\nA complex processing system consisting of:\n- Input chest at (46.5, -77.5)\n- Two input burner inserters at:\n  - Left: (46.5, -78.5) facing DOWN\n  - Right: (47.5, -78.5) facing DOWN\n- Belt system:\n  - Left belt at (46.5, -79.5)\n  - Left end belt at (45.5, -79.5)\n  - Right belt at (47.5, -79.5)\n- Two stone furnaces:\n  - Left furnace at (45.0, -81.0) facing UP\n  - Right furnace at (47.0, -81.0) facing UP\n- Two output inserters at:\n  - Left: (45.5, -82.5) facing UP\n  - Right: (47.5, -82.5) facing UP\n- Output wooden chest at (46.5, -83.5)\n\n### Coal Mining Setup\n- Burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0) facing DOWN\n- Two iron chests for coal storage:\n  - At (41.5, -84.5) containing 1600 coal\n  - At (41.5, -83.5) containing 797 coal\n\n### Additional Storage\n- Wooden chest at (49.5, -80.5) containing 800 coal\n- Wooden chest at (49.5, -79.5) containing 50 coal and 1500 iron plates\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Conflicts\n- Before placing transport belts or other entities, check if the target location is clear of other entities\n- When rebuilding systems, consider removing conflicting entities first before placing new ones\n\n### Belt Connection Issues\n- Ensure belt segments are properly connected and aligned before attempting to create corner turns\n- When creating belt paths, build them in sequence from input to output to ensure proper connectivity\n\n### Entity Orientation\n- Pay attention to inserter rotation and pickup/drop positions when placing them\n- Verify furnace orientations match the intended input/output flow\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nFunctions:\n- place_entity(): Places entities on the map. Fails when target location is occupied.\n\nImportant Variables:\n- left_connecting_belt: Transport belt entity\n- right_connecting_belt: Transport belt entity\n- left_input_inserter: Burner inserter entity\n- right_input_inserter: Burner inserter entity"}
