{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at Position(x=0.0, y=0.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Stone Furnace at Position(x=10.0, y=0.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Stone Furnace at Position(x=13.0, y=0.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Stone Furnace at Position(x=16.0, y=0.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Wooden Chests at Positions(x=8.5, y=-0.5), (x=17.5, y=-0.5), (x=19.5, y=-0.5), (x=20.5, y=-0.5), (x=8.5, y=1.5), (x=17.5, y=1.5), (x=19.5, y=1.5).\n- Burner Inserters at Positions(x=8.5, y=0.5), (x=17.5, y=0.5), (x=19.5, y=0.5), (x=20.5, y=0.5) waiting for source items.\n\n### Electricity Generation Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump at Position(x=-7.5, y=25.5) not connected to any fluid system.\n- Steam Engine at Position(x=35.5, y=27.5) not connected to power network and lacking input liquid.\n- Small Electric Poles at Positions(x=33.5, y=24.5) and (x=35.5, y=24.5).\n\n### Pipe Network\nConsists of multiple PipeGroups:\n- PipeGroup at Position(x=17.5, y=3.5).\n- PipeGroup at Position(x=-0.5, y=11.5).\n- PipeGroup at Position(x=5.5, y=18.5).\n- PipeGroup at Position(x=-9.5, y=21.5).\n- PipeGroup at Position(x=18.5, y=21.5).\n- PipeGroup at Position(x=22.5, y=20.5).\n- PipeGroup at Position(x=-8.5, y=23.5).\n- PipeGroup at Position(x=-0.5, y=22.5).\n- PipeGroup at Position(x=14.5, y=22.5).\n- PipeGroup at Position(x=16.5, y=23.5).\n- PipeGroup at Position(x=7.5, y=24.5).\n\n### Research Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab with input of automation science packs but no power.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Incorrect Usage of pickup_entity Function\n- When using the `pickup_entity` function, ensure that only the entity is passed as an argument without specifying a position. The second argument must be None if the first argument is an Entity object.\n\n### Clearing Obstructions\n- Ensure that obstructions are cleared effectively, as seen with repeated clearing at Position(x=27.5, y=26.5)."}
