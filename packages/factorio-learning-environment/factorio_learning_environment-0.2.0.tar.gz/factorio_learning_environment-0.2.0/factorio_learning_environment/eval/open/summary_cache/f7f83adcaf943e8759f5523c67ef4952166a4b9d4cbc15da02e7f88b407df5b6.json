{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron plate mine and smelting setup at position around (16.0, 71.0)\nConsists of the following connected entities forming a mining and smelting structure for iron ore into iron plates:\n- Burner mining drill at position (16.0, 71.0), facing down, extracting iron ore.\n- Stone furnace at position (16.0, 73.0), used to smelt iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden chest at position (17.5, 73.5), collecting iron plates output from the furnace.\n- Burner inserter at position (16.5, 74.5), facing down, moving iron ore from the mining drill to the furnace.\n- Burner inserter at position (18.5, 73.5), facing right, moving iron plates from the furnace to the wooden chest.\n\nThis structure is fueled primarily by coal inserted into the drill, furnace, and inserters to keep them operational. The entities are spatially arranged to enable ore extraction, smelting, and plate collection in a compact area.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter placement conflicts with existing entities\n- When placing inserters next to other entities (e.g., furnace), ensure the target tile is free of other objects such as chests. If placement fails due to occupied tiles, try increasing spacing, changing the inserter\u2019s direction, or adjusting the reference position to avoid overlap.\n\n### Fuel management for burner entities\n- Burner inserters and machines require continuous fuel supply. Errors and warnings indicate inserters and furnaces running out of fuel, causing stoppages. Always verify sufficient coal is inserted into all burner entities to maintain operation.\n- Insert coal into inserters as well as drills and furnaces to prevent fuel starvation.\n\n### Handling item insertion failures due to inventory shortages\n- Attempting to insert items (e.g., coal) into entities from inventory can fail if the inventory lacks the required items. Before insertion, check inventory quantities to avoid exceptions related to missing items.\n\n### Managing entity status and inventory states\n- Entities may show statuses such as NO_INGREDIENTS, NO_FUEL, WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS, or WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION. These indicate missing inputs, fuel, or blocked output paths. Address these by ensuring fuel and input items are present and output inventories or chests have capacity.\n\n### Avoiding output blockage warnings\n- The burner mining drill shows warnings about output being blocked due to no sink entity to accept mined items. Ensure inserters or belts are correctly positioned to pick up outputs from drills to prevent halting production.\n\nNo previous error tips exist to carry forward.\n\n"}
