{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System (incomplete) at (-9.5, -2.5)\n- **Offshore pump** at (-9.5, -2.5) facing RIGHT\n  - Connected to pipe network (fluid system 625) extending to (3.5, -1.5)\n- **Boiler** at (3.5, 0.0) facing UP (contains 48 coal)\n  - Has unconnected input pipe at (3.5, -1.5)\n  - Steam output not connected to steam engine\n- **Steam engine** at (6.5, 0.5) facing UP\n  - Not connected to boiler output\n  - Not connected to power network\n\n### New Power Generation System at (-9.5, 19.5)\n- **Offshore pump** at (-9.5, 19.5) facing RIGHT\n  - Connected to pipe-to-ground at (-8.5, 19.5)\n- **Boiler** at (30.0, 30.5) facing RIGHT\n  - Not connected to water supply\n  - Steam output facing RIGHT towards steam engine\n- **Steam engine** at (33.5, 30.5) facing RIGHT\n  - Not connected to boiler output\n  - Not connected to power network\n\n### Additional Offshore Pump at (-9.5, -0.5)\n- **Offshore pump** at (-9.5, -0.5) facing RIGHT\n  - No connections established\n  - Warning: \"no fluid present in connections\"\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- **Water supply network** (fluid system 625)\n  - Runs from offshore pump through multiple pipes to (3.5, -1.5)\n- **Secondary pipe network** (fluid system 632)\n  - Unused pipes at (1.5, -0.5) and (1.5, 0.5)\n- **New water network** (fluid system 771)\n  - Single pipe-to-ground at (-8.5, 19.5)\n- **Empty pipe networks** (fluid systems 772-773)\n  - Multiple disconnected pipes near (25.5, 20.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Persistent fluid connection issues\n- Repeated attempts to connect empty pipes to boiler (x=30.0, y=30.5)\n  - Verify water reaches connection points before attempting connections\n  - Check fluid system IDs match between components\n  - Ensure offshore pump is properly connected before extending pipe network\n\n### Placement collision errors\n- Multiple failed attempts to place storage tank at (-9.0, 20.0)\n  - Clear existing entities before placement attempts\n  - Verify target location is empty before placement\n- Failed boiler placement at (-9.0, 0.0)\n  - Check for existing entities at target location\n  - Consider alternative placement locations if blocked\n\n### Pipe connection blockages\n- Connection failures due to placement blockages (x=28.0, y=30.5)\n  - Verify clear path exists between connection points\n  - Use underground pipes for longer distances to avoid obstacles\n  - Remove interfering entities before connection attempts\n\n### Repeated error patterns\n- Continuing identical connection attempts without addressing root causes\n  - Analyze error messages thoroughly before retrying\n  - Implement verification steps before connection attempts\n  - Consider alternative approaches when repeated attempts fail\n\n### System isolation problems\n- Creating multiple disconnected power systems\n  - Focus on completing one functional system before expanding\n  - Verify all components are properly connected before moving to new projects\n  - Consider connecting existing systems rather than building new isolated ones\n\n### Fluid type mismatches\n- Attempting connections with empty pipes\n  - Ensure pipes contain the required fluid before connection\n  - Verify fluid types match between source and destination\n  - Check fluid flow direction in the system"}
