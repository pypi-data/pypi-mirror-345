{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5) storing extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5) transferring iron ore from the wooden chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0) intended for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Coal Supply System\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-1.5, 0.5) intended to transfer fuel to the stone furnace.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Inserter Alignment\n- Ensure inserters are correctly aligned with both their pickup and drop positions. Misalignment can prevent the transfer of items between entities.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Ingredients\n- Verify that the inserter is properly set up to transfer iron ore from the chest to the furnace. Check both the inserter's alignment and fuel status.\n\n### Errors in Fuel Supply\n- Maintain an adequate supply of coal in your inventory to refuel mining drills and inserters. Running out of fuel can halt operations.\n\n### Errors in Inventory Management\n- Ensure that there is sufficient coal in your inventory before attempting to insert it into entities like mining drills."}
