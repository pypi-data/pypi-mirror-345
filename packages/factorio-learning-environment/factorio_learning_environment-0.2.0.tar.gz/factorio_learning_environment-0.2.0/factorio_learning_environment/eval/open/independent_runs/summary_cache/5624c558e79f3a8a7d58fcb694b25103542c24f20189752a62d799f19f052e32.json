{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=20.5, y=-4.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=19.5, y=-1.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=20.5, y=-4.0)\n- Steam Engine at position (x=22.5, y=-7.5)\n- Pipe connections linking the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=2.0, y=0.0) for smelting copper ore into copper plates\n- Inserter at position (x=-3.5, y=1.5) for moving items\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-3.5, y=0.5) for storage\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates\n\n### Fluid Systems\n- PipeGroup at position (x=5.5, y=-8.5) with water fluid, connecting various entities\n- PipeGroup at position (x=19.5, y=-2.5) with water fluid, connecting offshore pump to boiler\n\n### Electricity Network\n- ElectricityGroup with poles distributed across positions (x=-3.5, y=3.5) to (x=24.5, y=-7.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Boiler Not Receiving Water\n- Ensure that the boiler is correctly connected to a water source. Check the pipe connections between the offshore pump and the boiler to ensure water can flow.\n\n### Errors with Steam Engine Not Receiving Input Liquid\n- Verify that the steam engine is connected to the boiler with appropriate pipes to ensure steam can be delivered.\n\n### Inserter Not Receiving Electricity\n- Ensure that the inserter is within the range of an electric pole and that the electricity network is powered.\n\n### Boiler and Steam Engine Not Connected\n- Double-check the connections between the boiler and steam engine to ensure they are properly aligned and connected with pipes.\n\n### Furnace Lacking Ingredients\n- Ensure that the furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt by checking the input inventory and supply chain."}
