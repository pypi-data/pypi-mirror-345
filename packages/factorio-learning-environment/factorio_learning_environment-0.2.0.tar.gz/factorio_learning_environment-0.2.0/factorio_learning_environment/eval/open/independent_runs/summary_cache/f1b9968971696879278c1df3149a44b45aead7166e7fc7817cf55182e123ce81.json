{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) supplying iron ore to a wooden chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5).\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-13.0, y=-48.0) processing iron ore into iron plates.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-11.0, y=-48.0) processing iron ore into iron plates.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-9.0, y=-48.0) currently not processing due to lack of ingredients.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-14.5, y=-46.5) waiting for source items.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-14.5, y=-45.5) waiting for source items.\n- Iron Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5) connected to the inserters.\n\n### Coal and Iron Ore Mining Site\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0) supplying coal to a stone furnace at position (x=43.0, y=-82.0).\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=43.0, y=-82.0) processing coal.\n- Iron Chest at position (x=41.5, y=-80.5) storing coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=43.5, y=-80.5) waiting for source items.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=41.5, y=-79.5) currently empty.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source items are available for the inserters to pick up. Check the supply chain to ensure that items are being transported to the inserters.\n\n### Errors with Full Output in Furnaces\n- Regularly empty the furnace output to prevent production halts. Consider using inserters to automate the removal of finished products from furnaces.\n\n### Errors with Mining Drills and Full Chests\n- Monitor the chests connected to mining drills to ensure they are not full. Empty the chests regularly to allow continuous mining operations.\n\n### Errors with Furnaces Lacking Ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces have a continuous supply of raw materials. Check the supply chain and logistics to ensure that raw materials are being delivered to the furnaces efficiently."}
