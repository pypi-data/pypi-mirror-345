{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nThis facility is responsible for extracting and processing iron ore. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at Position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and deposits it into a chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at Position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at Position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at Position (-12.0, -48.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates, but currently not receiving ore due to setup issues.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Inserter Alignment and Functionality\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly positioned and aligned to transfer items from the chest to the furnace. Frequent repositioning indicates potential misalignment.\n- Verify that the inserter is adequately fueled to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Errors in Fuel Management\n- Maintain a sufficient coal supply for refueling inserters and mining drills to prevent operational interruptions.\n\n### Errors in Resource Handling\n- Ensure that the chest is not full to avoid mining drill stoppages. Regularly extract items from the chest to free up space.\n\n### Errors in Crafting\n- Understand that coal is a raw resource that must be gathered, not crafted. Attempting to craft coal will result in an error. Gather coal directly from deposits."}
