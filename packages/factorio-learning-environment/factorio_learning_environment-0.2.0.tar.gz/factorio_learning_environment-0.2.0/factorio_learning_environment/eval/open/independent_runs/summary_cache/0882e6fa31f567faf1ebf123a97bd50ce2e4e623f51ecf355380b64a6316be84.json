{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo new structures have been successfully created on the map. All attempts to place or craft a Lab at position (0.5, 2.5) have ended in errors due to missing inventory items or insufficient resources. Although existing furnaces were referenced\u2014one at Position(x=5.0, y=5.0) for iron smelting and another at Position(x=-27.0, y=-60.0) for copper plate production\u2014these entities were not placed by the agent but simply retrieved for processing. No newly constructed composite structures (with connected components) are present.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 API Call Usage Errors\n  - When invoking get_entities, verify the supported signature. Passing unsupported keyword arguments (such as \u201cradius\u201d) or extra positional arguments leads to type errors. Use only the accepted parameters as defined by the function.\n\n\u2022 Entity Retrieval Validity\n  - Ensure that functions retrieving entities return iterable objects. In cases where get_entities returns None, implement a fallback (for example, an empty list) before attempting to iterate over the results.\n\n\u2022 Lab Placement and Crafting Failures\n  - Confirm that a Lab is available in the inventory before attempting placement. Repeated errors (\u201cNo lab in inventory\u201d) indicate that inventory checks must precede lab placement actions.\n  - When crafting a Lab, all sub-ingredients (such as iron\u2010gear\u2010wheel, electronic\u2010circuit, copper\u2010cable, and copper\u2010plate) must be sufficiently stocked or producible. Double\u2010check the entire resource and production chain to ensure that the requirements for every component are met.\n\n\u2022 Resource Shortage in Recursive Crafting\n  - Even after supplemental smelting steps, the crafting errors (e.g. \u201cstill missing ingredients \u2013 iron-gear-wheel x2\u201d) suggest that resource planning needs revision. Monitor resource counts and production capacities to avoid cascading shortages in multi\u2011step crafting sequences.\n\n"}
