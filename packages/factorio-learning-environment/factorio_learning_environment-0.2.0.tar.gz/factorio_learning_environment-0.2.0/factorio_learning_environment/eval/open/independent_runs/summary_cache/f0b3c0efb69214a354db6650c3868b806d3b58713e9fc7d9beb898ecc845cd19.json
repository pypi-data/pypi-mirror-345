{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at position (-20.0, -70.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (-20.0, -70.0) fueled with coal, processing iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at position (-21.0, -62.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (-21.0, -62.0) fueled with coal, processing iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at position (52.5, -84.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (53.0, -83.0) extracting coal.\n- Wooden chests at positions (52.5, -84.5) and (54.5, -84.5) storing extracted coal.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining Facility at position (-23.0, -68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) extracting copper ore.\n- Wooden chest at position (-23.5, -69.5) storing extracted copper ore.\n- Transport belts connecting the mining drill to the storage chest.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Facility at position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden chest at position (-14.5, -54.5) storing extracted iron ore.\n- Burner inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5) transferring iron ore to another chest at position (-12.5, -54.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Storage Facility at position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Wooden chest at position (1.5, 0.5) storing iron ore and iron plates.\n- Burner inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) waiting for source items.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Empty Source Chests\n- Ensure that source chests are stocked with necessary items to prevent production halts. Regularly check and restock chests as needed.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Verify that inserters have access to source items. If an inserter is waiting, check the connected source chest or belt for availability of items.\n\n### Errors with Furnaces Lacking Ingredients\n- Make sure furnaces have the required ingredients to process. Regularly supply furnaces with necessary raw materials to maintain production efficiency."}
