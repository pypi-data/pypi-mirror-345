{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo new structures have been successfully created by the agent during these steps. Although the agent repeatedly attempted to place a Lab at position (0.5, 2.5), none were actually placed due to resource and inventory shortages. Other operations (such as using furnaces for smelting) referenced existing game entities rather than newly built structures.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 API Call Issues with get_entities  \n\u2003\u2013 When retrieving entities, ensure that the function is invoked according to its correct signature. Avoid using unexpected keyword arguments (e.g. \u201cradius\u201d) or providing positional arguments that do not match the function\u2019s definition.  \n\u2003\u2013 If the call returns None, safeguard the code by converting None to an empty list before attempting any iteration.\n\n\u2022 Lab Crafting and Placement Errors  \n\u2003\u2013 Confirm that the required sub-ingredients (e.g. iron-gear-wheels, electronic circuits, copper cables) and base materials (iron-plate, copper-plate) are available before attempting to craft a Lab.  \n\u2003\u2013 Verify that a Lab is present in the inventory prior to placement to prevent placement errors due to absence of the item."}
