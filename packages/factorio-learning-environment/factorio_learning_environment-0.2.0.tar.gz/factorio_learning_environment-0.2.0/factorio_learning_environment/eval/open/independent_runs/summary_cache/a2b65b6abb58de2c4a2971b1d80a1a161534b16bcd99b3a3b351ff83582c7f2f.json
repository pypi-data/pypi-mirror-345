{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Setup at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0)\n  - Fueled with coal and used for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n  - Current status: No ingredients to smelt, with 62 iron plates in the result.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-1.5, 0.5)\n  - Fueled with coal, used to feed iron ore into the stone furnace.\n  - Current status: Waiting for source items, indicating a lack of input materials.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (2.5, 0.5)\n  - Used for collecting items from the transport belt.\n  - Current status: Normal, inventory is empty.\n- **BeltGroup** connecting the inserter drop position to the storage chest\n  - Consists of belts from (1.5, 2.5) to (1.5, 0.5) in the UP direction and from (1.5, 1.5) to (1.5, -0.5) in the UP direction.\n  - Current status: Empty.\n\n### Transport Belt System\n- **BeltGroup** connecting furnace output to inserter pickup position\n  - Consists of belts from (2.5, 1.5) to (0.5, 1.5) in the LEFT direction and from (-3.5, 0.5) to (-1.5, 0.5) in the RIGHT direction.\n  - Current status: Empty.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Inventory Management\n- Ensure you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to craft or place entities. For example, attempting to place a burner inserter or wooden chest without having them in inventory resulted in errors.\n\n### Errors When Crafting\n- Verify that you have all the required materials before crafting. For instance, attempting to craft a stone furnace without enough stone or a burner inserter without iron gear wheels led to assertion errors.\n- Ensure you have enough wood before crafting a wooden chest to avoid assertion errors.\n\n### Errors When Using Inserters\n- Make sure there is space available at the destination for the inserter to drop items. The inserter was waiting for space in the destination, indicating a blockage that could be resolved by placing a storage chest or another sink object.\n- Ensure the inserter has source items available to pick up, as the inserter was waiting for source items, indicating a lack of input materials.\n\n### Errors When Placing Entities\n- Ensure the target tile is unoccupied and that you have the entity in your inventory before attempting to place it. This was evident when trying to place a wooden chest without having it in inventory.\n- Avoid placing entities where there are existing objects in the way, as this will result in placement errors. For example, attempting to place a transport belt at (1.5, 0.5) failed due to an existing entity at that position. Always remove obstructing entities before placement.\n- Consider increasing spacing or changing direction when placing entities next to others to avoid placement errors due to obstructions, as seen with the burner inserter placement attempts.\n\n### Errors When Picking Up Entities\n- Ensure the entity you are trying to pick up exists at the specified position to avoid errors. For example, attempting to pick up a transport belt at a position where none exists resulted in an error.\n\n### Attribute Errors in Code\n- Verify that you are using the correct attributes for objects. For example, attempting to access a non-existent attribute 'input_position' in a BeltGroup object resulted in an AttributeError.\n- Ensure that objects are properly initialized before accessing their attributes to avoid 'NoneType' object errors.\n\n### Errors When Inspecting Inventories\n- Ensure the entity exists at the specified position when inspecting inventories. For example, attempting to inspect a wooden chest at a position where none exists resulted in an error.\n\n### Errors When Connecting Entities\n- Ensure that the entities you are trying to connect exist and are correctly positioned to avoid connection errors, such as attempting to connect a belt to a non-existent chest position."}
