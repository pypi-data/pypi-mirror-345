{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mine at position(16.0, 71.0)\nConsists of \n- Burner mining drill (position: 16.0, 71.0)\n- Stone furnace (position: 17.0, 74.0)\n- Burner inserter (position: 18.5, 72.5) that outputs iron plates from furnace\n- Belt group (positions: 16.5, 72.5 to 18.5, 73.5) that connects the burner mining drill to the burner inserter\n- Wooden chest (position: 17.5, 77.5) that stores iron plates \n- Wooden chest (position: 18.5, 71.5) that catches iron plates \n\n### Copper Ore Mine at position(-46.5, 70.5)\nConsists of \n- Electric furnace (position: 20.5, 70.5)\n- Boiler (position: 20.5, 68.0)\n- Steam engine (position: 24.5, 68.5)\n\n### Electricity generator \nConsists of \n- Offshore pump (position: -11.5, 69.5)\n- Boiler (position: 20.5, 68.0)\n- Steam engine (position: 24.5, 68.5)\n- Pipe group (positions: -11.5, 68.5 to 18.5, 68.5) that connects the offshore pump to the boiler\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting entities directly\n- Use an inserter or electric poles as an intermediary when connecting entities like steam engines to electric furnaces.\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied positions\n- Check if the target position is occupied by another entity before attempting to place a new entity.\n\n### Errors when using incorrect or missing attributes\n- Ensure that you are accessing valid attributes of an object. For example, 'BeltGroup' object has no attribute 'output_position'.\n\n### Errors when using incorrect or missing arguments\n- Verify that all required arguments are provided and correctly typed when calling a function or method, such as `inspect_inventory` requiring a valid entity.\n\n### Errors when extracting non-existent items from chests or furnaces\n- Ensure that the chest or furnace contains the item you are trying to extract before attempting to extract it.\n\n### Errors due to output being blocked\n- Ensure there is a sink entity in place to accept the output from entities like mining drills.\n\n### Errors when inserters cannot pickup or drop items\n- Ensure that inserters have a clear path to pickup and drop positions and that these positions are not occupied.\n\n### Errors when attempting to insert non-existent items\n- Ensure that you have the item you are trying to insert in your inventory before attempting to insert it into an entity.\n\n### Errors due to unbound local variables\n- Ensure that all variables are properly defined and initialized before using them in your code.\n\n### Errors when attempting to insert items into a full inventory\n- Check if the target inventory is full before attempting to insert items into it.\n\n### Errors when crafting items without required resources or machines\n- Ensure that you have the required resources and machines to craft the desired item.\n\n### Errors when connecting entities with electric poles\n- Ensure that the electric poles are properly placed and connected to the entities.\n\n### Errors when using undefined variables\n- Ensure that all variables are defined before using them in your code.\n\n### Errors when placing entities next to existing entities with insufficient spacing\n- Increase the spacing or change the direction when placing entities next to existing entities.\n\n### Errors when connecting offshore pump to boiler\n- Ensure that there is a valid pipe connection between the offshore pump and the boiler. Make sure none of the source or target connections points are blocked and the target is able to receive the fluid from the source.\n\n### Errors when placing pipe-to-ground on water\n- Ensure that you are not attempting to place a pipe-to-ground on water. Please try a different location.\n\n## NAMESPACE\nNo utility functions have been defined by the agent."}
