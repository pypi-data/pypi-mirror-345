{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron plate production at position(16, 71)\nConsists of following entities\n- Burner mining drill (position (16.0, 71.0)) \n- Stone furnace (position (16.0, 73.0))\n- Burner inserter (position (16.5, 75.5))\n- Burner inserter (position (16.5, 69.5))\n- Wooden chest (position (16.5, 74.5))\n- BeltGroup (positions (16.5, 68.5) to (16.5, 76.5))\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n* Errors when connecting entities directly\n  - Ensure that you are not trying to connect entities directly that do not support direct connection. For example, transport belts cannot be connected directly to a furnace. Instead, use an inserter to input items into the furnace.\n* Errors when placing entities next to each other\n  - Ensure that the space next to the entity you are trying to place another entity is not occupied. Consider increasing the spacing or changing the direction of placement.\n* Errors when accessing non-existent attributes of an entity or a list\n  - Ensure that the attribute you are trying to access exists for the entity or the type of object. For example, 'Furnace' object has certain attributes, 'list' object has no attribute 'status'. Check the entity's or object's documentation to see what attributes are available.\n* Errors when there is no valid path to normalize between entities\n  - Ensure that there is a valid path between entities you are trying to connect. For example, between a burner-mining-drill and a burner-inserter.\n* Errors when furnace result is full\n  - Ensure that the furnace result is extracted before it becomes full to avoid production halt.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\nNo utility functions have been defined by the agent."}
