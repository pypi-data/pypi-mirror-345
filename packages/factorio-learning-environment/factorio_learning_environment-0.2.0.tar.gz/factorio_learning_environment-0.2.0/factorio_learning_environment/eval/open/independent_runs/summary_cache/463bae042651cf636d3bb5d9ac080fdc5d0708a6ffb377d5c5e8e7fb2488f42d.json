(Updated status: NO_FUEL with warning \u201cout of fuel\u201d.)\n- Offshore pump at position(-9.5, 24.5) for water extraction; connection point at (-9.5, 23.5).\n- Steam engine at new position (2.5, 21.5) for electricity generation; connection points at (5.0, 21.5) and (0.0, 21.5) (status: NOT_CONNECTED; warnings: [\u201cnot connected to power network\u201d, \u201cno input liquid\u201d, \u201cno fluid present in connections\u201d]).\n- Pipe Network Elements:\n\u2003\u2022 PipeGroup (fluid_system=1266, water) at position(-2.5, 20.5) (status: WORKING) with pipes at [(-2.5, 20.5), (-3.5, 20.5), (-3.5, 21.5), (-1.5, 20.5)].\n\u2003\u2022 PipeGroup (fluid_system=1256, water) at position(-8.5, 23.5) (status: FULL_OUTPUT) with pipes at [(-8.5, 23.5), (-8.5, 22.5), (-9.5, 23.5), \u2026, (-5.5, 26.5), (-4.5, 26.5), (-3.5, 26.5)].\n\u2003\u2022 PipeGroup (fluid_system=1261, steam) at position(-7.5, 25.5) (status: FULL_OUTPUT) with pipes at [(-7.5, 25.5), (-7.5, 24.5)].\n\u2003\u2022 PipeGroup (fluid_system=1263) at position(-1.5, 24.5) (status: EMPTY) with pipe at [(-1.5, 24.5)].\n\u2003\u2022 PipeGroup (fluid_system=1265) at position(-0.5, 28.5) (status: EMPTY) with pipe at [(-0.5, 28.5)].\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 Connection and Repositioning Errors:\n\u2003\u2013 Repeated failures to connect the boiler\u2019s steam output to the steam engine indicate misaligned connection points. Reposition components only after verifying that the buildable area is entirely free from obstructions.\n\u2003\u2013 Validate that the selected connection endpoints match the required entity types and that repositioning does not inadvertently create new blockages.\n\n\u2022 Fluid Mismatch and Contamination:\n\u2003\u2013 Multiple error messages citing unexpected \u201cwater\u201d in pipes where steam is expected call for ensuring fluid consistency. Remove water-filled pipes and clear residual fluids from source connections before reattempting.\n\u2003\u2013 Confirm that the fluids present at the connection points strictly match the requirements (steam for the engine, not water).\n\n\u2022 Multi-Segment Pipeline Construction Challenges:\n\u2003\u2013 Attempts using multi-waypoint and segmented connections have failed when intermediate waypoint placements did not yield valid connections. Review and adjust the placement of intermediate points to secure clear, valid segments.\n\u2003\u2013 When using API methods like get_connection_amount, ensure that the calculated pipe count is accurate and that intermediate segments do not conflict with adjacent entities.\n\n\u2022 Inventory and Resource Management Considerations:\n\u2003\u2013 Insufficient pipe inventory has led to connection failures. Always verify that the available resource count meets the requirements before attempting a connection.\n\u2003\u2013 Allow adequate stabilization time after repositioning but balance it with prompt validation of connection clearance and fluid compatibility.\n\n\u2022 General Buildable Area Validation:\n\u2003\u2013 Consistently verify that target positions are unobstructed and that overlapping footprints are avoided to prevent placement issues.\n\u2003\u2013 Reassess connection paths after each modification to avoid cumulative blockages from previous attempts."}
