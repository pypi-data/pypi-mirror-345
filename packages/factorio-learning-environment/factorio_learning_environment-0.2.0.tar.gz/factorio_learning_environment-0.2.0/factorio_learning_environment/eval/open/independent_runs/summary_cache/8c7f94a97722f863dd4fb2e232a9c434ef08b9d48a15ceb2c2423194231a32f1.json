{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Fuel: Coal (3 units)\n  - Neighbours: Wooden Chest and Burner Inserter\n  - Drops iron ore into the chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Inventory: 698 units of iron ore\n  - Neighbours: Burner Mining Drill and Burner Inserter\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Status: Waiting for Source Items\n  - Fuel: None (Out of fuel warning)\n  - Pickup Position: (x=-12.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Drop Position: (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Neighbours: Wooden Chest and Burner Mining Drill\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\n  - Status: No Ingredients\n  - Fuel: Coal (9 units)\n  - Furnace Result: 2 iron plates\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Alignment Errors\n- Ensure that the inserter's pickup position aligns with the chest's position. The pickup position should be set to (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) to match the chest's position.\n- Ensure that the inserter's drop position aligns with the furnace's position. The drop position should be set to (x=0.0, y=0.0) to match the furnace's position.\n\n### Fuel Management\n- Regularly check and refuel the burner inserter to prevent it from running out of fuel. This will ensure continuous operation and prevent delays in transferring items.\n\n### Coal Supply Management\n- Monitor coal levels closely and consider mining more coal or redistributing existing coal to maintain the operation of fuel-dependent entities like the burner mining drill and burner inserter."}
