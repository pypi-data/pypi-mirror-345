{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone brick factory at position(0,0)\nConsists of a stone furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with 5 stone-bricks in the output inventory and 16 coal in the fuel inventory. The furnace has been used to smelt stone into stone-bricks and is currently out of ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Stone wall factory at position(5.5, 0.5)\nConsists of an assembling machine at position (5.5, 0.5) with a recipe set to 'stone-wall'. It has no stone-bricks in the input inventory and is not receiving electricity.\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-7.0, -0.5)\nConsists of an offshore pump at position (-9.5, -0.5), a boiler at position (-7.0, -0.5), a steam engine at position (-3.5, 1.5), and a pipe group connecting them. The boiler has 6 coal in the fuel inventory and is producing steam. The offshore pump is working. The steam engine is not connected to the power network and has no input liquid.\n\n### Power network connection\nConsists of a power pole group connecting the steam engine at position (-3.5, 1.5) to the assembling machine at position (5.5, 0.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when attempting to place a pipe at an occupied position\n- Ensure that the target location is clear of other entities before attempting to place a new pipe.\n\n### Errors when steam engine is not connected to power network\n- Ensure that the steam engine is connected to a power network.\n\n### Errors when assembling machine is not receiving electricity\n- Ensure that the assembling machine is connected to a power network.\n\n### Errors when boiler is out of fuel\n- Although the boiler currently has fuel, ensure that it has a sufficient fuel supply to operate.\n\n### Errors when furnace has no ingredients to smelt\n- Ensure that the furnace has the required ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Errors when attempting to craft items without required sub-ingredients\n- Ensure that all required sub-ingredients are available before attempting to craft an item.\n\n### Errors when using entities without power\n- Ensure that entities that require power are connected to a power network.\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied positions\n- Ensure that the target location is clear of other entities before attempting to place a new entity.\n\n### Errors when assembling machine is missing resources\n- Ensure that the assembling machine has the required resources to craft the desired item.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Important Variables\n- `furnace`: Entity, type: stone-furnace\n- `assembling_machine`: Entity, type: assembling-machine-2\n- `boiler`: Entity, type: boiler\n- `offshore_pump`: Entity, type: offshore-pump\n- `steam_engine`: Entity, type: steam-engine\n\n### Utility Functions\nNo utility functions have been defined by the agent in the given logs."}
