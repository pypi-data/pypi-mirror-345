{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=5.5, y=21.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=5.5, y=21.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=-1.5, y=24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting various positions including (x=-9.5, y=23.5), (x=-8.5, y=23.5), (x=-7.5, y=23.5), (x=-6.5, y=23.5), and others\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (x=10.0, y=0.0) with iron-ore input and iron-plate output\n- Furnace at position (x=13.0, y=0.0) with iron-ore input and iron-plate output\n- Furnace at position (x=16.0, y=0.0) with iron-ore input and copper-plate output\n- Burner Inserters at positions (x=8.5, y=0.5), (x=17.5, y=0.5), (x=19.5, y=0.5), and (x=20.5, y=0.5) for transferring materials between furnaces\n\n### Science Lab at Position (x=unknown)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab with input for automation science packs and currently researching logistics\n- Connected to the electricity network via the steam engine\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Pipes\n- Ensure the target tile for placing pipes is unoccupied before attempting to place a pipe. Remove any existing entities at the target position first.\n\n### Errors when Extracting Items from Furnaces\n- Verify that the furnace contains the items you wish to extract before attempting extraction. If the furnace is empty or lacks the specific item, the extraction will fail.\n\n### Errors when Inserting Items into Full Inventories\n- Check the inventory capacity of the target entity before inserting items. If the inventory is full, insertion will not be possible.\n\n### Errors when Refueling with Insufficient Inventory\n- Ensure you have the required fuel in your inventory before attempting to refuel an entity. If the fuel is not available, the refueling action will fail."}
