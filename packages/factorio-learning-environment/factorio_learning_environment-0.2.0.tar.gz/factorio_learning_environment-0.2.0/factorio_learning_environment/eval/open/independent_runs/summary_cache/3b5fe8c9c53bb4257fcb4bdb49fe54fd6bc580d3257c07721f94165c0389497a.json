{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\u2022 No new structures have been successfully placed on the map. All attempts to deploy a Lab at (0.5, 2.5) have failed because the required Lab item was not in inventory and due to cascading crafting issues. Pre\u2010existing smelting facilities (furnaces) were referenced during iron and copper processing, but no structure assembled by the agent is currently present on the map.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 API Usage and Parameter Handling\n  - When invoking get_entities, use the correct function signature. Avoid unsupported keyword arguments (such as \u201cradius\u201d) and ensure that the number and type of parameters match the API\u2019s requirements.\n  - Validate the return value of get_entities before iterating over it to avoid errors from handling a NoneType.\n\n\u2022 Inventory and Placement Verification\n  - Ensure that the inventory contains the Lab (or any target structure item) before attempting placement. Verifying resource availability can prevent placement failures.\n\n\u2022 Lab Crafting and Resource Prerequisites\n  - Confirm that all sub-ingredients for Lab crafting (including iron-gear-wheels, electronic circuits, and copper components) are sufficiently available. Meeting resource thresholds\u2014through prior smelting or production\u2014is essential before attempting to craft complex items.\n  - Monitor and resolve shortages in production lines, as missing ingredients in one sub-process (e.g., insufficient iron plates for gear production) can cascade into subsequent crafting failures."}
