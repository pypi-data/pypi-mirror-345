{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Refueling System\nConsists of:\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-15.5, y=-53.5) connected to a transport belt system.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-52.5) connected to a transport belt system.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-9.5, y=-48.5) connected to a stone furnace.\n\n### Iron Smelting Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-10.0, y=-50.0) with a warning status indicating no ingredients to smelt.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-9.5, y=-48.5) feeding the stone furnace.\n\n### Transport Belt Networks\n- BeltGroup 1: Connects positions (x=-16.5, y=-54.5) to (x=-14.5, y=-54.5) with direction RIGHT.\n- BeltGroup 2: Connects positions (x=-21.5, y=-51.5) to (x=-19.5, y=-51.5) with direction RIGHT, and (x=-15.5, y=-51.5) to (x=-15.5, y=-53.5) with direction UP.\n- BeltGroup 3: Connects positions (x=-14.5, y=-50.5) to (x=-16.5, y=-50.5) with direction LEFT, and (x=-16.5, y=-55.5) to (x=-14.5, y=-55.5) with direction RIGHT.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Transport Belt Connection\n- Ensure that the path for connecting transport belts is valid and that there are no obstacles or incorrect alignments that might prevent successful connection. Verify the start and end positions for compatibility.\n\n### Errors in Placing Wooden Chests\n- Before attempting to place a wooden chest, ensure that the target position is suitable and unoccupied by other entities.\n\n### Furnace Operation Issues\n- Make sure that the stone furnace has the necessary ingredients to smelt. Check the input inventory and supply the required materials to avoid warnings and ensure continuous operation."}
