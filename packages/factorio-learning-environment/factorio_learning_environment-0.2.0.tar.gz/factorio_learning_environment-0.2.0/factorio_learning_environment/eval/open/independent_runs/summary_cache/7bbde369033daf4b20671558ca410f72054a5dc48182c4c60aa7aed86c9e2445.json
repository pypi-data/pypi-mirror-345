{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, y=-48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Three stone furnaces at positions (-15.0, y=-48.0), (-13.0, y=-48.0), and (-11.0, y=-48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates. Each furnace is fueled with coal and currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Iron Ore Storage and Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Iron chest at position (-5.5, y=-50.5) used for storing iron ore and iron plates.\n- Multiple wooden chests at positions ranging from (-14.5, y=-50.5) to (-6.5, y=-50.5) for additional storage of iron plates.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Collection System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (4.0, y=-60.0) extracting iron ore, with a drop position at (4.5, y=-58.5).\n- Wooden chests at positions (4.5, y=-58.5) and (5.5, y=-60.5) for collecting mined iron ore.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors Related to Full Chests\n- Ensure that chests used for collecting resources or storing items have sufficient space. Empty chests regularly to avoid halting production processes.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Ingredients in Furnaces\n- Regularly check and ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to continue smelting operations. This includes maintaining a steady supply of iron ore.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - No utility functions have been defined in the given steps.\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `iron_ore_count: int` - Tracks the amount of iron ore in the inventory.\n  - `iron_plate_count: int` - Tracks the amount of iron plates in the inventory.\n  - `coal_count: int` - Tracks the amount of coal in the inventory.\n\nNo utility functions have been invoked, and no additional information on failure or success modes is available from the logs provided."}
