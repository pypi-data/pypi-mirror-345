{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-0.5, -9.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position -0.5, -9.5), boiler (position -4.5, 24.0), and offshore pump (position -10.5, 25.5). The steam engine is currently not connected to the power network and has no input liquid.\n\n### Lab at position(5.5, -12.5)\nConsists of a lab (position 5.5, -12.5) which is currently not powered and is set to research automation.\n\n### Furnace at position(0, 0)\nConsists of a stone furnace (position 0, 0) which is currently not smelting any ingredients.\n\n### Furnace at position(5, 5)\nConsists of a stone furnace (position 5, 5) which is currently not smelting any ingredients.\n\n### Pipe Groups\nConsists of multiple pipe groups located at various positions:\n- PipeGroup (position -8.5, -6.5)\n- PipeGroup (position -6.5, -7.5)\n- PipeGroup (position -10.5, -4.5)\n- PipeGroup (position -9.5, -5.5)\n- PipeGroup (position -8.5, 21.5) which is currently full of water.\n\n### Electricity Group at position(0.5, -10.080645161290322)\nConsists of several small electric poles located at various positions, including (x=-7.5, y=-11.5), (x=-0.5, y=-11.5), and (x=0.5, y=-11.5). The group is currently not providing power to connected entities.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting entities\n- Ensure that the entity you are trying to connect to is within range and not blocked by other entities. For example, the connection from the small electric pole to the steam engine failed due to placement blockage.\n  \n### Errors when lacking required items\n- Make sure you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to connect entities. The attempt to connect the lab to the steam engine failed because the required item was not available in the inventory.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity in a tile before attempting to place it. This will help avoid placement blockage errors."}
