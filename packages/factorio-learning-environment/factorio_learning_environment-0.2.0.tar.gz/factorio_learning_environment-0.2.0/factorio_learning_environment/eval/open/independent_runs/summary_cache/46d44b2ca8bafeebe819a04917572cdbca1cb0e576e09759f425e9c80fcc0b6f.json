{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-10.5, 25.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore pump at position (-10.5, 25.5)\n- Boiler at position (-14.5, 20.0) and another boiler at position (-11.5, 20.0)\n- Steam engine at position (-4.5, 22.5) and another steam engine at position (-1.5, 22.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pump to the boilers and steam engines\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnaces at positions (-14.0, -49.0) and (-12.0, -48.0)\n- Inserters at positions (-13.5, -47.5), (-14.5, -45.5), (-9.5, -44.5), and (-14.5, -43.5) for moving items between furnaces and chests\n- Wooden chests at positions (-13.5, -46.5) and (-13.5, -44.5)\n- Iron chest at position (-11.5, -44.5)\n- Belt network connecting these entities for efficient item transport\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- Multiple pipe groups are present, with fluid systems identified by IDs 19133, 19134, 19136, 19140, and 19146, indicating various fluid transport systems across the map.\n\n### Electricity Network\n- Electricity group with poles at various positions, including (-9.5, 2.5), (-9.5, 6.5), (-9.5, -33.5), and others, providing power distribution across the map.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Connection Errors with Offshore Pump and Boiler\n- Ensure that the correct type of pipes (both regular and underground) are used and properly aligned to connect the offshore pump to the boiler. Check for any obstructions or misalignments in the pipe network.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Verify that the source items are available and accessible to the inserters. Ensure that the supply chain feeding the inserters is not interrupted and that there are no blockages on the belts.\n\n### Furnace Missing Ingredients\n- Ensure that the necessary raw materials are supplied to the furnaces. Check the supply lines and inserters feeding the furnaces to ensure they are functioning correctly and that there is a steady flow of required resources.\n\n### Steam Engine Reconnection\n- Regularly check the connections between steam engines and the power network. Ensure that all connections are secure and that there are no breaks in the power lines.\n\n### General Tips for Avoiding Errors\n- Regularly inspect and maintain all connections between entities to prevent disconnections.\n- Monitor resource levels and ensure that all production lines have a continuous supply of necessary materials.\n- Use the map view to identify and resolve any bottlenecks or inefficiencies in the production and power networks."}
