{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=5.5, y=21.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=5.5, y=21.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=-1.5, y=24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting the offshore pump to the boiler, with pipes at positions [(x=-8.5, y=23.5), (x=-9.5, y=23.5), (x=-4.5, y=23.5), (x=-3.5, y=23.5), (x=-3.5, y=24.5)]\n- PipeGroup connecting the boiler to the steam engine, with pipes at positions [(x=-0.5, y=22.5), (x=-1.5, y=22.5), (x=1.5, y=22.5), ..., (x=3.5, y=24.5), (x=5.5, y=24.5), (x=4.5, y=24.5)]\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at positions (x=0.0, y=0.0), (x=10.0, y=0.0), (x=13.0, y=0.0), and (x=16.0, y=0.0)\n- Burner Inserters at positions (x=8.5, y=0.5), (x=17.5, y=0.5), (x=19.5, y=0.5), and (x=20.5, y=0.5)\n- Wooden Chests at positions (x=17.5, y=-0.5), (x=19.5, y=-0.5), and (x=20.5, y=-0.5)\n\n### Pipe Infrastructure\n- PipeGroup at position (x=-0.5, y=11.5) with pipes at positions [(x=-0.5, y=11.5), (x=0.5, y=11.5), (x=-0.5, y=13.5), ..., (x=1.5, y=12.5), (x=1.5, y=13.5), (x=2.5, y=13.5)]\n\n### Electrical Network\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at positions [(x=3.5, y=20.5), (x=1.5, y=2.5), (x=1.5, y=10.5), (x=1.5, y=14.5), (x=1.5, y=6.5)]\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Incorrect Class Names\n- Ensure to use the correct class names such as `entities.Furnace` and `entities.Chest` instead of undefined names like `Furnace` or `StoneFurnace`.\n\n### Attribute Errors with Lists\n- Avoid treating lists as objects with attributes. Ensure that the correct object type is being used when accessing attributes.\n\n### Errors in Pipe Connections\n- Verify that all pipe connections are correctly established between entities like offshore pumps and boilers. Ensure that there are no gaps or incorrect pipe types being used.\n\n### Errors When Placing Entities Too Far\n- Move closer to the target position before attempting to place an entity. The maximum distance for placing entities is 10 units.\n\n### Failed Research Initiation\n- Ensure that the necessary conditions and resources are met before attempting to initiate research. Check that the lab has the required science packs and is connected to power.\n\n### Steam Engine Not Working\n- Check the connections and fuel supply to the steam engine. Ensure that the boiler is properly connected and has sufficient fuel to generate steam."}
