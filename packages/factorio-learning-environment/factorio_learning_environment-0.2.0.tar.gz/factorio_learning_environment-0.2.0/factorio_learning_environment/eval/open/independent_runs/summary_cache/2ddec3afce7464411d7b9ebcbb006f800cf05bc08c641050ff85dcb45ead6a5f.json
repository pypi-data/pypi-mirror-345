{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0), currently out of fuel, extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5), serves as a storage for extracted iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=41.0, y=-80.0), fueled with coal, but currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0), currently out of fuel, extracting copper ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-20.0, y=-71.0), fueled with coal, but currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Storage Facility\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=43.5, y=-79.5), serves as a general storage unit.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to insufficient inventory items\n- Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into a machine or structure. For instance, attempting to insert coal into a furnace without having coal in the inventory will result in an error.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `insert_item(item: Prototype, target: Entity, quantity: int)`: This function attempts to insert a specified quantity of an item into a target entity. It can fail if the item is not available in the inventory.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `iron_furnace: Entity` - Represents the iron furnace entity.\n- `copper_furnace: Entity` - Represents the copper furnace entity.\n- `iron_mining_drill: Entity` - Represents the iron mining drill entity.\n- `copper_mining_drill: Entity` - Represents the copper mining drill entity."}
