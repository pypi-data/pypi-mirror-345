{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at position (-20.0, -70.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -70.0) with iron-ore input and iron-plate output.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-17.5, -69.5) storing iron-ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-16.5, -69.5) transferring items between chests and furnace.\n\n### Copper Ore Storage Facility at position (-23.5, -69.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (-23.5, -69.5) storing copper-ore.\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) mining copper-ore and dropping into the chest.\n\n### Coal Mining Facility at position (52.5, -84.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5) storing coal and copper-ore.\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) mining coal and dropping into the chest.\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility at position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with copper-ore input and copper-plate output.\n- Multiple Wooden Chests storing copper-ore around the furnace.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Facility at position (-14.5, -54.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -54.5) storing iron-ore.\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) mining iron-ore and dropping into the chest.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5) transferring items between chests.\n\n### Copper Ore Storage Facility at position (0.5, -4.5) and (5.5, -4.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Multiple Wooden Chests storing copper-ore.\n\n### Belt and Inserter System at position (1.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) transferring items between chests and belts.\n- BeltGroup connecting various chests and furnaces.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source chest or entity has items available for the inserter to pick up. Check the inventories and adjust the supply chain to prevent inserters from idling.\n\n### Furnace with No Ingredients\n- Ensure that the furnace has the necessary ingredients to smelt. Check the input chests and supply lines to maintain a steady flow of raw materials.\n\n### Chest Full Warning\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are full to ensure continuous operation of mining drills and inserters. Consider setting up automated systems to manage inventory overflow.\n\n### Redistributing Resources\n- When redistributing resources, ensure that the target chest has enough space to accommodate the transferred items. This helps in maintaining efficient resource management."}
