{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at Position (-14.5, y=-48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, y=-50.0)\n  - Function: Extracts iron ore and deposits it into the adjacent chest.\n  - Status: Working with coal as fuel.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Function: Stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n  - Current Inventory: 426 units of iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Function: Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n  - Status: Working, but frequently runs out of fuel.\n  - Pickup Position: (-12.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Drop Position: (-14.5, y=-48.5)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, y=0.0)\n  - Function: Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates.\n  - Status: Not receiving iron ore, hence not operational.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Frequent Refueling Required for Inserters\n- Ensure that all inserters have a consistent fuel supply to maintain continuous operation. Automate the refueling process if possible to prevent frequent manual intervention.\n\n### Misalignment of Inserter Setup\n- Verify the alignment and positioning of inserters to ensure they are correctly transferring items between entities. Double-check the pickup and drop positions to avoid operational disruptions.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Ingredients\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly configured and aligned to deliver iron ore to the furnace. Check for any blockages or misconfigurations that prevent the transfer of materials.\n\n### Inserter Running Out of Fuel\n- Monitor inserter fuel levels and refuel them before they run out to prevent interruptions in the production process. Consider using a more efficient fuel source or automating the refueling process."}
