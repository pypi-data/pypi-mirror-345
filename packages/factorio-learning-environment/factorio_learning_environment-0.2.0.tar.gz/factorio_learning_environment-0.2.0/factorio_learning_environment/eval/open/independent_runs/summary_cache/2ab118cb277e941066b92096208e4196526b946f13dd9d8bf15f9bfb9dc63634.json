{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (5.5, 21.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (5.5, 21.5)\n- Boiler at position (-1.5, 24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine\n- Small Electric Pole at position (3.5, 20.5) connecting to the steam engine\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with a warning of 'no ingredients to smelt'\n- Inventory indicates the presence of copper plates in the furnace\n\n### Lab at Position (2.5, 0.5)\n- Lab is actively conducting Automation research\n- Connected to the electricity grid\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Insufficient Resources for Crafting\n- Ensure you have enough materials before attempting to craft items. For example, copper plates and copper cables are often required for crafting other items.\n\n### Connection Failures\n- When connecting pipes or electric poles, ensure you have the required items in your inventory and that the entities are correctly aligned and within range.\n\n### Entity Not Found\n- Verify the existence and correct positioning of entities like labs before attempting operations on them.\n\n### Incorrect Variable Usage\n- Double-check variable names and ensure they are defined before use to avoid NameError exceptions.\n\n### Assertion Failures\n- Ensure that all necessary conditions (e.g., steam engine status) are met before asserting their state to avoid AssertionError.\n\n### Refueling Issues\n- Regularly check and maintain sufficient coal supply to keep boilers operational.\n\n### Lab Status Errors\n- Ensure the lab is correctly placed and connected to the power grid to avoid status errors."}
