For example, attempting to insert coal when none is available in the inventory will result in an error.\n\n### Errors due to full chests\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are full to prevent interruptions in the production process. For instance, the chest at (-14.5, -48.5) needs to be emptied to continue mining operations effectively."}
