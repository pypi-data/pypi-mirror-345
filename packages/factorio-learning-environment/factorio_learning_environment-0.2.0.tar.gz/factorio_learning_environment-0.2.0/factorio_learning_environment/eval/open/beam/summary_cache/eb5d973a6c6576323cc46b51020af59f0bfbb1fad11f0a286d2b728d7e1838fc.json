{"content": "It seems there was a misunderstanding about the structure of the inventory object. Let's correct this by iterating over the specific items we expect in the furnace and clearing them individually.\n\nHere's how you can handle the furnace inventory to ensure it's cleared:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Check and clear the furnace inventory.\nfor item in [Prototype.IronPlate, Prototype.IronOre, Prototype.Coal]:\n    item_count = furnace_inventory.get(item, 0)\n    if item_count > 0:\n        extract_item(item, furnace.position, item_count)\n        print(f\"Extracted {item_count} of {item} from the furnace.\")\n\n# Step 2: Re-check the inventory to confirm it's empty.\nfurnace_inventory = inspect_inventory(furnace)\nif any(furnace_inventory.get(item, 0) > 0 for item in [Prototype.IronPlate, Prototype.IronOre, Prototype.Coal]):\n    raise Exception(\"Furnace wasn't cleared as expected.\")\n\n# Step 3: Insert the required items for smelting.\ninsert_item(Prototype.Coal, furnace, 5)\ninsert_item(Prototype.IronOre, furnace, iron_ore_mined)\n\n# Step 4: Wait for smelting to complete and extract iron plates.\nfor _ in range(30):  # Wait a maximum of 30 seconds\n    iron_plates = inspect_inventory(furnace).get(Prototype.IronPlate, 0)\n    if iron_plates >= needed_iron_plates:\n        extract_item(Prototype.IronPlate, furnace.position, needed_iron_plates)\n        print(f\"Produced {needed_iron_plates} Iron Plates.\")\n        break\n    sleep(1)\nelse:\n    raise Exception(\"Iron smelting timed out. Check furnace fuel or input supply.\")\n\n# Step 5: Craft the pipes using the smelted iron plates.\ncraft_item(Prototype.Pipe, needed_iron_plates)\nprint(f\"Crafted {needed_iron_plates} pipes.\")\n\n# Continue with the remaining steps to connect entities and verify the setup.\n```\n\nThis approach explicitly checks and clears each expected item type from the furnace, ensuring that it is ready for the next operation. Adjust the logic as necessary based on the actual structure of your inventory objects.", "summary_range": "[1-334]"}
