{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Storage System\nConsists of multiple wooden chests for item storage:\n- Wooden chest at position (x=43.5, y=-84.5) containing transport belts, burner inserters, and coal.\n- Wooden chest at position (x=44.5, y=-84.5) containing coal.\n- Wooden chest at position (x=45.5, y=-85.5) containing iron gear wheels.\n- Wooden chest at position (x=46.5, y=-86.5) containing iron gear wheels.\n- Wooden chest at position (x=47.5, y=-87.5) containing coal.\n- Other chests at various positions for temporary storage and redistribution.\n\n### Coal Mining and Distribution System\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0) with a drop position at (x=40.5, y=-83.5).\n- Connected chests for coal storage and distribution at positions (x=40.5, y=-83.5), (x=42.5, y=-84.5), and others.\n\n### Iron Smelting Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=61.0, y=-54.0) supplied with iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=62.5, y=-53.5) for feeding the furnace.\n- Connected chest at position (x=61.5, y=-52.5) for storing smelted products.\n\n### Conveyor Belt Network\nConsists of multiple BeltGroups for item transportation:\n- BeltGroup connecting various positions for efficient item movement across the map.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Full Inventory\n- Ensure that chests have sufficient space before attempting to insert items. Consider using larger chests or redistributing items to prevent overflow.\n\n### Errors in Supplying Ingredients\n- Verify that the necessary ingredients are available in your inventory before attempting to supply them to production facilities.\n\n### Errors with Mining Drill Output\n- Regularly empty chests at the drop position of mining drills to prevent them from becoming full and halting operations.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined by the agent in the provided logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `current_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the current inventory of the agent.\n- `entities_on_map`: List[Entity] - Represents the entities currently placed on the map."}
