{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=-1.5, y=24.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Boiler at position (x=-1.5, y=24.0)\n- Steam engine at position (x=5.5, y=21.5)\n- Offshore pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting offshore pump to boiler with water, starting at position (x=-9.5, y=23.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting boiler to steam engine with steam, starting at position (x=-1.5, y=22.5)\n\n### Stone Furnace at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\n- Stone furnace with coal fuel, status indicating no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Lab\n- Lab with input for automation science pack, currently without power.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Attribute Errors with Boiler Dimensions\n- Ensure that the correct attribute is being accessed for boiler dimensions. The `tile_dimensions` attribute does not exist. Verify the correct attribute name in the API documentation.\n\n### Type Errors with ModelPrivateAttr\n- Avoid using `ModelPrivateAttr` directly in operations. Ensure that attributes are properly converted to compatible types before performing arithmetic operations.\n\n### Connection Failures Due to Missing Items\n- Verify that all required items, such as pipes and small electric poles, are available in inventory before attempting to connect entities. Craft or gather necessary items beforehand.\n\n### Insufficient Resources\n- Ensure sufficient resources are available for crafting and fueling operations. For example, ensure enough coal is available to refuel the boiler and enough materials to craft small electric poles.\n\n### Lab Connection Issues\n- Ensure that the lab is properly connected to the power network. Check that all necessary power poles and connections are in place and that the lab is positioned correctly.\n\n### Steam Engine Connection Failures\n- Ensure that the steam engine is connected to the power network and that all necessary fluid connections are established. Verify that the steam engine has input liquid and that all fluid connections are present and correct."}
