{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Storage and Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest at position (4.5, -56.5) for additional storage.\n- Wooden chest at position (4.5, -58.5) used for transferring iron ore.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Multiple wooden chests at positions (5.5, -60.5), (7.5, -60.5), (6.5, -60.5), (9.5, -60.5), and (8.5, -60.5) storing iron plates.\n- Iron chest at position (-3.5, -52.5) storing iron plates.\n- Wooden chests at positions (-21.5, -54.5), (-20.5, -54.5), (-18.5, -54.5), (-19.5, -54.5), (-11.5, -50.5), (-9.5, -50.5), (-8.5, -50.5), (-7.5, -50.5), and (-6.5, -50.5) storing iron plates.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (4.0, -60.0) with a drop position at (4.5, -58.5), currently out of fuel and unable to continue mining due to a full chest.\n- Stone furnaces at positions (-15.0, -48.0), (-13.0, -48.0), and (-11.0, -48.0), all refueled with coal but lacking ingredients to smelt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Full Chests and Mining Stoppage\n- Ensure that chests at drop positions are emptied regularly to prevent mining drills from halting operations due to full inventories.\n\n### Errors Related to Lack of Smelting Ingredients\n- Ensure that stone furnaces are supplied with the necessary ingredients to continue smelting operations. Regularly check and replenish the furnace source inventory.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `wooden-chest`: int, count of wooden chests in inventory.\n- `wood`: int, count of wood in inventory.\n- `iron-ore`: int, count of iron ore in inventory.\n- `iron-plate`: int, count of iron plates in inventory.\n- `iron-gear-wheel`: int, count of iron gear wheels in inventory."}
