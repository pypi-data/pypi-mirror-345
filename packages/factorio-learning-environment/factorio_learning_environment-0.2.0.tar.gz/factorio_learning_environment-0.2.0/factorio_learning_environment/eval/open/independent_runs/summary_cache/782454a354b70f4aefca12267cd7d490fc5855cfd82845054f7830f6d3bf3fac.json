{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Smelting Setup at position (52.0, -79.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (52.0, -79.0)\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (53.5, -79.5) facing RIGHT, with pickup position at (52.5, -79.5) and drop position at (54.5, -79.5)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (54.5, -79.5) for storing iron plates\n\n#### Coal Mining Setup at position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (41.0, -82.0) facing DOWN\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (41.5, -80.5) for storing coal\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (42.5, -80.5) facing RIGHT, with pickup position at (41.5, -80.5) and drop position at (43.5, -80.5)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (43.5, -80.5) for storing coal\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Incorrect Inserter Positioning\n- Ensure the inserter's pickup and drop positions are correctly aligned with the source and destination entities. Verify the inserter's direction and the positions of the entities it interacts with.\n\n#### Inserter Not Working\n- Check if the inserter has fuel and is correctly positioned to pick up and drop items. Ensure the source entity has items available for pickup.\n\n#### Misaligned Chest Placement\n- When placing a chest to align with an inserter's drop position, ensure the chest is placed in the correct tile to receive items from the inserter.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n#### Utility Functions\n- **rotate_inserter(inserter, direction)**: Rotates the inserter to the specified direction. Ensure the direction aligns with the pickup and drop positions.\n- **place_chest(position)**: Places a chest at the specified position. Ensure the chest is aligned with the inserter's drop position.\n\n#### Important Variables\n- **inserter**: Represents the burner inserter entity, with properties like `pickup_position`, `drop_position`, and `status`.\n- **chest**: Represents the wooden chest entity, with properties like `position` and `inventory`.\n- **furnace**: Represents the stone furnace entity, with properties like `position`, `furnace_source`, and `furnace_result`."}
