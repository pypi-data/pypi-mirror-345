{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) fueled with coal, extracting iron ore and transferring it to a wooden chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) storing iron ore extracted by the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) intended to transfer iron ore from the chest to the stone furnace, but frequently misaligned.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) fueled with coal, intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates, but currently not receiving iron ore due to misalignment issues.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Misalignment of Inserter\n- Ensure the inserter's pickup position is aligned with the chest and the drop position is aligned with the furnace. Frequent repositioning indicates persistent misalignment issues.\n\n### Inserter Out of Fuel\n- Regularly check and refuel the inserter with coal to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Iron Ore\n- Verify the setup of the inserter to ensure it is correctly transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace. Persistent checking indicates a recurring issue with the transfer process.\n\n### Low on Coal\n- Monitor coal levels and consider mining more coal or redistributing existing coal to maintain fuel supply for all entities.\n\n### Insertion Errors Due to Lack of Inventory\n- Ensure there is sufficient coal in the inventory before attempting to refuel entities."}
