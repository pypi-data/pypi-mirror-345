{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone furnace at position (41.0, -80.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position (41.0, -80.0)) that is currently not smelting due to lack of ingredients.\n\n### Stone furnace at position (42.0, -79.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position (42.0, -79.0)) that is currently not smelting due to lack of ingredients.\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position (41.0, -80.0)) and an inserter that puts into the furnace.\n- Assembling machine (not yet placed) that will eventually use copper cables.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items into furnaces\n- Ensure that the furnace is empty or contains the correct type of ore before attempting to insert a different type of ore. For example, a furnace containing copper ore cannot accept iron ore.\n\n### Errors when extracting from furnaces\n- Verify that the furnace contains the item you are trying to extract. For example, if you receive a message stating \"No copper ore in the second furnace to extract,\" it indicates that the furnace is empty or contains a different item.\n\n### Errors when attempting to build structures\n- Ensure you have the required resources in your inventory before attempting to build structures like labs. The error \"Not enough resources to build a lab\" indicates a lack of necessary items.\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Confirm that you have the entity in your inventory before attempting to place it. The error \"Could not place lab at (0.0, 0.0), No lab in inventory\" indicates that the agent attempted to place a lab without having one available.\n\n### Errors related to crafting\n- Ensure that you have the necessary ingredients and machines available for crafting items. The error related to crafting electronic circuits indicates that the required copper plates could not be crafted due to the absence of a crafting machine or furnace."}
