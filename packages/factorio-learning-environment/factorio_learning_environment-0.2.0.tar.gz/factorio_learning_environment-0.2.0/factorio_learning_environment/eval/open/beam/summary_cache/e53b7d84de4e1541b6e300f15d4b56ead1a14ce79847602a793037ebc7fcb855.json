{"content": "# We have successfully crafted 2 Stone Furnaces and still have 50 units of coal in our inventory. \n\nNow, we can proceed to set up our initial smelting operation using the furnaces. Here\u2019s the plan:\n\n1. **Place the Stone Furnaces**: We will place the furnaces in a suitable location.\n2. **Insert Coal into the Furnaces**: We will need to fuel the furnaces with coal to start smelting.\n3. **Set Up Mining**: If we want to smelt ores, we should also set up a mining operation to gather those ores.\n\n### Steps to Follow:\n\n1. **Find a suitable position** to place the furnaces. We can use the nearest buildable function to ensure we have a valid location.\n2. **Place the Stone Furnaces** next to each other for efficient operation.\n3. **Insert Coal into the Furnaces** to fuel them.\n4. **If we have any ores**, we can start smelting them. If not, we should locate and mine some ores.\n\nLet's start by finding a suitable position for the furnaces and placing them. \n\n# 1. Find a valid position to place the first Stone Furnace.\nfurnace_position = nearest_buildable(Prototype.StoneFurnace)\n\n# 2. Place the first Stone Furnace.\nfirst_furnace = place_entity(Prototype.StoneFurnace, position=furnace_position)\n\n# 3. Place the second Stone Furnace next to the first one.\nsecond_furnace = place_entity_next_to(Prototype.StoneFurnace, \n    reference_position=first_furnace.position, \n    direction=Direction.RIGHT)\n\n# 4. Now, let's insert coal into both furnaces.\ninsert_item(Prototype.Coal, first_furnace, quantity=25)  # Insert 25 coal into the first furnace.\ninsert_item(Prototype.Coal, second_furnace, quantity=25)  # Insert 25 coal into the second furnace.\n\n# 5. Check the inventory to confirm the coal has been used.\nprint(f\"Inventory after placing furnaces and inserting coal: {inspect_inventory()}\")", "summary_range": "[1-6]"}
