{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-21.5, 28.0)\nConsists of boiler (position -21.5, 28.0), steam engine (position -11.5, 18.5), and offshore pump (position -9.5, 24.5). The boiler is currently not connected and has no input liquid, while the steam engine also has no input liquid.\n\n### Pipe network\nConsists of multiple pipe groups connecting various entities:\n- PipeGroup (fluid_system=5496) at position (-14.5, 15.5) with status EMPTY.\n- PipeGroup (fluid_system=5503) at position (-9.5, 19.5) with fluid water and status FULL_OUTPUT.\n- PipeGroup (fluid_system=5506) at position (-13.5, 21.5) with status EMPTY.\n- PipeGroup (fluid_system=5510) at position (-11.5, 23.5) with status EMPTY.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 0, 0) and a furnace (position 0, 0).\n- Burner mining drill (position 5, 5) and a furnace (position 5, 5).\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine (position z1) and inserter (position a) that puts into the assembling machine.\n- Beltgroup that connects the furnace at position y1 to the assembling machine at position z1.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting pipes\n- Ensure that the pipes are placed correctly and that there are no obstructions in the path before attempting to connect them. Check the positions of both ends of the pipe connection to ensure they are valid.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors related to boiler connections\n- Verify that the offshore pump is supplying water and that the boiler is positioned correctly to connect with the pipes. Check for any misplaced pipes that may obstruct the connection."}
