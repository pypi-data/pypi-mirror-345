{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES  \n\n#### Coal Mining Operation at (x=16.0, y=0.0) and (x=18.0, y=0.0)  \nConsists of the following entities:  \n- **Burner mining drill** at (x=16.0, y=0.0) with a **wooden chest** at (x=16.5, y=1.5) for coal storage.  \n- **Burner mining drill** at (x=18.0, y=0.0) with a **wooden chest** at (x=18.5, y=1.5) for coal storage.  \n\n#### Coal Collection System  \n- **Main collection chest** at (x=17.5, y=3.5).  \n- **Inserters** at (x=16.5, y=2.5) and (x=18.5, y=2.5) to transfer coal from mining chests.  \n- **Manual transfer inserter** at (x=17.5, y=2.5).  \n\n#### Military Science Production Facility  \n- **Assembling Machine 2** at (x=20.5, y=0.5) for **Piercing Rounds Magazine** (unpowered, missing inputs).  \n- **Assembling Machine 2** at (x=20.5, y=3.5) for **Grenades** (unpowered, missing inputs).  \n- **Assembling Machine 2** at (x=24.5, y=3.5) for **Military Science Packs** (unpowered, missing inputs).  \n- **Assembling Machine 2** at (x=20.5, y=6.5) for **Stone Walls** (unpowered, missing inputs).  \n\n### ERROR TIPS  \n\n#### Placement Distance Errors  \n- **Entities cannot be placed beyond 10 tiles from the player**  \n  - Move closer to the target position before placing (e.g., (30.0, 0.0), (20.0, 0.0)).  \n\n#### Collision and Terrain Issues  \n- **Entities cannot be placed on occupied tiles or water**  \n  - Clear existing entities (e.g., (30.5, 0.5)) or avoid unplaceable terrain (e.g., (34.0, 4.0)).  \n\n#### Power Network Errors  \n- **Assemblers require power connections**  \n  - Place **small electric poles** near assemblers (e.g., (31.5, 0.0) blocked).  \n  - Ensure poles are within reach of machines and each other.  \n\n#### Inconsistent Variable Definitions  \n- **Undefined variables in production line setup**  \n  - Define all required variables (e.g., `piercing_cell`) before use.  \n\n#### General Tips  \n- **Verify terrain and entity collisions** before placement.  \n- **Pre-plan power networks** to avoid unpowered assemblers.  \n- **Check resource availability** for recipes (e.g., missing copper plates, steel plates).  \n\n### NAMESPACE  \n\n#### Functions  \n- **`create_assembler_cell(position: Position, recipe: Prototype) -> tuple`**  \n  - Attempts to place an assembler and supporting infrastructure for a given recipe.  \n  - **Failures**: Distance, collisions, or missing power poles.  \n\n- **`create_simple_assembler(x: int, y: int, recipe: Prototype) -> Entity`**  \n  - Places an assembler with inserters at specified coordinates.  \n  - **Failures**: Terrain/entity collisions (e.g., (19.0, 0.0)).  \n\n#### Variables  \n- **`piercing_cell`**: Intended for Piercing Rounds Magazine production (undefined in some steps).  \n- **`science_cell`**: Intended for Military Science Pack production (undefined in some steps)."}
