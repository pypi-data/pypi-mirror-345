{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-11.5, 18.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position -11.5, 18.5), boiler (position -21.5, 28.0), and offshore pump (position -9.5, 24.5). The steam engine is currently not connected due to the boiler's status of NOT_CONNECTED.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 0.0, 0.0) and a furnace (position 0.0, 0.0)\n- Burner mining drill (position 5.0, 5.0) and a furnace (position 5.0, 5.0)\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 0.0, 0.0) and a furnace (position 0.0, 0.0)\n- Assembling machine at position (z1) and inserter at position (a) that puts into the assembling machine\n- Beltgroup (position) that connects the furnace at position (y1) to the assembling machine at position (z1)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with boiler connection\n- Ensure that the pipe is correctly placed and connected to both the offshore pump and the boiler. The current boiler status indicates it is NOT_CONNECTED due to improper piping.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place. \n\n### General connection errors\n- Check the connection points of entities to ensure they are properly linked, especially for fluid systems."}
