{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=10.5, y=34.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=10.5, y=34.5) with status NOT_CONNECTED and no energy.\n- Boiler at position (x=5.5, y=27.0) with status NOT_CONNECTED, fueled by coal.\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-7.5, y=25.5) and another at position (x=0.5, y=30.5), both with status WORKING, providing water to the system.\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pumps to the boiler and steam engine, with multiple pipe groups at various positions.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=15.0, y=0.0) with status NO_INGREDIENTS, producing iron plates.\n- Inserters at positions (x=17.5, y=0.5) and (x=16.5, y=0.5), both with status NO_POWER, intended to move items between chests and the furnace.\n- Wooden Chests at positions (x=5.5, y=0.5) and (x=18.5, y=0.5) for storage.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Boiler and Steam Engine Not Connected\n- Ensure that the boiler and steam engine are properly connected to the fluid network and have access to water. Check pipe connections and ensure there are no gaps or misalignments.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Not Receiving Power\n- Make sure inserters are connected to a power network. Verify that there are electric poles nearby and that they are connected to the power grid.\n\n### Errors with Steam Engine Not Producing Energy\n- Confirm that the steam engine is connected to both the boiler and the electricity network. Ensure that the boiler is receiving water and is fueled to produce steam.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Not Having Ingredients\n- Ensure that the furnace has the necessary raw materials to smelt. Check the inserters and belts feeding the furnace to confirm they are functioning and delivering materials."}
