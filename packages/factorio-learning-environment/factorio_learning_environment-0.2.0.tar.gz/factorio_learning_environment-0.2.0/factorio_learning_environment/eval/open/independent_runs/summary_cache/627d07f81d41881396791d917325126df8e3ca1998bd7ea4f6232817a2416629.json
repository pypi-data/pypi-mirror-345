Use the `find_buildable_area` function to locate valid positions.\n\n#### Errors due to undefined variables\n- The variable `chest` was referenced but not defined. Ensure all variables are properly initialized before use. For example, use `coal_chest` or `chest_pos` instead of `chest`.\n\n#### Errors when moving to a new area\n- The `move_to` function failed because the position argument was incorrectly formatted. Ensure the position argument is a valid `Position` object with integer indices, not strings.\n\n#### Repeated placement attempts in invalid positions\n- Avoid repeatedly attempting to place entities in the same invalid positions. Check for buildability once and move to a valid area if necessary.\n\n#### Errors when extracting or inserting items\n- Ensure the target entity (e.g., chest or mining drill) is within reach and has sufficient space or fuel before attempting to extract or insert items."}
