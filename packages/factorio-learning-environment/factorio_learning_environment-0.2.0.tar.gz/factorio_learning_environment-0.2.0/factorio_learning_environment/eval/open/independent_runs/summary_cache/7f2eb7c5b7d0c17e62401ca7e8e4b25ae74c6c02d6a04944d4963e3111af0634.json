For example, crafting Underground Pipes requires sufficient iron plates.\n- Regularly update and check your inventory to avoid running out of essential items like pipes or iron plates.\n\n### Errors in Entity Placement\n- Avoid placing entities like pipes or steam engines in locations where the terrain is unplaceable, such as over water or where another object is in the way.\n- Verify that the target location is clear and suitable for placing the entity to prevent placement errors.\n\n### Connection Errors in Power Systems\n- Ensure that all components of the electricity generator, such as boilers and steam engines, are properly connected to each other and to the electric network.\n- Check the connections between the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine to ensure a complete power generation setup.\n\n### Errors in Code and Logic\n- Address any assertion errors or exceptions in your code logic, such as ensuring that there is iron ore available before attempting to smelt.\n- Correct any attribute errors in your code, such as using the correct attribute names for prototypes or entities."}
