{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Factory at position (0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Furnace at position (2.0, 0.0)\n- Furnace at position (4.0, 0.0)\n- Furnace at position (6.0, 0.0)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items into furnaces\n- Ensure that the furnace has available space in its inventory before attempting to insert items. If the inventory is full, the insertion will fail.\n- Check the inventory of the furnace before inserting items to avoid repeated errors.\n\n### Errors when not having enough resources\n- Always monitor your inventory levels to ensure you have enough resources (like iron ore and coal) before attempting to insert them into furnaces. This will prevent errors related to insufficient resources.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items."}
