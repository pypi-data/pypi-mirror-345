{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with a status of FULL_OUTPUT, currently holding 100 iron plates.\n- Furnace at position (2.0, 0.0) with a status of FULL_OUTPUT, currently holding 100 iron plates.\n\n### Coal Mining and Distribution System at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) with status NO_FUEL, connected to:\n  - Burner Inserter at position (41.5, -83.5) with status WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS, transferring items to:\n  - Wooden Chest at position (42.5, -83.5) containing 43 units of coal.\n- Additional Burner Inserter at position (41.5, -80.5) with status WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS, transferring items to:\n  - Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -79.5) containing 754 units of coal.\n- BeltGroup connecting the chests and moving coal from position (42.5, -83.5) to (45.5, -83.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Fuel Management\n- Ensure that all burner mining drills and furnaces are adequately refueled to maintain continuous operation. Regularly check fuel levels and replenish as necessary.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Verify that the source items are available for inserters to pick up. Ensure that the mining drills are operational and producing resources for inserters to transfer.\n\n### Furnace Output Management\n- Monitor the output inventory of furnaces to prevent them from becoming full. Regularly transfer the produced items to storage or further processing to maintain production efficiency."}
