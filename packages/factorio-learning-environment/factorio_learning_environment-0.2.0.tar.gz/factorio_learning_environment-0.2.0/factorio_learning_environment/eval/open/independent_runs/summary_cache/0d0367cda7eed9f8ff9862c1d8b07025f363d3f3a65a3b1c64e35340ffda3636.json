{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-14.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -48.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-14.5, -46.5) transferring iron ore from the mining drill to the furnace.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-12.5, -47.5) transferring iron plates from the furnace to a wooden chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-11.5, -47.5) storing iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Misalignment Issues with Inserters\n- Ensure that the inserter's pickup and drop positions align correctly with the source and destination entities to avoid misalignment errors.\n\n### Errors When Placing Entities on Occupied Tiles\n- Before placing an entity, verify that the target tile is unoccupied to prevent placement errors. Consider adjusting the spacing, direction, or reference position if necessary.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entity is producing or has items available for the inserter to pick up to prevent it from waiting for source items.\n\n### Fuel Management\n- Regularly refuel entities such as mining drills, furnaces, and inserters to maintain continuous operation and avoid stoppages due to lack of fuel."}
