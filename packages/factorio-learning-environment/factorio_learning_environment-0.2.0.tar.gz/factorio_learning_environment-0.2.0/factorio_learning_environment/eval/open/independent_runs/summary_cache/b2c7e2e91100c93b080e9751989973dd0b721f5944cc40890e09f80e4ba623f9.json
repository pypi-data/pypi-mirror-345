{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-9.5, 24.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, 24.5) [Status: WORKING]\n- Steam engine at position (-5.5, 19.5) [Status: NOT_CONNECTED]\n- Boiler at position (-2.5, 24.0) [Status: NOT_CONNECTED]\n- Pipe groups connecting various components:\n  - Pipe group at position (-4.5, 16.5) [Status: EMPTY]\n  - Pipe group at position (-9.5, 23.5) [Status: FULL_OUTPUT]\n  - Pipe group at position (-7.5, 24.5) [Status: EMPTY]\n  - Pipe group at position (-5.5, 24.5) [Status: EMPTY]\n\n### Stone Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Stone furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) [Status: NO_INGREDIENTS or WORKING depending on the step]\n\n### Electricity Group\n- Electricity group at position (-3.6666666666666665, 20.214285714285715) [Status: NOT_PLUGGED_IN_ELECTRIC_NETWORK]\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors When Placing Pipes Overlapping with Water\n- Ensure the target tile is not water-occupied before placing pipes or pipe-to-ground. Consider repositioning the pipes to avoid water tiles.\n\n### Errors Due to Missing Inventory Items\n- Verify that the required items (e.g., pipes, pipe-to-ground) are available in the inventory before attempting to place them.\n\n### Incorrect Attribute Usage in Code\n- Correct the attribute usage in code, such as replacing 'PipeToGround' with 'PipeGroup' if applicable.\n\n### Errors Due to No Ingredients in Stone Furnace\n- Ensure that the stone furnace has the necessary ingredients to operate. Check inventory for required items and supply them to the furnace.\n\n### Errors in Crafting Due to Missing Ingredients\n- Check the inventory for required ingredients before crafting. Ensure that all necessary materials are available.\n\n### Errors in Using API with Incorrect Data Types\n- Ensure that the correct data types are used in API calls, such as converting data to the appropriate type before use.\n\n### Assertion Errors Due to Lack of Resources\n- Ensure that resources like iron ore are available before attempting operations that require them, such as smelting."}
