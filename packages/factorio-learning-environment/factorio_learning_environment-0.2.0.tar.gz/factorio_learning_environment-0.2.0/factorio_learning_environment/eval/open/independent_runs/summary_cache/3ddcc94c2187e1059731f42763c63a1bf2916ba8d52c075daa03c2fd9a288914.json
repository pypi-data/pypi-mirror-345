{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-9.5, 24.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (-1.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe Group connecting the Offshore Pump, Boiler, and Steam Engine\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (6.0, -62.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0)\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) connected to the furnace\n- Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5) for storage\n\n### Research Lab at Position (6.5, -59.5)\nConsists of:\n- Lab with input for automation science packs\n- Wooden Chest at Position (6.5, -59.5) for storing research materials\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of:\n- Small Electric Poles at various positions including (5.5, -60.5), (7.5, -59.5), and others, forming an electricity group\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Incorrect Argument Count in Function Call\n- Ensure that the `nearest` function is called with the correct number of arguments. The function requires only two arguments.\n\n### Insufficient Inventory for Connection\n- Before attempting to connect entities using electric poles, verify that you have the required items in your inventory to complete the connection.\n\n### Inserter Not Receiving Power\n- Ensure that inserters are correctly connected to a power source. Check that the small electric poles are properly placed and connected to provide power to the inserters.\n\n### Boiler Out of Fuel\n- Regularly check the fuel levels in boilers to ensure continuous operation. Refill them with the appropriate fuel when necessary.\n\n### Steam Engine Not Connected\n- Verify that the steam engine is properly connected to the boiler and that there is a continuous flow of steam. Check the pipe connections and ensure there are no gaps."}
