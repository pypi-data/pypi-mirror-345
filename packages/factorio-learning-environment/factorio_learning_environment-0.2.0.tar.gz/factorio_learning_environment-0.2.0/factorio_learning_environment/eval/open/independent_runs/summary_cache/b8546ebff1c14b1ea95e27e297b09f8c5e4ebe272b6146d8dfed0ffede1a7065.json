{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Smelting Facility at Position (-10.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-10.0, -50.0)\n- Burner Inserter at position (-9.5, -48.5) that feeds the furnace\n\n### Coal Refueling System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Inserter at position (-15.5, -53.5) with coal in its inventory\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -52.5) with coal in its inventory\n- Burner Inserter at position (-9.5, -48.5) with coal in its inventory\n\n### Transport Belt Network\nConsists of the following entities:\n- BeltGroup with belts from position (x=-16.5, y=-54.5) to (x=-14.5, y=-54.5)\n- BeltGroup with belts from position (x=-14.5, y=-50.5) to (x=-16.5, y=-50.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Extracting Items from Furnace\n- Ensure that the furnace contains the items you wish to extract before attempting extraction. Verify that the furnace has both fuel and input materials.\n\n### Errors when Connecting Belts to Furnace\n- Belts cannot be directly connected to a furnace. Use an inserter to transfer items between belts and furnaces.\n\n### Errors when Finding Suitable Position for Burner Inserter\n- Ensure there is enough space and no obstructions at the intended position before placing a burner inserter.\n\n### Errors due to Missing Attributes in Code\n- Double-check the attributes of objects in your code. Ensure that you are using the correct attribute names and that the objects have the attributes you are trying to access.\n\n### Errors when Crafting Items without Required Ingredients\n- Ensure all required ingredients are available before attempting to craft an item. For example, iron plates must be smelted in a furnace before they can be used in crafting."}
