{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report - Steps 0-79\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Steam Power Generation at (x=-9.5, y=-0.5) to (x=0.5, y=8.5)\nGenerates electricity using steam power. The boiler was refueled in Step 75. Power is currently active (Steam Engine status: WORKING in Step 79 log).\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at (x=-9.5, y=-0.5)\n- Boiler at (x=-5.0, y=2.5) (Fueled with coal)\n- Steam Engine at (x=0.5, y=6.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting pump to boiler (fluid_system=12653, starting at x=-8.5, y=-0.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting boiler to steam engine (fluid_system=12655, starting at x=-3.5, y=3.5)\n\n### Coal Mining and Chest Storage at (x=29.5, y=18.5) to (x=30.5, y=20.5)\nMines coal and stores it in a wooden chest. An inserter moves coal from the drill's output position to the chest.\nConsists of:\n- Electric Mining Drill at (x=29.5, y=18.5) (Mining coal)\n- Wooden Chest at (x=29.5, y=20.5) (Storing coal)\n- Inserter at (x=30.5, y=20.5) (Moves coal from drill output to chest, currently blocked)\n\n### Crude Oil Extraction and Refining at (x=17.5, y=40.5) to (x=40.5, y=66.5)\nExtracts crude oil, transports it via pipes, stores it temporarily, refines it into petroleum gas, and stores the gas.\nConsists of:\n- PumpJack at (x=17.5, y=40.5) (Extracting crude oil)\n- StorageTank at (x=25.5, y=43.5) (Storing crude oil)\n- Oil Refinery at (x=30.5, y=63.5) (Processing crude oil into petroleum gas)\n- StorageTank at (x=40.5, y=66.5) (Storing petroleum gas)\n- PipeGroup"}
