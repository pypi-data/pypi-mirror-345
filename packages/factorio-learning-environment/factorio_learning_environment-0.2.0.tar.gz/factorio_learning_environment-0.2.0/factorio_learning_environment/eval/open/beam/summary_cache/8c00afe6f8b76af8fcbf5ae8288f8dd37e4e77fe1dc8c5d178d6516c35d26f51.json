This means that the smelting process for copper plates has begun successfully!\n\n### Current Inventory:\n- 3 pieces of stone furnaces\n- 16 pieces of wood\n- 5 pieces of coal (used for refueling)\n- 5 pieces of stone\n- 10 pieces of iron ore\n- 5 pieces of copper ore (currently being smelted)\n- 3 pieces of iron plates\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Monitor the Smelting Process**: I should keep an eye on the furnace to ensure it completes the smelting of copper ore into copper plates.\n2. **Prepare for Iron Ore Processing**: Once the copper plates are produced, I can shift focus to smelting iron ore into iron plates, which are also critical for further automation and crafting.\n3. **Consider Research Options**: With the copper plates produced, I can begin planning for research activities that require these items.\n\nLet\u2019s monitor the furnace until it completes the smelting process for the copper ore.
