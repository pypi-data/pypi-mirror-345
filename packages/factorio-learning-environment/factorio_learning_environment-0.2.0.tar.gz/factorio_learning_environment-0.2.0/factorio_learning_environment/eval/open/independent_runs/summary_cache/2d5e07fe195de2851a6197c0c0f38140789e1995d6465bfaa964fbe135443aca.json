{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (46.0, -82.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace at position (46.0, -82.0) that processes both iron ore into iron plates and copper ore into copper plates.\n- Wooden chest at position (47.5, -81.5) that collects the processed outputs.\nUpdates:\n- Steps 38\u201347 to 62: Managed and processed iron ore into iron plates with periodic inventory updates and experienced timeout delays.\n- Steps 64\u201365: An attempt to set up a dedicated copper smelting was made at (\u201328.5, \u201361.5) but failed due to insufficient inventory; the existing furnace was employed for copper ore insertion, although an entity reference error occurred.\n- Steps 66\u201367: Achieved copper ore insertion and subsequent production of copper plates and conversion into copper cables.\n  \n(All previous structure details remain unchanged as no new structure was successfully added in the current steps.)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement and Tile Occupation\n- When placing entities adjacent to existing structures, verify the target tile is unoccupied. Before inserting a burner inserter adjacent to the stone furnace at (46.0, -82.0), check that supportive entities (e.g., wooden chest at (47.5, -81.5) or nearby positions) do not block placement. Consider increasing spacing, altering direction, or adjusting reference positions.\n\n### Inventory and API Argument Management\n- Continue verifying the availability of required items in inventory before commencing placement operations.\n- Provide appropriate entity references instead of using positions alone to avoid argument type errors during insertion.\n\n### Timeout, Waiting Cycle, and Stale Data Management\n- Maintain careful monitoring of processing progress, ensuring fuel and ingredient levels are adequate to avoid future delays.\n- Refresh entity data post-inventory updates to base decisions on current state information.\n\n(Previous error resolution tips are maintained with the new addition addressing placement conflicts.)"}
