{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -49.0) used for smelting iron ore into iron plates. Current status is NO_INGREDIENTS, with a fuel inventory of coal and an iron plate output of 73.\n\n### Coal Mining and Transport System at Position (42.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (42.0, -83.0) extracting coal. It is currently working but has a warning indicating the output is blocked by an item on the ground.\n- Burner Inserter at position (42.5, -81.5) with a status of WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS, indicating it is ready to transfer items but is waiting for source items. It has a warning that the chest is full.\n- BeltGroup consisting of transport belts connecting the mining drill to other parts of the system. The belts run from (42.5, -82.5) to (44.5, -82.5) in a RIGHT direction and from (43.5, -81.5) to (43.5, -79.5) in a DOWN direction, with an output belt running from (43.5, -80.5) to (42.5, -79.5) in a LEFT direction.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing Wooden Chest\n- Ensure that the intended position for placing a Wooden Chest is unoccupied by other entities or obstructions before attempting to place it.\n\n### Errors when extending or reconnecting Transport Belts\n- Verify that the path for extending or reconnecting transport belts is clear and that there are no obstructions or misalignments that could prevent successful placement.\n\n### Errors due to output blockage\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity or clear path for the output of the Burner Mining Drill to prevent blockage.\n\n### Errors due to full inventory\n- Regularly check and manage the inventory of entities like the Burner Inserter to prevent them from becoming full and halting operations."}
