{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=20.5, y=-4.0)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (x=22.5, y=-7.5)\n- Boiler at Position (x=20.5, y=-4.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (x=19.5, y=-1.5)\n- Connected via a series of pipes and small electric poles for power distribution\n\n### Copper Cable Factory at Position (x=10.5, y=0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling Machine at Position (x=10.5, y=0.5)\n- Inserter at Position (x=9.5, y=5.5) that inputs into the assembling machine\n- BeltGroup connecting the furnace at Position (x=5.0, y=5.0) to the assembling machine at Position (x=10.5, y=0.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Furnace at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\n- Furnace at Position (x=2.0, y=0.0)\n- Inserter at Position (x=-3.5, y=1.5) for transferring items\n- Wooden Chests at Positions (x=-3.5, y=0.5) and (x=-3.5, y=2.5) for storage\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Site at Position (x=-11.0, y=20.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (x=-11.0, y=20.0)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (x=-11.5, y=18.5) for storing mined iron ore\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Assembling Machine Not Producing Copper Cables\n- Ensure that the assembling machine has all necessary ingredients, specifically copper plates, to produce copper cables. Check the supply chain for any blockages or shortages.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Verify that the inserters have access to the required source items. Ensure that the input chests or belts are adequately stocked with the necessary materials.\n\n### Furnace No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Make sure that the furnaces have the required raw materials to smelt. Check the supply lines and ensure that the input chests or belts are delivering the necessary resources.\n\n### Errors When Using Extracting but Being Too Far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors When Placing into a Tile Which is Occupied by Another Entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
