{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n###Iron Smelting Area (x=0-6, y=0-4)\nConsists of multiple furnaces for smelting iron:\n- Stone furnace at position(0,0)\n- Stone furnace at position(2,0)\n- Stone furnace at position(4,4)\n- Stone furnace at position(6,4)\n\n###Inserter Production Line (x=20-27, y=2.5)\nAssembly line for creating inserters:\n- Input chest at position(20.5,2.5) containing 175 inserters\n- Burner inserter at position(21.5,2.5) with 4 coal as fuel\n- Assembling machine 1 at position(23.5,2.5)\n- Burner inserter at position(25.5,2.5) with 19 coal as fuel\n- Output chest at position(26.5,2.5)\n\n###Power Generation System (x=-9.5 to 6.5, y=21.5-27)\nComplete power generation setup:\n- Offshore pump at position(-9.5,24.5) producing water\n- Pipe network connecting water from pump to boiler\n- Boiler at position(-2.5,24) converting water to steam\n- Steam pipe network connecting boiler to engine\n- Steam engine at position(4.5,24.5) generating electricity\n- Small electric poles at positions(2.5,24.5) and (6.5,24.5) distributing power\n\n###Research Lab Network\nMultiple labs connected to electricity network (id=70956):\n- Several labs with automation science packs (12-74 packs)\n- Some labs with logistic science packs (14-40 packs)\n- Multiple unpowered labs\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Issues with inventory management\n- Always check if required items are in inventory before attempting to insert them into machines\n- Keep track of fuel (coal) levels for burner inserters and boilers\n\n### Assembly line resource shortages\n- Ensure all required components (iron plate, iron gear wheel, electronic circuit) are available before starting assembly\n- Monitor input chest inventory to maintain continuous production\n\n### Power system errors\n- Cannot use list type directly in get_entities call for electricity group\n- Use correct API calls for checking power network status\n\n### Recipe crafting errors\n- Cannot craft items that require furnace/assembly machine directly from inventory\n- Ensure proper production chain is set up for intermediate products\n\n### Entity placement\n- Check entity positions and connections before placing new structures\n- Verify fluid connections in pipe networks are properly aligned"}
