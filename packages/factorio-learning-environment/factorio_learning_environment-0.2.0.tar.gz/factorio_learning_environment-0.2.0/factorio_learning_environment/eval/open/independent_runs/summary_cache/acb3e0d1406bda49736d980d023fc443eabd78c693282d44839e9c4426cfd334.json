{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Complex (around x=-8, y=-59)\nComplex system consisting of:\n- Three burner mining drills in a row at positions (-10.0, -59.0), (-8.0, -59.0), (-6.0, -59.0)\n- Three wooden chests at (-9.5, -57.5), (-7.5, -57.5), (-5.5, -57.5) collecting iron ore\n- Burner inserters at (-6.5, -57.5) and (-7.5, -56.5) transferring ore between chests\n- Transport belt system connecting the mining drills\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line (around x=-25, y=-59)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-28.0, -61.0) mining copper/iron ore\n- Stone furnace at (-27.0, -59.0) processing ore\n- Wooden chest at (-24.5, -58.5) storing plates\n- Burner inserter at (-25.5, -58.5) moving items from furnace to chest\n- Additional furnaces at (-23.0, -58.0) and (-21.0, -58.0)\n- Burner inserter at (-20.5, -59.5) feeding the furnaces\n\n### Smelting Array (around x=3, y=0)\nFour parallel smelting units, each consisting of:\n- Stone furnace at positions (0.0, 0.0), (2.0, 0.0), (4.0, 0.0), (6.0, 0.0)\n- Input wooden chests at (0.5, -2.5), (2.5, -2.5), (4.5, -2.5), (6.5, -2.5)\n- Output wooden chests at (0.5, 2.5), (2.5, 2.5), (4.5, 2.5), (6.5, 2.5)\n- Input burner inserters at (0.5, -1.5), (2.5, -1.5), (4.5, -1.5), (6.5, -1.5)\n- Output burner inserters at (0.5, 1.5), (2.5, 1.5), (4.5, 1.5), (6.5, 1.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities near transport belts\n- Check if the target position is already occupied by a transport belt before placing new entities\n- Remove blocking transport belts first if they need to be replaced\n- Consider using different positions or orientations when placing entities near belts\n\n### Errors when removing entities\n- Verify that the entity exists at the target position before attempting to remove it\n- Double check coordinates when trying to pick up entities\n- Consider adding error handling for cases where entities might have already been removed\n\n### Resource management issues\n- Multiple mining drills are out of fuel - implement better fuel distribution system\n- Some mining drills have blocked outputs - ensure proper item collection system is in place"}
