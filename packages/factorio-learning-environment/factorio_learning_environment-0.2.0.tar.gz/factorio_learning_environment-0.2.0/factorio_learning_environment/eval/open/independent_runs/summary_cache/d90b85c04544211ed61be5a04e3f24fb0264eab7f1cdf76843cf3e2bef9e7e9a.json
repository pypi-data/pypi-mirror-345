{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-12.5, 24.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (-12.5, 24.5)\n- Boiler at position (-5.5, 25.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Multiple PipeGroups connecting the entities, though they are currently not properly connected, leading to a non-functional status.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (15.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (15.0, 0.0) with a status of 'no ingredients to smelt', indicating a lack of input materials.\n- Inserters at positions (16.5, 0.5) and (17.5, 0.5), both not receiving electricity.\n- Wooden Chest at position (5.5, 0.5) containing iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (18.5, 0.5) currently empty.\n\n### Electricity Network\n- Includes an ElectricityGroup with poles distributed across various positions, though currently not supplying power to the inserters due to connectivity issues.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Pipes and Underground Pipes\n- Ensure that the target location is free from obstructions before attempting to place pipes or underground pipes.\n- Verify that the intended path for pipes is clear and that the pipes can connect to the intended entities.\n\n### Errors with Non-Functional Boiler and Steam Engine\n- Ensure that the boiler and steam engine are properly connected to the offshore pump and each other through a continuous pipe network.\n- Check that the boiler has a sufficient supply of water and fuel to operate.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Not Receiving Electricity\n- Verify that the electricity network is properly connected to the inserters.\n- Ensure that the small electric poles are correctly placed and connected to provide power to the inserters.\n\n### Errors with Obstructions Around Pump\n- Clear any obstructions around the offshore pump to ensure it can function properly and supply water to the boiler.\n\n### Errors with Entity Placement and Connection\n- Before placing any entity, ensure that the target tile is not occupied by another entity.\n- When connecting entities, ensure that they are within the correct range and orientation to establish a connection.\n\nBy addressing these errors, the agent can improve the efficiency and functionality of its structures in the game."}
