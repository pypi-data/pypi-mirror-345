{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mine at position(16.0, 71.0)\nConsists of Burner Mining Drill (position 16.0, 71.0), a wooden chest (position 15.5, 69.5), an inserter (position 16.5, 69.5) that takes iron ore from the wooden chest, another wooden chest (position 14.5, 69.5) that collects iron ore, and another inserter (position 13.5, 69.5) that takes iron ore from the new chest.\n\n### Iron Plate Smelter at position(16.0, 68.0)\nConsists of Stone Furnace (position 16.0, 68.0), a Burner Inserter (position 17.5, 68.5) that takes iron ore from the wooden chest (position 15.5, 69.5) via another inserter (position 16.5, 69.5), and a wooden chest (position 17.5, 67.5) that collects iron plates.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n* Errors when connecting transport belts directly to entities that are not outputting items directly\n  - Use an inserter to take items from the entity and then connect the transport belt to the inserter.\n* Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n  - Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it. Check the target position for any existing objects or terrain that may be unplaceable.\n* Errors when trying to connect to an inserter's drop_position that is already occupied\n  - Ensure the drop_position of the inserter is empty before attempting to connect to it. Check for any existing entities at the drop_position.\n* Errors due to undefined variables\n  - Ensure all variables are defined before using them. Check the code for any typos or missing assignments.\n* Errors when trying to get an entity at a position where it does not exist\n  - Ensure the entity exists at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it.\n\n### NAMESPACE\nNo utility functions have been defined by the agent."}
