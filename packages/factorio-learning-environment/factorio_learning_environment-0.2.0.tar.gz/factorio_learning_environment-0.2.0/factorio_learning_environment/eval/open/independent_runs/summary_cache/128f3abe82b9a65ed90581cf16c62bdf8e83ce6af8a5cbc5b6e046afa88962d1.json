{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Setup at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nThis setup is designed to extract and process iron ore, consisting of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and deposits it into a nearby chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to a furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates, but currently not receiving iron ore due to misalignment issues.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Alignment Errors\n- Ensure that the inserter's pickup position is correctly aligned with the chest's position. Misalignment will prevent the inserter from picking up items correctly.\n- Verify that the inserter's drop position is aligned with the furnace to ensure smooth transfer of materials.\n\n### Refueling Errors\n- Maintain a sufficient supply of coal in your inventory to refuel entities like mining drills and inserters. Running out of coal will halt operations.\n\n### Furnace Operation Issues\n- Check that the furnace is receiving the necessary ingredients (iron ore) to operate. Misalignment of inserters can lead to a lack of ingredients in the furnace, preventing it from functioning."}
