{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Mining and Smelting Complex at (-15, -50)\n- Burner mining drill mining iron ore (position x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n- Storage chest containing iron ore (position x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n- Stone furnace for smelting iron (position x=-14.0, y=-47.0)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Area (0, 0)\nConsists of three furnaces:\n- First furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Second furnace at position (4.0, 4.0)\n- Third furnace at position (6.0, 4.0)\n\n### Copper Processing Area\n- Stone furnace processing copper ore (position x=2.0, y=0.0)\n\n### Automation Science Pack Factory (24, 4)\n- Assembling machine (position x=24.5, y=4.5)\n- Input chest containing copper plates and iron gear wheels (position x=21.5, y=4.5)\n- Output chest containing products (position x=27.5, y=4.5)\n- Two burner inserters:\n  - Input inserter (position x=22.5, y=4.5)\n  - Output inserter (position x=26.5, y=4.5)\n- Electric poles for power (positions x=22.5, y=6.5 and x=24.5, y=6.5)\n\n### Power Generation System\n- Steam engine (position x=9.5, y=19.5)\n- Boiler (position x=-2.0, y=23.5)\n- Offshore pump (position x=-9.5, y=24.5)\n- Connected pipe network for water and steam\n- Electric pole network connecting power consumers\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Steam Engine Connection Issues\n- When connecting boiler to steam engine with pipes, ensure there is a valid path between them\n- Underground pipes and regular pipes must form a continuous connection\n\n### Entity Placement Issues\n- Lab entity could not be found at specified positions (24.5, 10.5), (24.5, 11.5), (24.5, 8.5)\n- Ensure the lab is actually built before trying to interact with it\n\n### Fuel Management Issues\n- Multiple instances of \"no coal to insert\" errors\n- Ensure sufficient coal is in inventory before attempting to fuel entities\n- Maintain better coal reserves for continuous operation of burner entities\n\n### Power Network Issues\n- Some entities showing NO_POWER status\n- Ensure all electrical entities are properly connected to the power network\n- Verify boiler has fuel and is generating steam for the steam engine\n\n### Resource Management\n- Several furnaces showing \"no ingredients to smelt\" warnings\n- Maintain better input material flow to keep production continuous"}
