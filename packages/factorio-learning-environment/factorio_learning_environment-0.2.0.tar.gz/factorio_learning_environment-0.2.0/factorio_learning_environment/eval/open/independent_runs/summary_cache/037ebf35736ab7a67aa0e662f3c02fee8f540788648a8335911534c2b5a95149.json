{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnaces**:\n  - Stone furnace at position (x=-15.0, y=-48.0) with coal as fuel.\n  - Stone furnace at position (x=-13.0, y=-48.0) with coal as fuel.\n  - Stone furnace at position (x=-11.0, y=-48.0) with coal as fuel.\n- **Burner Mining Drill**:\n  - Positioned at (x=4.0, y=-60.0), extracting iron ore and depositing into a chest at (x=4.5, y=-58.5).\n\n### Storage Area\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Wooden Chests**:\n  - Chest at position (x=4.5, y=-58.5) containing iron ore.\n  - Additional chests at positions (x=5.5, y=-60.5), (x=7.5, y=-60.5), (x=6.5, y=-60.5), (x=9.5, y=-60.5), (x=8.5, y=-60.5), and (x=-14.5, y=-50.5) for general storage.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items into full inventory\n- Ensure that the target inventory has sufficient space before attempting to insert items. This will prevent errors related to inventory overflow.\n\n### Errors when extracting from non-existent or empty entities\n- Verify that the entity from which you are trying to extract items exists and contains the required items. This will prevent extraction errors.\n\n### Errors when furnace fuel source is full\n- Regularly monitor the fuel levels in furnaces to avoid overfilling. Ensure that the fuel inventory is not at maximum capacity before adding more fuel.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- **insert_item**: Attempts to insert a specified quantity of an item into a target entity. Fails if the target inventory is full.\n- **extract_item**: Attempts to extract a specified quantity of an item from a target entity. Fails if the entity does not contain the specified item.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `furnace`: Represents a stone furnace entity used in various operations.\n- `extracted_iron_plates`: Stores the quantity of iron plates extracted from furnaces."}
