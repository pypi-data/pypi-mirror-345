The error \"TypeError: 'Chest' object is not callable\" suggests that a method intended for a different entity type was used on a chest. Verify the entity type and use the appropriate method.\n\n### Errors with Full Inventory\n- Regularly check and clear inventories of chests and other storage entities to"}
