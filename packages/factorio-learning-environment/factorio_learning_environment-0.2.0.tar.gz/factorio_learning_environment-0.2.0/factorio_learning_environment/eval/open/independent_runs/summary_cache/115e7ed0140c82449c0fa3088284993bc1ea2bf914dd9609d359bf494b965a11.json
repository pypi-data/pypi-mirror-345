{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nA complex production line for creating iron plates, consisting of:\n\nInput Layer (North):\n- 4 wooden chests at positions (0.5, -2.5), (2.5, -2.5), (4.5, -2.5), and (6.5, -2.5) storing coal, iron ore, and iron plates\n\nProcessing Layer (Middle):\n- 4 stone furnaces at positions (0.0, 0.0), (2.0, 0.0), (4.0, 0.0), and (6.0, 0.0)\n- 4 burner inserters at positions (0.5, -1.5), (2.5, -1.5), (4.5, -1.5), and (6.5, -1.5) moving materials from input chests to furnaces\n\nOutput Layer (South):\n- 4 wooden chests at positions (-2.5, 0.5), (2.5, 1.5), (4.5, 1.5), and (6.5, 1.5) for collecting processed iron plates\n- 4 burner inserters at positions (-1.5, 0.5), (1.5, 1.5), (3.5, 1.5), and (5.5, 1.5) moving processed plates from furnaces to output chests\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Output Blocking Issues\n- Ensure there is a valid destination entity (like a chest) in place before activating inserters\n- Some inserters are showing \"output blocked by item on the ground\" warnings\n\n### Resource Management Issues\n- Monitor coal levels in inserters - some attempts to add fuel failed due to lack of coal in inventory\n- Keep track of input resources - some furnaces are showing \"no ingredients to smelt\" warnings\n\n### Space Management\n- Multiple inserters are waiting for space in destination - ensure output containers have sufficient space\n- Consider adding more storage capacity or improving the output flow\n\n### Resource Flow Issues\n- Some inserters are waiting for source items - ensure consistent supply of materials in input chests\n- Balance the input of materials across all furnaces to maintain steady production"}
