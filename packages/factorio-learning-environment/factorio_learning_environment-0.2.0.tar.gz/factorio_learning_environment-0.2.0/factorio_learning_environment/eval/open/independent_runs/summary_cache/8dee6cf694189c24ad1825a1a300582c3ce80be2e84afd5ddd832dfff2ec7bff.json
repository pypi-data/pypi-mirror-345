{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Coal Storage at position (-28.5, -62.5)\n- **Coal Chest**: Contains 20 coal.\n\n#### Mining Operation at position (-28.0, -61.0)\n- **Mining Drill**: Currently out of fuel and unable to operate due to a full drop chest at (-27.5, -59.5).\n\n#### Drop Chest at position (-27.5, -59.5)\n- **Wooden Chest**: Used to collect mined items. Currently full, preventing further mining operations.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Repeated Failed Coal Insertion\n- The agent repeatedly attempts to insert coal into the mining drill but fails because there is no coal in the inventory. Ensure the agent has coal in its inventory before attempting to insert it.\n\n#### Full Drop Chest Preventing Mining\n- The mining drill is unable to operate because the drop chest at (-27.5, -59.5) is full. Empty the chest to allow the mining drill to continue functioning.\n\n#### Failed Entity Placement Due to Insufficient Inventory\n- The agent attempted to place a wooden chest next to the mining drill but failed due to insufficient items in the inventory. Ensure the agent has the necessary items before attempting to place entities.\n\n#### Incorrect Crafting Attempt\n- The agent attempted to craft wood, which is a raw resource that must be gathered rather than crafted. Ensure the agent understands which items can be crafted and which must be gathered.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n#### Utility Functions\n- **place_entity_next_to(Prototype, position, direction, spacing)**: \n  - **Failure Mode**: Failed to place a wooden chest due to insufficient items in inventory.\n  - **Success Mode**: Not observed in the logs.\n\n- **craft_item(Prototype, quantity)**:\n  - **Failure Mode**: Attempted to craft wood, which cannot be crafted.\n  - **Success Mode**: Not observed in the logs.\n\n#### Important Variables\n- **Player Inventory**: Contains iron-ore (904), copper-ore (1055), and iron-plate (3858)."}
