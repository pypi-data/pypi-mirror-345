In the logs, the 'Chest' object was mistakenly used as a callable. Verify the object type before attempting to call it.\n\n### Errors when picking up entities\n- Ensure that the entity you are trying to pick up is correctly referenced. In the logs, there was an attempt to pick up an entity using an incorrect reference. Double-check the entity variable or identifier before using it in functions."}
