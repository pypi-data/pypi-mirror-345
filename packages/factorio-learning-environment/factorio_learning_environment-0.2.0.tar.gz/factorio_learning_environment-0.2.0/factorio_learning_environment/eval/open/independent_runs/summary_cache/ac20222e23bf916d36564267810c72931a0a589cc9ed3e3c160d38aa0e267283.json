{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-11.5, 18.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam engine at position(-11.5, 18.5)\n- Boiler at position(-11.5, 25.0)\n- Offshore pump at position(-9.5, 24.5)\n- Small electric pole at position(-11.5, 26.5)\n\n### Lab at position(2.5, -18.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab at position(2.5, -18.5)\n\n### Furnace at position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace at position(0.0, 0.0)\n\n### Furnace at position(5.0, 5.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace at position(5.0, 5.0)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting entities\n- Ensure that the entities you are trying to connect are within the required range. In the case of the boiler and offshore pump, check their positions and the connection points to ensure they are aligned correctly for the pipe connection.\n  \n### Errors when using electric poles\n- Verify that the electric poles are placed correctly and within the range of the entities they are meant to power, such as the lab. \n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity on a tile before attempting to place it. Check for any existing entities that may block the placement. \n\n### General connection errors\n- Always check the status of the entities you are connecting to ensure they are ready to accept connections (e.g., ensure that the boiler and offshore pump have the necessary inputs and outputs)."}
