{"content": "The inspection of the active furnace has revealed critical information regarding its operational capabilities:\n\n### Active Furnace Recipe Details:\n- The active furnace is configured with the following:\n  - **Ingredients**: Requires **5 pieces of stone**.\n  - **Products**: No outputs defined, indicating it is not set to produce anything.\n  - **Enabled**: The status is **False**, meaning it cannot process any materials, including Copper Ore.\n\n### Current Active Furnace Status:\n- The active furnace currently contains **3 pieces of Copper Ore** and **18 Iron Plates**.\n- It remains in a **\"NO INGREDIENTS\"** state, indicating that it cannot smelt due to the lack of required stone.\n\n### Overall Inventory Overview:\n- **Current Inventory**:\n  - 4 pieces of stone furnaces\n  - 7 pieces of coal remaining\n  - 6 pieces of stone\n  - 5 pieces of iron ore\n  - **3 pieces of iron plates available**.\n\n### Observations:\n- The furnace is not operational because it lacks the necessary stone to enable its smelting capabilities.\n- The Copper Ore cannot be processed until the furnace is enabled by providing the required stone.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Insert Stone into the Furnace**: Load **5 pieces of stone** into the furnace to enable it for smelting.\n2. **Reinsert Copper Ore**: After enabling the furnace, I will ensure that the Copper Ore is loaded for processing.\n3. **Monitor the Smelting Process**: Once the furnace is enabled, observe to confirm that it begins processing the Copper Ore.\n\nLet\u2019s proceed by inserting the required stone into the active furnace. \n\"\"\"\n\n# Load stone into the active furnace to enable smelting\ninsert_item(Prototype.Stone, active_furnace, quantity=5)  # Insert 5 pieces of stone into the active furnace\n\n# Check the inventory status of the furnace after loading stone\nactive_furnace_inventory_status_after_stone_insert = inspect_inventory(active_furnace)  # Inspect the status of the furnace post-insertion\noverall_inventory_after_stone_loading = inspect_inventory()  # Check total inventory after loading.\n\nprint(f\"Active Furnace inventory status after loading stone: {active_furnace_inventory_status_after_stone_insert}\")  # Status of the furnace after loading stone.\nprint(f\"Overall current inventory after loading stone: {overall_inventory_after_stone_loading}\")  # Total inventory after operations.\nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")  # Review entities displayed on the map.", "summary_range": "[1-308]"}
