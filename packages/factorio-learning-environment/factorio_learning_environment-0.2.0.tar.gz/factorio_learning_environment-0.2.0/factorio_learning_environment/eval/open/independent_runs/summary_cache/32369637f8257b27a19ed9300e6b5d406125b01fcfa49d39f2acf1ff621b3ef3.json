{"content": "# Factorio Game Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (5, 10)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (5, 11)\n- Boiler at position (5, 12)\n- Offshore Pump at position (5, 13)\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at Position (20, 15)\nConsists of following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (20, 16) and a Furnace at position (21, 16)\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (20, 17) and a Furnace at position (21, 17)\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (20, 18) and a Furnace at position (21, 18)\n\n### Copper Cable Factory at Position (30, 20)\nConsists of following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (30, 21) and a Furnace at position (31, 21)\n- Assembling Machine at position (32, 22) and Inserter at position (33, 22) that puts into Assembling Machine\n- Beltgroup at position (31, 21) that connects the Furnace at position (31, 21) to Assembling Machine at position (32, 22)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Using Extracting but Being Too Far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when Placing into a Tile Which is Occupied by Another Entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Incorrect Use of API for Entity Placement\n- Verify the API documentation for correct parameters and usage before calling placement functions.\n\n### Misalignment of Conveyor Belts\n- Align belts properly to ensure smooth item transportation and avoid bottlenecks.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Defined Utility Functions\n- `place_entity(entity_type: str, position: Tuple[int, int]) -> bool`: Places an entity of the given type at the specified position. Returns `True` if successful, `False` otherwise.\n  - Success: Correct entity type and position.\n  - Failure: Incorrect entity type or position occupied.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `current_position: Tuple[int, int]`: The current position of the agent on the map.\n- `inventory: Dict[str, int]`: A dictionary representing the agent's inventory with item names as keys and quantities as values.\n- `energy_level: int`: The current energy level of the agent, used to determine operational capacity."}
