{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (x=6.0, y=-62.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (x=6.0, y=-62.0) with status NO_INGREDIENTS\n- Furnace at position (x=9.0, y=-64.0) with status FULL_OUTPUT\n- Inserter at position (x=6.5, y=-60.5) with status NO_POWER\n- Wooden chest at position (x=7.5, y=-61.5) and another at (x=6.5, y=-59.5)\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=-5.5, y=24.0)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5) with status NOT_CONNECTED\n- Boiler at position (x=-5.5, y=24.0) with status NOT_CONNECTED\n- Steam engine at position (x=-1.5, y=24.5) with status NOT_CONNECTED\n- Multiple pipe groups connecting these entities, but with connection issues\n\n### Lab Setup\n- Lab with status NO_POWER\n\n### Electricity Network\n- Multiple small electric poles, some with status NOT_PLUGGED_IN_ELECTRIC_NETWORK\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Pipe Connections\n- Ensure that pipes are correctly connected between the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine. Check for any placement blockages or incorrect connections that may prevent fluid flow.\n\n### Power Connectivity Issues\n- Verify that all electric poles are connected to the power network. Ensure that poles are correctly placed to connect all necessary entities to the power grid.\n\n### Inserter and Lab Power Issues\n- Check that inserters and labs are connected to a powered electric network. Ensure that there are no gaps in the electric pole connections that could lead to power loss.\n\n### Incorrect Argument Usage\n- When interacting with entities such as pipes, ensure that the correct argument types are used in function calls, particularly ensuring that position arguments are properly formatted as Position objects."}
