{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) connected to a transport belt network.\n- Transport Belt network connecting the mining drill to a Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5).\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5) transferring items to a Wooden Chest at position (-12.5, -54.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (-12.5, -54.5) storing iron ore.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -70.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-18.0, -70.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -65.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-21.0, -62.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Transport Belt network connecting these furnaces to various inserters and chests.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) connected to a transport belt network.\n- Transport Belt network connecting the mining drill to a Wooden Chest at position (-23.5, -69.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (-23.5, -69.5) storing copper ore.\n\n### Coal Mining Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5) storing coal.\n\n### Miscellaneous Structures\n- Various Belt Groups connecting different parts of the facilities, ensuring the flow of resources between mining drills, furnaces, and chests.\n- Multiple Burner Inserters at various positions waiting for source items, indicating potential misalignment or supply issues.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Ensure there is no existing object at the target location before attempting to place a new entity. This will prevent errors like \"Could not place transport-belt at (-18.5, -64.5)\".\n\n### Inserter waiting for source items\n- Check the alignment of inserters and ensure that the source supply is adequate. Inserters at positions (-20.5, -66.5) and (-17.5, -64.5) are waiting for source items, indicating potential misalignment or insufficient supply.\n\n### Furnace with no ingredients to smelt\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to operate. Multiple furnaces are currently inactive due to a lack of ingredients, which can be resolved by ensuring a steady supply of raw materials."}
