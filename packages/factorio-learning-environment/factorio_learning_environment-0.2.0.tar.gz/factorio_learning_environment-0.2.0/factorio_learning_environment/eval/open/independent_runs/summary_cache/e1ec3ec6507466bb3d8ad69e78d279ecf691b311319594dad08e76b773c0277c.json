It currently has a warning indicating no ingredients to smelt.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5) used to transfer items between chests.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when extracting items from non-existent or incorrect entities\n- Ensure that the target entity from which you want to extract items exists and contains the required items before attempting extraction.\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Verify that the target tile is unoccupied before placing an entity. Consider adjusting the spacing or changing the direction if the target position is occupied.\n\n### Errors when placing entities near existing structures\n- When placing entities next to existing structures, ensure there is enough space and that the placement does not collide with other entities. Adjust spacing, direction, or reference position if necessary."}
