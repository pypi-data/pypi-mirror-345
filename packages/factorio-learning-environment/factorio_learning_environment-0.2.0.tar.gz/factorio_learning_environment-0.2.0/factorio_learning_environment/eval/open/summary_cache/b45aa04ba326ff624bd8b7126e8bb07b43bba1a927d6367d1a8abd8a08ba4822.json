{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron ore mining and smelting structure at position around (17.5, 72.5)\nConsists of the following connected entities:\n- Electric mining drill at position (17.5, 72.5) facing down, powered but output blocked due to furnace belt blockage.\n- Stone furnace at position (18.0, 75.0) fueled with coal, working but with full output inventory.\n- Two wooden chests at positions (19.5, 75.5) and (21.5, 75.5), serving as storage for smelted iron plates.\n- Additional wooden chest at (21.5, 77.5) receiving iron plates.\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5) and (20.5, 77.5) fueled and operational, moving items between chests and furnace.\n- Small electric pole at (15.5, 75.5) connected to power network.\n- Output belt blockage at furnace output persists, causing mining drill to wait for space.\n\nThis structure enables iron ore extraction, smelting, and staged storage with improved inserter fueling and power connectivity, though output blockage remains unresolved.\n\n### Steam power generation structure at position around (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, -0.5) extracting water.\n- Boiler at (-5.0, 2.5), currently out of fuel and not working.\n- Steam engine at (0.5, 6.5) connected by pipes, working and generating power.\n- Small electric poles near boiler (-4.5, -0.5), steam engine (0.5, 3.5), and new poles at (0.5, 6.5), (17.5, 72.5), and (25.5, 80.5) connected to power network.\n\nThis structure reliably generates electricity from steam power, but boiler fuel supply needs attention to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Iron gear wheel assembly structure at position around (25.5, 80.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine 2 at (25.5, 80.5), powered and connected to small electric pole at (25.5, 80.5).\n- Input wooden chest at (21.5, 75.5) supplying iron plates.\n- Output wooden chest at (25.5, 82.5).\n- Burner inserter at (25.5, 83.5) fueled and operational, moving assembled items into output chest.\n- Despite repeated insertion of iron plates into input chest and assembler, assembling machine input and output inventories remain empty, indicating crafting is not occurring.\n- Assembling machine reports shortage of iron plates preventing crafting.\n\nThis structure is intended for iron gear wheel production and now has power and output inserter setup but requires troubleshooting to enable crafting despite apparent iron plate supply.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity placement conflicts due to occupied tiles\n- Repeated failure to place small electric poles near furnace at (18.0, 75.0) due to collision with mining drill at (17.5, 72.5) and water tiles.\n- To avoid placement failures, verify tile occupancy before placement, increase spacing, change direction, or select alternate reference positions.\n\n### Inserter inventory and fuel management\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5), (20.5, 77.5), and (25.5, 83.5) consistently fueled and operational.\n- Inserters sometimes wait for source items despite sufficient fuel, indicating possible inventory or routing issues.\n- Continue monitoring inserter fuel and source/destination inventories to prevent stoppages.\n\n### Crafting and recipe dependency errors\n- Assembling machine at (25.5, 80.5) repeatedly reports iron plate shortage preventing iron gear wheel crafting.\n- Iron plates are extracted from chests and inserted into assembler input chest, but assembler input and output inventories remain empty.\n- This suggests possible issues with assembler recipe setup, input chest connection, or inserter timing.\n- Verify assembler recipe correctness, ensure inserters place items into assembler input inventory, and confirm output chest is accessible.\n\n### Output blockage and power connectivity warnings\n- Mining drill at (17.5, 72.5) continues to report \"furnace belt at drop position is blocked,\" causing output blockage and waiting status.\n- Furnace output inventory frequently full, preventing further smelting output.\n- Boiler at (-5.0, 2.5) is out of fuel, causing steam power generation to be partially interrupted.\n- Power network connectivity improved with additional poles at (0.5, 6.5), (17.5, 72.5), and (25.5, 80.5).\n- To resolve output blockage, clear or extend output belts and chests to accept items.\n- Maintain boiler fuel supply to ensure continuous steam power"}
