{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (46.0, -82.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace at position (46.0, -82.0) that processes iron ore and copper ore. (Current state: fuel remaining coal: 31, output available; continues to warn \u201cno ingredients to smelt\u201d.)\n- Wooden chest at position (47.5, -81.5) that collects output from the furnace. (Note: The chest was replaced recently; inventory remains empty.)\n- Burner inserter at position (48.5, -81.5) that was replaced with a new extraction burner inserter. It is intended to supply items to a belt starting at drop position (49.5, -81.5), although subsequent belt connection and placement have encountered errors.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement and Connection Failures\n- Ensure that placements and connections utilize valid and unoccupied positions. In particular, validate the target position for placing entities such as transport belts (e.g. error at x=48.0, y=-81.5) to prevent exceptions.\n- Verify that all reference objects used in belt construction are correctly defined and available before initiating connection operations.\n\n### Unresolved API References and Import Issues\n- Check for proper definition or import of required API classes (e.g. BuildingBox) before usage. Confirm that all necessary classes are imported or defined to avoid NameError exceptions. \n\n### Consistency in Entity Handling\n- Consistently check container inventories immediately after placement or replacement and ensure entity references remain accurate during transitions.\n- Continue to validate that item requirements from inventory are met before placement to reduce inventory-related exceptions."}
