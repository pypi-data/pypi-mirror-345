{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position (x)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore pump (position -9.5, 24.5)\n- Boiler (position not specified)\n- Steam engine (position not specified)\n\n### Copper plate mine at position (x)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position not specified) and a furnace at position (1.0, 1.0)\n- Burner mining drill (position not specified) and a furnace at position (10.0, 1.0)\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine (position not specified) and inserter (position not specified) that puts into the assembling machine\n- Belt group (position not specified) that connects the furnace at position (1.0, 1.0) to the assembling machine\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing electric poles\n- Ensure that the target location for placing electric poles is clear of any blocking entities or terrain that cannot be built upon, such as water.\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities\n- Verify the position of the entity you are trying to retrieve. If the entity does not exist at the specified coordinates, ensure you are using the correct position for your intended action. \n\n### Repeated Errors\n- The same errors regarding the placement of electric poles and retrieval of steam engines have occurred multiple times. Addressing the underlying issues with placement and ensuring correct positioning will help mitigate these errors in future steps."}
