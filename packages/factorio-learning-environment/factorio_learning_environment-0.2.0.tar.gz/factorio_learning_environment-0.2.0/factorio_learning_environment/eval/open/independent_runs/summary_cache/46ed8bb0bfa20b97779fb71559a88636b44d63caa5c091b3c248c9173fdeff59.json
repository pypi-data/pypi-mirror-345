{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Storage Facility at Position (41.5, -79.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest at position (41.5, -79.5) with inventory containing coal.\n- Burner inserter at position (41.5, -78.5) and another at (41.5, -77.5) for transferring coal into the chest.\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) storing extracted iron ore.\n- Burner inserter at position (-15.5, -48.5) transferring iron ore from the mining drill to the chest.\n- Stone furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0) for smelting iron ore.\n- Additional stone furnaces at positions (-11.0, -48.0) and (-9.0, -48.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Wooden chest at position (-12.5, -49.5) and (-9.5, -49.5) for additional storage.\n\n### Iron Plate Processing Facility at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (41.0, -82.0) extracting resources.\n- Stone furnace at position (43.0, -82.0) for smelting resources into iron plates.\n- Iron chest at position (41.5, -80.5) storing coal.\n- Burner inserters at positions (40.5, -80.5), (42.5, -80.5), and (43.5, -80.5) for transferring resources between entities.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Extracting Resources\n- Ensure that the agent is close enough to the ore chest or storage entity before attempting to extract resources. This will prevent extraction failures.\n\n### Errors in Transferring Iron Ore to Furnaces\n- Verify that the furnaces have the necessary ingredients and are not full before attempting to transfer iron ore. This will prevent transfer failures.\n\n### Errors with Full Storage\n- Regularly check and empty storage chests to avoid warnings about full chests, which can halt mining operations.\n\n### General Inventory Management\n- Keep track of inventory levels and ensure there is sufficient space and resources available to perform desired actions."}
