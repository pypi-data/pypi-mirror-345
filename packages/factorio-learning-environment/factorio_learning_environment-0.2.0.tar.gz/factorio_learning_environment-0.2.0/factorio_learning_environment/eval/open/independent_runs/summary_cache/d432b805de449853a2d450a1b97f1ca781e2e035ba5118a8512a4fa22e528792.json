{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-13.5, 20.0)\nConsists of boiler (position -13.5, 20.0) and steam engine (position -18.5, 19.5) connected to the nearest electric pole. The boiler is currently out of fuel, and the steam engine is not connected to the power network.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(-21.5, -73.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace (position 5.0, -73.0) with status FULL_OUTPUT, currently smelting copper ore into iron plates.\n- Furnace (position -18.0, -49.0) with status NO_INGREDIENTS, currently unable to operate due to lack of ingredients.\n\n### Offshore Pump at position(-11.5, 26.5)\nConsists of an offshore pump (position -11.5, 26.5) which is currently working and connected to a fluid system.\n\n### Lab at position(-17.5, 23.5)\nConsists of a lab (position -17.5, 23.5) which is currently not conducting any research.\n\n### Assembling Machine at position(-21.5, 25.5)\nConsists of an assembling machine (position -21.5, 25.5) which is not receiving electricity and cannot create automation-science-pack due to missing resources.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to furnace status\n- Ensure that the furnace has the necessary ingredients and is powered before attempting to use it. Check the status of the furnace to confirm it is in working condition.\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities\n- Verify the position of the entity you are trying to access. Ensure that the entity exists at the specified coordinates before attempting to retrieve it.\n\n### Errors when connecting structures\n- Ensure that all components of the electricity generator (boiler and steam engine) are properly connected to a power network. Check for any missing connections or fuel requirements.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity on a tile before attempting to place it. Check for existing entities that may block placement."}
