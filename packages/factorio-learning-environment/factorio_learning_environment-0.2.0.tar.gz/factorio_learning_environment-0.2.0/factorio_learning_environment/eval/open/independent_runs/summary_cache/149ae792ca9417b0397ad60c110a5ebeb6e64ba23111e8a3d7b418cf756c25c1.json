{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=10.5, y=34.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=10.5, y=34.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=0.5, y=28.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-3.5, y=27.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting the offshore pump and boiler, with pipes at positions [(x=-3.5, y=26.5), (x=-2.5, y=26.5), (x=-1.5, y=26.5), (x=-1.5, y=27.5), (x=-1.5, y=28.5)]\n- PipeGroup connecting the boiler and steam engine, with pipes at positions [(x=1.5, y=26.5), (x=0.5, y=26.5), (x=3.5, y=26.5), ..., (x=10.5, y=29.5), (x=10.5, y=31.5), (x=10.5, y=30.5)]\n\n### Power Network\n- ElectricityGroup with poles connecting from the lab at position (x=5.5, y=5.5) to the power source at position (x=10.5, y=34.5), with poles at various positions including [(x=9.5, y=23.5), (x=13.5, y=27.5), (x=7.5, y=13.5), ..., (x=16.5, y=31.5), (x=12.5, y=34.5), (x=7.5, y=9.5)]\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing Facility\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=40.0, y=-84.0) connected to a wooden chest at position (x=40.5, y=-82.5)\n- Wooden chest at position (x=41.5, y=-83.5)\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=54.5, y=-83.5) with pickup at (x=53.5, y=-83.5) and drop at (x=55.5, y=-83.5)\n- Wooden chest at position (x=56.5, y=-83.5) containing iron plates\n- BeltGroup with belts at positions [(x=50.5, y=-86.5) -> (x=48.5, y=-86.5), direction=LEFT], [(x=49.5, y=-86.5) -> (x=47.5, y=-86.5), direction=LEFT]\n- Additional belts at positions [(x=43.5, y=-84.5) -> (x=45.5, y=-84.5), direction=RIGHT], [(x=45.5, y=-85.5) -> (x=47.5, y=-85.5), direction=RIGHT], [(x=52.5, y=-83.5) -> (x=52.5, y=-85.5), direction=UP]\n\n### Storage\n- Iron chests at positions [(x=0.5, y=0.5), (x=1.5, y=0.5), (x=2.5, y=0.5)] storing various resources\n\n### Laboratory\n- Lab at unspecified position with input for automation science packs\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Boiler to Steam Engine\n- Ensure that the pipe connections between the boiler at position (x=0.5, y=28.0) and the steam engine at position (x=10.5, y=34.5) are correctly aligned and not obstructed by other entities. Verify that the correct type of pipe is being used and that it is properly connected to both the boiler and the steam engine.\n\n### Errors in Power Network Expansion\n- When expanding the power network, ensure that all electric poles are properly connected and that there are no gaps in the network that could result in a failure to transmit power. Double-check the alignment and spacing of poles to maintain a continuous power line.\n\n### Errors in Inventory Management\n- Regularly check and manage the inventory of chests and other storage entities to prevent them from becoming full, which can halt production processes. Ensure that there is a system in place to move items from full chests to available storage or processing units."}
