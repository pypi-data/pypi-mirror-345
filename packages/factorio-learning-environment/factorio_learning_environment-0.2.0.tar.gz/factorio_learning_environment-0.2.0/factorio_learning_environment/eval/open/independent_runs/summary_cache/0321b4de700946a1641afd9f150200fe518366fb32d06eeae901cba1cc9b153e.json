{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-2.5, 25.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Boiler** at position (-2.5, 25.0) with status NO_FUEL, connected to:\n  - **Pipe** at position (-2.5, 23.5)\n  - **Pipe** at position (-4.5, 25.5)\n  - **Pipe** at position (-4.5, 24.5)\n- **Steam Engine** at position (1.5, 27.5) with status WORKING, connected to:\n  - **Pipe** at position (1.5, 24.5)\n  - **Small Electric Pole** at position (0.5, 24.5)\n- **Offshore Pump** at position (-7.5, 25.5) with status WORKING, connected to:\n  - **Pipe** at position (-6.5, 24.5)\n  - **Pipe** at position (-7.5, 24.5)\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- **PipeGroup** (fluid_system=10058, fluid=steam) starting at position (-0.5, 13.5) with status WORKING, connecting various positions including (x=-0.5, y=13.5), (x=0.5, y=13.5), (x=-2.5, y=15.5), and more.\n- **PipeGroup** (fluid_system=10057, fluid=water) starting at position (-6.5, 24.5) with status FULL_OUTPUT, connecting positions (x=-6.5, y=24.5), (x=-7.5, y=24.5), (x=-4.5, y=25.5), and more.\n- **PipeGroup** (fluid_system=10056) starting at position (-12.5, 21.5) with status EMPTY, connecting positions (x=-12.5, y=21.5), (x=-11.5, y=21.5), (x=-10.5, y=23.5), and more.\n\n### Electricity Network\n- **ElectricityGroup** (id=61007) with poles at positions (x=-7.5, y=22.5), (x=-6.5, y=22.5), (x=-4.5, y=22.5), and more, with voltage 0.\n\n### Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0)\n- **Stone Furnace** with fuel inventory containing coal, status NO_INGREDIENTS, and warnings for no ingredients to smelt and full fuel source.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors in connecting offshore pump to boiler\n- Verify that the connection path is clear and that the entities are correctly aligned and positioned for connection.\n\n### Errors in setting up steam engine\n- Check that the target location for the steam engine is clear of obstacles and is suitable for placement.\n\n### API Misuse Errors\n- Ensure that the correct data types and structures are used when interacting with the API to avoid type-related errors, such as \"string indices must be integers\" or \"Position object is not callable\".\n\n### Fuel Management Errors\n- Keep track of fuel inventory and ensure that there is sufficient fuel available before attempting to refuel entities like boilers."}
