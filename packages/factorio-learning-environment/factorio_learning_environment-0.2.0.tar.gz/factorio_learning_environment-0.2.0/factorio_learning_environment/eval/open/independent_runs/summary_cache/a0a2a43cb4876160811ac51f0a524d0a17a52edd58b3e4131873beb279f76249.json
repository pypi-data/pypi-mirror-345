{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and deposits it into a nearby chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates, but currently not receiving iron ore due to setup issues.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Inserter Setup\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items from the chest to the furnace. Frequent repositioning indicates a persistent setup issue.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Iron Ore\n- Verify the inserter's functionality and alignment to ensure it is correctly transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace. Check for any obstructions or misalignments that may prevent the transfer.\n\n### Insufficient Fuel for Inserters and Mining Drills\n- Maintain an adequate supply of coal in the inventory to refuel inserters and mining drills. Running out of fuel can halt operations, leading to inefficiencies in resource processing.\n\n### Chest Full Warning\n- Regularly monitor and empty the chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) to prevent the mining drill from stopping due to a full chest. This ensures continuous mining operations.\n\n### Furnace Lacking Ingredients\n- Ensure that the furnace is supplied with the necessary ingredients (iron ore) to function. The current setup indicates the furnace is not receiving the required materials for smelting."}
