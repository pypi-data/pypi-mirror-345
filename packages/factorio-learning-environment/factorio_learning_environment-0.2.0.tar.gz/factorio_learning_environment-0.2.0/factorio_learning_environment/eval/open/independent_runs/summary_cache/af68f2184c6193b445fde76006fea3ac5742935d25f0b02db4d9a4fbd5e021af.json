{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-47.5, -122.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\n- Pipe at Position (-47.5, -122.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-46.5, -121.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (-41.5, -117.5)\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-19.0, -73.0) for smelting copper ore\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0) for smelting iron ore\n\n### Miscellaneous Structures\n- Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0) (currently not in use)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5)\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) (not receiving electricity)\n- Lab with Automation Science Packs (status: no power)\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- PipeGroup at Position (-47.5, -122.5) with water (status: full output)\n- Multiple other PipeGroups in various positions (status: empty)\n\n### Electricity Network\n- Electricity Group with poles at various positions (voltage: 0)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Boiler Connection Errors\n- Ensure that the boiler is properly connected to the water source. Check the alignment and connectivity of pipes between the offshore pump and the boiler to resolve the \"Boiler is still not connected to the water source\" error.\n\n### Inserter Power Supply Issues\n- Verify that inserters are connected to a power source. Ensure that small electric poles are correctly placed and connected to provide electricity to inserters.\n\n### Steam Engine Connection Errors\n- Confirm that the steam engine is connected to the power network and receiving input liquid. Check the connections between the steam engine, boiler, and any power poles to ensure proper setup."}
