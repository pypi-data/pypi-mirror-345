{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at Position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0)\n  - Fuel: Inventory contains 3 units of coal.\n  - Status: Working with a warning that the output is blocked by an item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Drop Position: (x=-16.5, y=-52.5)\n  - Resources: Contains 40,000 units of iron ore.\n- **Stone Furnace** at Position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)\n  - Fuel: Inventory contains 14 units of coal.\n  - Status: No ingredients to smelt.\n  - Furnace Result: Contains 60 units of iron plate.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied or invalid locations\n- Ensure that the target tile is unoccupied and valid before attempting to place entities such as Burner Inserters, Transport Belts, Wooden Chests, and Stone Furnaces.\n\n### Errors due to blocked output\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity (like a chest or belt) to accept the output from mining drills to prevent blockage.\n\n### Errors due to undefined variables\n- Verify that all variables are defined before use. For example, ensure that 'ore_furnace' is correctly defined or imported in the script.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient inventory items\n- Check inventory levels before attempting to insert items into entities. Ensure you have the required items, such as coal, in your inventory before performing actions that require them."}
