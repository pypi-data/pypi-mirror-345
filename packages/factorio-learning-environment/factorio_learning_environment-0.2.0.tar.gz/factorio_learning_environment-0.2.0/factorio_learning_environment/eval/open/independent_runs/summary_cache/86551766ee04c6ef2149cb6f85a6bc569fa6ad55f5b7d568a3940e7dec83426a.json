{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=42.0, y=-83.0)\n  - Fuel: 1 coal\n  - Status: Waiting for space in destination\n  - Neighbours: Transport belt at (x=43.5, y=-82.5), Burner inserter at (x=42.5, y=-81.5)\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=42.5, y=-81.5)\n  - Fuel: 50 coal\n  - Status: Waiting for source items\n  - Neighbours: Burner mining drill at (x=42.0, y=-83.0), Transport belts at (x=43.5, y=-82.5) and (x=43.5, y=-80.5)\n- **Transport Belt Group**\n  - Inputs: Belt from (x=42.5, y=-82.5) to (x=44.5, y=-82.5), direction RIGHT\n  - Outputs: Belt from (x=43.5, y=-80.5) to (x=42.5, y=-79.5), direction LEFT\n  - Status: Empty\n  - Belts: 7 belts\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-15.0, y=-49.0)\n  - Fuel: 1 coal\n  - Status: Full output\n  - Furnace Source: 35 iron ore\n  - Furnace Result: 100 iron plates\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing Wooden Chests and Burner Inserters\n- **Cannot place Wooden Chest**: Ensure the target tile is unoccupied and has enough space before attempting to place a wooden chest. This error occurred at multiple positions such as (x=45.0, y=-79.5), (x=48.0, y=-79.5), and (x=56.0, y=-79.5).\n- **Cannot place Burner Inserter**: Verify that the target tile is free and suitable for placing a burner inserter. This error was noted at positions like (x=44.5, y=-79.5), (x=47.5, y=-79.5), and (x=55.5, y=-79.5).\n\n### Errors related to blocked outputs\n- **Output blocked by item on the ground**: Ensure there is a sink entity in place to accept the output from the burner mining drill. This can prevent the drill from becoming blocked and halting production.\n\n### Errors due to full output in Furnace\n- **Furnace result is full**: Regularly check and clear the output of the stone furnace to prevent it from reaching full capacity and stopping production."}
