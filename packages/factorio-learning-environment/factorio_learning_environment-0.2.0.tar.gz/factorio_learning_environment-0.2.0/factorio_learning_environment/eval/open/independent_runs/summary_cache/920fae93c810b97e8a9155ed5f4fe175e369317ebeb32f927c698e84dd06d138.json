{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) storing extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-15.5, y=-48.5) intended to transfer iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) intended for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Alignment Errors\n- Ensure the inserter's pickup position aligns with the chest's position to facilitate proper transfer of iron ore. Misalignment has been a recurring issue causing transfer failures.\n\n### Inserter Fueling Errors\n- Always check your inventory for coal before attempting to refuel inserters. An error was encountered due to a lack of coal in the inventory.\n\n### Furnace Input Errors\n- Verify that the inserter is correctly positioned to drop iron ore into the furnace. The furnace is currently not receiving iron ore, indicating a setup issue with the inserter."}
