To avoid this, ensure to regularly empty the chest or increase its capacity.\n  \n- **Errors when the furnace has no ingredients**: The stone furnace frequently reports 'no ingredients to smelt'. Ensure that there are sufficient raw materials in the furnace source inventory before inserting fuel.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- **Functions Defined**: No specific utility functions have been defined or invoked in the current execution logs.\n  \n- **Important Variables Assigned**:\n  - `coal`: int\n  - `iron-ore`: int\n  - `iron-plate`: int\n  - `wood`: int\n  - `furnace_status`: EntityStatus\n  - `final_inventory`: dict"}
