{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, -60.0) with a drop position at (4.5, -58.5), currently out of fuel and unable to continue mining due to a full chest.\n- **Wooden Chests** for storage at positions (5.5, -60.5), (4.5, -58.5), (-4.5, -52.5), (-5.5, -52.5), (-2.5, -52.5), (-14.5, -50.5), (-13.5, -50.5), (-12.5, -50.5), (-11.5, -50.5), (-10.5, -50.5), (-9.5, -50.5), (-8.5, -50.5), (-7.5, -50.5), (-6.5, -50.5).\n- **Iron Chest** at position (-3.5, -52.5) and (-5.5, -50.5) for additional storage capacity.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (-15.0, -48.0), (-13.0, -48.0), and (-11.0, -48.0), all with warnings indicating no ingredients to smelt and containing some iron plates already smelted.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors due to Out of Fuel\n- Ensure that all burner mining drills have sufficient fuel to continue operation. Regularly check and refuel to prevent mining interruptions.\n\n### Errors due to Full Storage\n- Regularly monitor and empty storage chests to prevent mining operations from halting due to full chests. Consider upgrading to larger chests or adding additional storage as needed.\n\n### Errors due to No Ingredients for Smelting\n- Ensure that stone furnaces have a continuous supply of raw materials to smelt. Check and maintain the supply chain from mining to smelting to prevent production halts.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- No utility functions or important variables were defined or invoked in the provided steps."}
