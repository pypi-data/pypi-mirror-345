Adjust spacing or change placement direction to avoid collisions.\n- Attribute access error:\n  \u2022 When using positional attributes (for example, accessing the center of a buildable area), refer to them as properties rather than calling them as functions.\n- Insufficient inventory for placement:\n  \u2022 Before attempting to place an entity (such as an assembling machine), verify that it is present in the inventory."}
