{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nThis facility is responsible for mining iron ore and processing it into iron plates. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): This drill extracts iron ore and drops it into the adjacent chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): This chest stores the mined iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): This inserter transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0): This furnace is intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates but is currently not receiving any ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Iron Ore\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly aligned and has a clear path to transfer iron ore from the chest to the furnace. Regularly check the inserter's alignment and reposition if necessary.\n\n### Chest Full Warning\n- Regularly monitor the chest's inventory to prevent it from becoming full. Extract iron ore from the chest to free up space for continuous mining operations.\n\n### Inserter Out of Fuel\n- Keep a sufficient supply of coal in the inventory to refuel inserters and other fuel-dependent machines. Regularly check fuel levels and refuel as needed to maintain uninterrupted operations.\n\n### Furnace Out of Ingredients\n- Ensure that the furnace has a continuous supply of iron ore to smelt. Check the inserter setup and chest inventory to ensure that iron ore is being transferred efficiently."}
