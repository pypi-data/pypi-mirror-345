Initially in a NO_FUEL state, it was refueled (after harvesting coal) to work temporarily before its status updated to WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION when repositioning of the sink chest failed.\n\u2022 Drill Inserter:\n\u2003\u2013 Drill Inserter at (-13.5, -47.5) transferring ore from the mining drill.\n\u2022 Output Sink & Extraction System:\n\u2003\u2013 Original Wooden Chest at (-14.5, -51.5) serving as the output sink.\n\u2003\u2013 Multiple attempts were made to reposition a new sink chest closer to the mining drill drop (including a temporary placement at (-11.5, -46.5) and attempted shifts to (-14.5, -48.5)), but all failed due to placement conflicts and prototype validation issues.\n\u2022 Belt Network Remnants:\n\u2003\u2013 Pre-existing belt segments connecting the mining drill drop to the smelting network remain unchanged.\n\u2003\u2013 An attempted connection using a transport belt from (-14.5, -48.5) to the sink chest failed because transport belts require an intermediary inserter when targeting container entities.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 Sink Chest Placement and Repositioning:\n\u2003\u2013 Verify that the target tile is free and buildable before placing a chest.\n\u2003\u2013 Use consistent and accurate prototype identifiers (for example, always \"wooden-chest\") to prevent prototype mismatches.\n\u2003\u2013 Ensure that all referenced entity variables are defined to avoid NameErrors.\n\u2022 Fuel Insertion:\n\u2003\u2013 Check that the inventory holds sufficient fuel (coal) before attempting an insertion; harvest resources if necessary.\n\u2022 Transport Belt Connections:\n\u2003\u2013 Do not connect transport belts directly to container entities; always use an inserter as the intermediary for item transfers.\n\u2022 Inventory Inspection:\n\u2003\u2013 Confirm the existence of an entity at the specified coordinates before inspecting its inventory to prevent NoneType errors.\n\nNAMESPACE\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 shift_entity_local(entity: Entity, offset: Tuple[float, float]) -> Entity  \n\u2003\u2013 Shifts the given entity\u2019s position by the specified offset.  \n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Invocation Note: The function was used during sink chest repositioning but failed when the entity\u2019s prototype did not match the expected type.\nImportant Variables:\n\u2022 furnace_input_chest_pos (Position) \u2013 Holds the position of the furnace\u2019s input chest.\n\u2022 current_player_inventory (Inventory) \u2013 Tracks the current state of the player\u2019s inventory."}
