{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) which extracts iron ore and deposits it into a chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-15.5, y=-51.5) that stores extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-51.5) which moves iron ore from the chest to a transport belt.\n- **Transport Belt** system connecting the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) that processes iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=0.5, y=-1.5) that moves iron plates from the furnace to a transport belt.\n\n### Belt System\n- **BeltGroup** connecting the mining drill output to the furnace input, consisting of 75 belts, facilitating the movement of materials across the facility.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Full Storage\n- Ensure that storage entities like chests are regularly emptied to prevent blockages. The chest at position (-15.5, -51.5) is full, which could halt mining operations.\n\n### Errors when Inserters are Waiting for Source Items\n- Verify that the source entities have items available for inserters to pick up. The burner inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-51.5) is waiting for source items, indicating a potential supply chain issue.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the given steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `Inventory`: A dictionary tracking the player's resources, including 'wood', 'coal', 'stone', 'iron-ore', and 'iron-plate'."}
