{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron ore mining and smelting structure at position around (17.5, 72.5)\nConsists of the following connected entities:\n- Electric mining drill at position (17.5, 72.5) facing down, powered but output still blocked due to furnace belt blockage.\n- Stone furnace at position (18.0, 75.0) fueled with coal, actively smelting iron ore with frequent coal insertion.\n- Three wooden chests at positions (19.5, 75.5), (21.5, 75.5), and (21.5, 77.5), serving as storage and input/output buffers for iron plates.\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5) and (20.5, 77.5) fueled and operational, moving items between chests and furnace.\n- Small electric pole at (17.5, 72.5) placed recently to improve power connectivity.\n- Output blockage at furnace belt remains unresolved, causing mining drill warnings.\n\nThis structure enables continuous iron ore extraction, smelting, and staged iron plate storage with improved power connectivity and inserter fueling, though output belt blockage persists.\n\n### Steam power generation structure at position around (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, -0.5) extracting water.\n- Boiler at position (-5.0, 2.5), recently refueled but currently out of fuel, causing temporary downtime.\n- Steam engine at position (0.5, 6.5) generating power, connected to boiler by pipes.\n- Small electric poles placed near steam engine (0.5, 6.5) and boiler (-4.5, -0.5), forming a connected power network.\n\nThis structure reliably generates electricity from steam power but requires consistent boiler fueling to avoid interruptions.\n\n### Iron gear wheel assembly structure at position around (25.5, 80.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine 2 at (25.5, 80.5), powered and actively crafting iron gear wheels with iron plates supplied directly into the machine.\n- Input wooden chest at (21.5, 75.5) feeding iron plates into assembly area.\n- Output wooden chest at (25.5, 82.5), currently empty, receiving assembled iron gear wheels.\n- Burner inserter at (25.5, 83.5) fueled and operational, intended to move items into output chest but output chest remains empty.\n- Small electric pole at (25.5, 80.5) placed recently, connected to power network.\n- Assembling machine input and output inventories show iron plates and iron gear wheels present, indicating active crafting.\n\nThis structure is fully powered and supplied with iron plates, producing iron gear wheels, but output chest remains empty, indicating possible extraction issues.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Persistent output blockage at furnace belt drop position\n- The electric mining drill at (17.5, 72.5) continues to report \"furnace belt at drop position is blocked,\" preventing smooth output flow.\n- The furnace output inventory frequently fills up, halting smelting progress.\n- To resolve, clear or extend output belts and ensure chests or belts downstream have capacity to accept items.\n- Regularly monitor belt and chest inventories to prevent blockage buildup.\n\n### Boiler fuel management and downtime\n- Boiler at (-5.0, 2.5) was recently refueled but currently out of fuel, causing it to stop and halt steam production temporarily.\n- Maintain a steady supply of coal to the boiler to avoid power interruptions.\n- Consider adding inserters or buffer chests to automate boiler fueling.\n\n### Electric pole placement conflicts and spacing issues\n- Attempts to place small electric poles near (18.0, 75.0) failed due to collisions with mining drill at (17.5, 72.5) and water tiles.\n- To avoid placement failures, verify tile occupancy and terrain before placing poles.\n- Adjust pole placement parameters such as spacing, direction, or reference position to find valid placement tiles.\n\n### Inserter fuel and inventory management\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5), (20.5, 77.5), and (25.5, 83.5) are consistently fueled and operational.\n- Continue monitoring inserter fuel levels and inventories to prevent stoppages.\n\n### Assembling machine output extraction failure\n- Error occurred when attempting to extract iron gear wheels from output chest at (25.5, 82.5), reporting no valid chest containing iron gear wheels.\n- Despite assembling machine output inventory showing iron gear wheels, the output chest remains empty.\n- Ensure burner inserter at (25.5, 83.5) is correctly positioned and operational to move items from assembling machine output to output chest.\n- Verify inserter pickup and drop positions and that output chest is accessible and not full.\n\nN"}
