{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-16.0, -51.0)\n  - Fuel: 3 units of coal\n  - Status: Working\n  - Warnings: Output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Neighbours: Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0)\n  - Resources: 40,000 units of iron ore\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-14.0, -49.0)\n  - Fuel: 12 units of coal\n  - Status: Working\n  - Furnace Source: 26 units of iron ore\n  - Furnace Result: 80 units of iron plate\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied or invalid locations\n- Ensure the target tile is free and suitable for the entity before attempting to place it. This includes checking for existing entities or obstructions.\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities from specific positions\n- Verify the presence of the entity at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it. This can prevent exceptions related to non-existent entities.\n\n### Errors when using incorrect arguments in API calls\n- Double-check the function signatures and ensure that the correct arguments are being passed. For instance, avoid using unexpected keyword arguments like 'quantity' in the `pickup_entity` function.\n\n### Errors related to item insertion\n- Ensure that the items being inserted are of the correct type and format expected by the target entity. For example, avoid passing boolean values when a number is expected.\n\n### Errors due to blocked outputs\n- Regularly clear the output area of mining drills or ensure that there is a sink entity, such as a furnace or chest, to accept the output."}
