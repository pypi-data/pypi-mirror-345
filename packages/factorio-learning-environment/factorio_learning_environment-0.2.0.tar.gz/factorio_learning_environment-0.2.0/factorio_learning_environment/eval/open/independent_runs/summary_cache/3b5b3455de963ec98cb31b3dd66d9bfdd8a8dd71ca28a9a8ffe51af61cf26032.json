{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (46.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entity:\n- Stone furnace at position (46.0, -82.0)\nUse-case: Processes iron ore into iron plates. Recent operations now show that after inserting 10 iron ore, the furnace initially produced 4 iron plates\u2014below the production target\u2014leading to a timeout error. Its updated internal state is recorded as having a furnace source inventory of 8 iron ore, a furnace result holding 14 iron plates, and fuel reduced to 7 units of coal.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to insufficient production output and delayed processing\n- Verify that the processing cycle receives adequate time to complete to meet production targets.\n- Adjust waiting periods or processing cycles to avoid timeouts when output production falls short.\n\n### Errors when inserting items despite resource unavailability\n- Confirm that inventory contains the intended resource prior to attempting insertion.\n- Double-check inventory levels to prevent errors arising from trying to insert a resource not present in the inventory.\n\n"}
