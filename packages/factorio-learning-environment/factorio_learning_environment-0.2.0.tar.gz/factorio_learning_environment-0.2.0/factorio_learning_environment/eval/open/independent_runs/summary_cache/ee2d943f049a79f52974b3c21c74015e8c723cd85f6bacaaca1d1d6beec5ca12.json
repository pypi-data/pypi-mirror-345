The maximum distance for direct connection is limited.\n- Boilers have specific connection points (fluid inputs and outputs) that must align with the pipes or other fluid entities.\n- Check the orientation of the boiler - it affects where the connection points are located.\n- When placing fluid entities, ensure there is a clear path for pipes to connect them.\n- Use the entity's connection_points property to understand where it can connect to other entities.\n\n### Errors when placing entities near existing structures\n- Check for existing pipes or other entities before placing new structures.\n- When using place_entity_next_to(), increase the spacing parameter if placement fails due to existing entities.\n- Consider different directions when the default placement direction is blocked.\n- When placing steam engines, ensure there is enough clear space as they are larger entities (3x5 tiles).\n\n### Errors with entity placement on invalid terrain\n- Some entities cannot be placed on water or other specific terrain types.\n- Check nearby entities that might be blocking placement and adjust positioning accordingly."}
