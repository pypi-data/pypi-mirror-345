{"content": "The error indicates that crafting the Boiler failed because it requires Pipes, which in turn require Iron Plates. Iron Plates need to be smelted from Iron Ore using a Furnace. Let's address this by gathering Iron Ore, smelting it into Iron Plates, and then proceeding with crafting the necessary components.\n\n# Step-by-step process to gather resources, smelt, and craft:\n\n## Step 1: Gather Iron Ore\n1. **Locate Iron Ore:** Find the nearest Iron Ore resource.\n   ```python\n   iron_ore_position = nearest(Resource.IronOre)\n   move_to(iron_ore_position)\n   ```\n\n2. **Mine Iron Ore:** Collect enough Iron Ore to smelt into Iron Plates.\n   ```python\n   harvest_resource(iron_ore_position, quantity=20)  # Adjust quantity as needed\n   ```\n\n## Step 2: Smelt Iron Ore into Iron Plates\n1. **Move to a Furnace:** If you have a Stone Furnace, move to it, or craft one if you haven't already.\n   ```python\n   move_to(furnace_position)  # Assume you have a position for a furnace\n   ```\n\n2. **Smelt Iron Ore:** Use the Furnace to smelt Iron Ore into Iron Plates.\n   ```python\n   smelt_item(Prototype.IronOre, quantity=20)  # Adjust quantity based on need\n   ```\n\n## Step 3: Craft Pipes\n1. **Craft Pipes:** With Iron Plates in your inventory, craft the Pipes needed for the Boiler.\n   ```python\n   craft_item(Prototype.Pipe, quantity=4)\n   ```\n\n## Step 4: Craft the Boiler\n1. **Craft Boiler:** Now that you have the necessary components, craft the Boiler.\n   ```python\n   crafted_boiler = craft_item(Prototype.Boiler)\n   assert crafted_boiler > 0, \"Failed to craft the Boiler.\"\n   ```\n\n## Step 5: Place the Boiler and Connect the System\n1. **Move to Placement Position:** Move to the desired position near the Offshore Pump.\n   ```python\n   move_to(pump_position)\n   ```\n\n2. **Place the Boiler:** Place the Boiler next to the Offshore Pump.\n   ```python\n   boiler_position = Position(x=pump_position.x, y=pump_position.y + 2)\n   boiler = place_entity(Prototype.Boiler, position=boiler_position)\n   ```\n\n3. **Fuel the Boiler:** Insert Coal into the Boiler.\n   ```python\n   insert_item(Prototype.Coal, boiler, quantity=10)\n   ```\n\n4. **Place the Steam Engine:** Place the Steam Engine next to the Boiler.\n   ```python\n   steam_engine_position = Position(x=boiler_position.x + 2, y=boiler_position.y)\n   steam_engine = place_entity(Prototype.SteamEngine, position=steam_engine_position)\n   ```\n\n5. **Connect Power with Small Electric Pole:** Ensure the pole is positioned to connect power.\n   ```python\n   pole_entity = next((entity for entity in get_entities() if entity.name == \"small-electric-pole\"), None)\n   if pole_entity:\n       if not pole_entity.position.is_close(steam_engine.position, tolerance=3):\n           pickup_entity(pole_entity)\n           pole_placement_position = Position(x=steam_engine.position.x + 1, y=steam_engine.position.y)\n           pole_entity = place_entity(Prototype.SmallElectricPole, position=pole_placement_position)\n\n       connect_entities(pole_entity, steam_engine)\n       connect_entities(pole_entity, assembling_machine)\n   ```\n\n## Step 6: Verify System Operation\n1. **Check Entity Status:** Ensure all entities are operational and connected.\n   ```python\n   for entity in get_entities():\n       print(f\"Entity: {entity.name}, Status: {entity.status}\")\n   ```\n\n2. **Confirm Setup Completion:** Final confirmation of the setup.\n   ```python\n   print(\"Power setup and connection complete.\")\n   print(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")\n   ```\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to gather the necessary resources, craft the required items, and set up a functional power system.", "summary_range": "[1-166]"}
