My current inventory now consists of:\n- 1 stone furnace\n- 10 pieces of coal\n- 5 pieces of stone\n- 10 pieces of iron ore\n\nWith sufficient resources gathered, I can now focus on crafting iron plates using the stone furnace. However, I need to ensure that I am within the correct range to place the stone furnace.\n\nSince previous attempts to place the stone furnace at a distant location have failed, I will first check my current position and then look for a nearby valid location to place the stone furnace. \n\nLet's confirm my current position and attempt to place the stone furnace again.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Check current player position\ncurrent_position = get_player_position()\nprint(f\"Current Player Position: {current_position}\")\n\n# Attempt to place the stone furnace at the current position if valid\nplace_entity(Prototype.StoneFurnace, position=current_position)", "summary_range": "[1-38]"}
