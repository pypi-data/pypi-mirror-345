{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Mine at position (x=22.0, y=77.5)\n\nThis structure mines iron ore, smelts it into iron plates, and stores the plates in chests. It consists of two parallel lines:\n\n*   **Line 1:**\n    *   Burner Mining Drill at position (x=22.0, y=74.0) mining iron ore.\n    *   Stone Furnace at position (x=22.0, y=76.0) smelting ore from the drill.\n    *   Burner Inserter at position (x=23.5, y=76.5) moving iron plates from the furnace to the chest.\n    *   Wooden Chest at position (x=24.5, y=76.5) storing iron plates.\n*   **Line 2:**\n    *   Burner Mining Drill at position (x=22.0, y=80.0) mining iron ore.\n    *   Stone Furnace at position (x=22.0, y=82.0) smelting ore from the drill.\n    *   Burner Inserter at position (x=23.5, y=82.5) moving iron plates from the furnace to the chest."}
