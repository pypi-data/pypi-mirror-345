{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-14.0, -49.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal\n  - Source: Iron Ore\n  - Result: Iron Plate\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-16.0, -49.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal\n  - Source: Iron Ore\n  - Result: Iron Plate\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -47.5)\n  - Fuel: Coal\n  - Transfers iron plates from the furnace at (-14.0, -49.0) to the wooden chest\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-13.5, -46.5)\n  - Stores iron plates transferred by the burner inserter\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Ensure the tile is unoccupied before attempting to place an entity. Check the environment and clear any obstructions.\n\n### Errors in crafting without required machinery\n- Iron plates cannot be crafted manually; they require smelting in a furnace. Ensure you have the necessary machinery set up before attempting to craft items that require it.\n\n### Errors due to incorrect entity dimensions\n- Validate the dimensions of entities before placement. Ensure that the input values for height and width are valid integers to avoid validation errors.\n\n### Errors when inserting items without available inventory\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into an entity. Double-check inventory levels to avoid insertion errors."}
