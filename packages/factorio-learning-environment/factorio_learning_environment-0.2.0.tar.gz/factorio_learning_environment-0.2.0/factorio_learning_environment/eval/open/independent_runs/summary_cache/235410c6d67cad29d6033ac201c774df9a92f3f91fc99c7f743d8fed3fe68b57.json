The agent repeatedly attempted to supply a Lab at position (0.5, 2.5) for Automation Science Pack research but placement failed due to crafting and inventory issues. Although existing furnaces were referenced (an alternative furnace at Position(x=5.0, y=5.0) and a copper furnace at Position(x=-27.0, y=-60.0)) for resource processing, these were not newly built structures and no additional entities were recorded on the map.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 get_entities API usage errors\n  - When calling get_entities, ensure that only the expected parameters are provided. Remove unsupported keywords such as \u201cradius\u201d and avoid passing any positional arguments if the API expects none.\n  - Validate the return value of get_entities (or its fallback) so that it is iterable before applying filters.\n\n\u2022 Lab placement and crafting errors\n  - Verify that the required Lab item is present in the inventory before attempting to place it on the map.\n  - Confirm that all precursor ingredients (for example, iron-gear-wheels, electronic circuits, and copper cables) are sufficiently available prior to starting Lab crafting.\n  - Integrate checks for crafting dependencies to prevent failures due to missing sub-ingredients.\n\n\u2022 Fallback and type-safety issues\n  - When a query returns None, immediately substitute an empty list to avoid TypeError related to iterating a NoneType.\n  - Use fallback approaches carefully and validate that subsequent operations can handle the empty collection appropriately."}
