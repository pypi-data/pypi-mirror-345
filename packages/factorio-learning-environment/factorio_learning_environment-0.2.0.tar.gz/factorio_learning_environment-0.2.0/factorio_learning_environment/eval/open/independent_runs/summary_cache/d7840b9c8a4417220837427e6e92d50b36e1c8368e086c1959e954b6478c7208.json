{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at position (-9.5, 24.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with coal as fuel and iron-plate production\n\n### Research Lab\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab with input for automation-science-pack, currently not powered\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when extracting or inserting items\n- Ensure the target entity contains the items you want to extract or has space for items you want to insert. Check the entity's inventory before attempting these actions.\n\n### Errors due to missing items in inventory\n- Verify that you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to place or craft entities. For example, ensure you have an offshore pump in your inventory before attempting to place it.\n\n### Errors in crafting due to locked recipes\n- Research the necessary technology before attempting to craft items that require it. For example, solar panels require the solar-energy technology to be unlocked.\n\n### Errors in crafting due to missing ingredients\n- Ensure you have all required ingredients before crafting. For instance, crafting a steam engine requires a specific number of iron plates, iron gear wheels, and pipes.\n\n### Errors when using incorrect data types\n- Ensure that you are using compatible data types in your calculations. For example, avoid adding integers to non-integer types like 'ModelPrivateAttr'.\n\n### Errors due to unconnected entities\n- Connect entities properly to ensure they function as intended. For example, the offshore pump needs to be connected to a fluid system to operate correctly."}
