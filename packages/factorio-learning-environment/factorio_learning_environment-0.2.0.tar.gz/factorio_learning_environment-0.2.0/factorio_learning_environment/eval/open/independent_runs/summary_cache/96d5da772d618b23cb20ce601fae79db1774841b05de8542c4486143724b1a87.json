{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\u2022 No new structures have been successfully built on the map. The agent made several attempts to deploy a Lab at Position(0.5, 2.5) for supplying Automation Science Packs to research, but these placements failed.  \n\u2022 While the agent did retrieve existing smelting facilities\u2014a furnace at Position(5.0, 5.0) used for converting iron ore (with coal) into iron plates and a copper furnace at Position(\u201327.0, \u201360.0) used for processing copper ore into copper plates\u2014these were not constructed by the agent and remain part of the pre\u2010existing environment.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 Correct API Usage for Entity Retrieval  \n\u2003\u2013 When using get_entities, ensure that the call matches its expected signature. Errors arose both from using an unexpected keyword argument (\u2018radius\u2019) and from providing extra positional arguments. Verify the API documentation and use only the supported parameters.\n\n\u2022 Handling Null Returns  \n\u2003\u2013 When filtering retrieved entities (for example, lab instances), check whether the result is None before iterating. Using a fallback (such as an empty list) helps avoid TypeErrors from attempting to iterate over a NoneType.\n\n\u2022 Validating Placement Conditions  \n\u2003\u2013 Before attempting to place a structure, confirm that the required inventory item (in this case, a Lab) is present. Also ensure that the target position is valid and unoccupied to avoid placement errors.\n\n\u2022 Ensuring Crafting Prerequisites  \n\u2003\u2013 The lab crafting errors indicate missing sub-ingredients (such as iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, and copper-cables). Prior to crafting complex items, verify that all necessary intermediate components are either available or can be produced via the appropriate production chain (e.g., furnaces or assembling machines)."}
