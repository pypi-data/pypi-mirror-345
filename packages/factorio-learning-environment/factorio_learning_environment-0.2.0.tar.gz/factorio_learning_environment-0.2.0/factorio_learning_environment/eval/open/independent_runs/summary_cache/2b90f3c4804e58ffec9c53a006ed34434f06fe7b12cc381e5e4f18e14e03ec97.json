{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) extracting iron ore, with a drop position at (-14.5, -48.5).\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-15.5, -48.5) and (-14.5, -48.5) for temporary storage of extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5) transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-14.5, -47.5) transferring iron ore from the chest to another chest at (-14.5, -46.5).\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -46.5) storing iron ore and iron plates.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-6.5, -49.5), (-6.5, -48.5), (-5.5, -48.5), (-4.5, -48.5), (-3.5, -48.5), and (-7.5, -48.5) storing iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-8.5, -47.5) waiting for source items, connected to the storage chests.\n\n### Additional Furnaces\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-10.0, -48.0) with no ingredients to smelt, indicating a potential setup for future expansion of the smelting process.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entity has items available for the inserter to pick up. Regularly check and realign inserters if necessary to maintain efficient item transfer.\n\n### Refueling and Resource Management\n- Maintain a sufficient supply of coal in the inventory to refuel mining drills and furnaces to prevent interruptions in production. Regularly check fuel levels and replenish as needed.\n\n### Error When Inserting Items Without Inventory Stock\n- Before attempting to insert items into an entity, ensure that the required items are available in your inventory to prevent errors and interruptions in the production process."}
