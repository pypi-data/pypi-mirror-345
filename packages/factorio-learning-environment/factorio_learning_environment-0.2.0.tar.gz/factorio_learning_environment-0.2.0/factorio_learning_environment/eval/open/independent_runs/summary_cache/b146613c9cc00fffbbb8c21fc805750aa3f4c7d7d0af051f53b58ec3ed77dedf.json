{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Mining and Smelting Operation at (15.5, 70.5)\n- **Electric mining drill** at (16.5, 70.5) extracting iron ore (currently offline due to power issues)\n- **Stone furnace** at (16.0, 73.0) smelting iron plates (currently idle due to no input)\n- Power connection issues present (see error tips)\n\n#### Copper Mining and Smelting Operation at (-46.5, 70.5)\n- **Electric mining drill** at (-46.5, 70.5) extracting copper ore (status unknown)\n- **Stone furnace** at (-46.0, 73.0) smelting copper plates (currently idle due to no input)\n- **Burner inserter** at (-45.5, 71.5) transferring items (waiting for source items)\n\n#### Coal Mining Operation at (15.5, -0.5)\n- **Electric mining drill** at (15.5, -0.5) extracting coal (output blocked by full chest)\n- **Wooden chest** at (15.5, 1.5) full of coal (needs emptying)\n- Power connection issues present\n\n#### Partial Power Generation System at (-9.5, -1.5)\n- **Offshore pump** at (-9.5, -1.5) with connection issues (status: NOT_CONNECTED)\n- **Boiler** at (-8.0, -0.5) with connection issues (status: NOT_CONNECTED)\n- Partial pipe network present but non-functional:\n  - Water pipes from (-8.5, -0.5) to (-4.5, 1.5)\n  - No operational steam engine currently connected\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Entity Placement Issues\n- Repeated placement attempts on water tiles (boiler at (-11.0,2.0), steam engine at (-3.5,-0.5)). Always verify terrain is land before placement.\n- Multiple placement collisions (steam engine at (-7.5,-0.5), boiler at (-8.0,0.0)). Clear target area completely before placement.\n\n#### Fluid System Connection Problems\n- Failed boiler-to-pump connections due to blocked connection points. Verify clear path between fluid entities.\n- Steam engine placement attempts without proper boiler alignment. Ensure 2-space gap between boiler and engine.\n\n#### Power System Configuration\n- Mining drills show \"NO_POWER\" status despite pole connections. Verify complete power network connectivity.\n- Offshore pump shows \"NOT_CONNECTED\" status. Ensure proper water pipe connections from pump output.\n\n#### Operational Warnings\n- Persistent \"chest full\" warnings at (15.5,1.5). Empty output containers regularly to maintain production.\n- Furnaces show \"NO_INGREDIENTS\" status. Verify ore supply chains are functioning.\n\n#### Inventory Management\n- Declining counts of key power system components (boilers, steam engines). Monitor inventory levels before construction attempts.\n- Throughput dropping to zero indicates critical production chain failures. Prioritize fixing power and fluid systems."}
