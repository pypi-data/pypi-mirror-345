{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report (Steps 24-31)\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Functional Power Plant at (-9.5, 0.5)\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, 0.5) facing right\n- Boiler at (-7.0, 1.5) facing right (currently out of fuel)\n- Steam engine at (-2.5, 1.5) facing right (not connected to power network)\n- Connected with water pipes between pump and boiler\n- Connected with steam pipes between boiler and engine\n- Small electric pole at (-2.5, 3.5) (power network issues)\n\n### Smelting and Production Area\n- Iron smelting furnace at (5.0, 0.0) (contains 14 iron ore, 50 coal)\n- Copper smelting furnace at (5.0, 4.0) (contains 14 copper ore, 36 coal)\n- Gear assembler at (8.5, 0.5) (no power, missing iron plates)\n- Cable assembler at (8.5, 4.5) (no power, missing copper plates)\n- Science assembler at (12.5, 2.5) (no power, missing inputs)\n- Power poles present but network not functioning properly\n\n### Transport Infrastructure\n- Iron plate inserter at (6.5, 0.5) facing right (no power)\n- Copper plate inserter at (6.5, 4.5) facing right (no power)\n- Gear output inserter at (10.5, 0.5) facing left (no power)\n- Multiple failed attempts to place transport belts at (7.5, 0.5) and (7.5, 4.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Power system failures\n- Boiler is out of fuel - regularly check and refuel power generation components\n- Steam engine not connected to power network - verify all power pole connections\n- Multiple machines showing \"no power\" status - fix power generation first before addressing other issues\n\n### Entity placement errors\n- Repeated attempts to place belts at occupied positions (7.5, 0.5) and (7.5, 4.5)\n  - Always check for existing entities before placement\n  - Remove blocking entities first if replacement is needed\n- Attempted placement from too far away (distance 87.8 when max is 10)\n  - Move character close to build location before placing entities\n\n### Production chain issues\n- Multiple machines showing ingredient shortages:\n  - Verify raw material supply (mining \u2192 furnaces \u2192 assemblers)\n  - Check transport connections between each production step\n- Furnaces have fuel but some assemblers lack power - prioritize fixing power network\n\n### Inventory management\n- Attempted to insert iron ore without having any - always verify inventory before insertion\n- Collected resources (iron/copper ore) but didn't deliver to furnaces - complete the transport chain\n\n### General troubleshooting\n- Address power issues first as they affect all other operations\n- Fix one production line completely before moving to others\n- Check entity status messages systematically from raw materials to final product"}
