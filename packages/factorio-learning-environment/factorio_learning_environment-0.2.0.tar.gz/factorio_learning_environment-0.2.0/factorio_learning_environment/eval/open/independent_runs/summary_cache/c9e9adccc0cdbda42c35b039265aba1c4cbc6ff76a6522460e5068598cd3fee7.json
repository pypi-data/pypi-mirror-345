{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Processing Facility at position (-10.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-10.0, -50.0) used for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n  - Current status: No ingredients to smelt.\n  - Fuel: Coal (10 units remaining).\n\n### Electricity Generator at position (-9.5, 24.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5) used to pump water.\n- Boiler at position (-4.5, 25.0) used to heat water for steam production.\n  - Current status: Not connected, out of fuel, no input liquid.\n  - Connection points: [-6.5, 25.5], [-2.5, 25.5].\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to crafting without required materials\n- Ensure all required sub-ingredients are available in the inventory before attempting to craft items. For example, crafting an offshore pump requires iron plates and electronic circuits, which in turn require copper cables and copper plates.\n\n### Errors when placing entities without having them in inventory\n- Verify that the entity you wish to place is present in your inventory before attempting to place it on the map.\n\n### Errors due to being too far from the target placement position\n- Move closer to the target position when placing entities. The maximum distance allowed is 10 units.\n\n### Smelting errors due to missing inputs or fuel\n- Regularly check the Stone Furnace for sufficient fuel and input materials to avoid smelting timeouts. Ensure that both the fuel and the ore are inserted into the furnace.\n\n### Assertion errors due to missing inventory items\n- Before executing operations that depend on specific inventory items, such as smelting, confirm that the necessary items (e.g., Copper Ore) are available in the inventory.\n\n### Errors when extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing. Check for obstructions or unplaceable terrain like water.\n\n### Type errors when using API\n- Ensure that the parameters being passed to functions are of the correct type. For example, converting attributes to integers should be done with valid numeric values."}
