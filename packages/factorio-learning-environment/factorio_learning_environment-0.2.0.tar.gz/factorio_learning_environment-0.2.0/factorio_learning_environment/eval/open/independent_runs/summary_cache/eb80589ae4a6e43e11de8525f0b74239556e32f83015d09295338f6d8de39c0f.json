{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining System at Position(41.0, -85.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill mining coal\n- Burner inserter at (42.5, -83.5) moving coal from drill to storage\n- Wooden chest at (43.5, -83.5) storing coal\n\n### Iron Production System 1 at Position(-20.0, -54.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill mining iron ore\n- Stone furnace at (-19.0, -52.0) smelting iron plates\n\n### Iron Production System 2 at Position(-14.0, -56.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill mining iron ore\n- Stone furnace at (-13.0, -54.0) smelting iron plates\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Errors\n- When placing transport belts, ensure the target location is clear and not on unplaceable terrain (like water)\n- When placing inserters next to entities, ensure:\n  - There is enough space between entities\n  - The reference position and direction are compatible with existing structures\n  - No other entities are blocking the placement position\n  - The spacing parameter is appropriate for the setup\n\n### Resource Management\n- Ensure sufficient coal is available in inventory before attempting to insert it into entities\n- Monitor fuel levels in burner devices to maintain continuous operation\n\n### System Design Issues\n- Iron production systems are showing \"output blocked\" warnings due to items on ground\n- Consider implementing proper item transport between components to prevent blockages\n- Ensure proper sink entities are in place to accept outputs from mining drills\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nFunctions:\n- place_entity(): Places entities at specific coordinates\n- place_entity_next_to(): Places entities adjacent to existing ones with specified spacing and direction\n- insert_item(): Transfers items from inventory to entities\n- extract_item(): Removes items from entities to inventory\n\nImportant Variables:\n- EntityStatus: Enum tracking entity operational states (WORKING, WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS, NO_INGREDIENTS)\n- Direction: Enum for entity orientations (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT)\n- Position: Class representing x,y coordinates\n- Inventory: Class managing item storage for entities"}
