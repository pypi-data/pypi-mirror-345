{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Iron Ore Mine at position(x=52.5, y=-82.5)\nConsists of a wooden chest at position(x=52.5, y=-82.5) containing 121 iron plates.\n\n### Furnace at position(x=52.0, y=-80.0)\nConsists of a stone furnace at position(x=52.0, y=-80.0) with 50 coal as fuel, and a burner inserter at position(x=53.5, y=-78.5) connected to a transport belt.\n\n### Furnace at position(x=62.0, y=-54.0)\nConsists of a stone furnace at position(x=62.0, y=-54.0) with 50 coal as fuel.\n\n### Belt Group at position(x=51.5, y=-84.5)\nConsists of a belt group with 7 belts, connecting the iron ore mine to the furnace at position(x=52.0, y=-80.0), with 22 coal in inventory.\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n* **Errors when inserting items into a full inventory**: Ensure that the inventory is not full before attempting to insert items. In this case, the furnace at position(x=52.0, y=-80.0) had a full fuel source, causing the error.\n* **Undefined functions**: Define functions before using them. In this case, the `setup_mining_operation` function was not defined, causing a NameError.\n* **Incorrect use of built-in functions**: Use built-in functions correctly. In this case, the `builtins` module was not imported, causing a NameError.\n\n# NAMESPACE\n* **Utility functions**:\n\t+ None defined\n* **Important variables**:\n\t+ `transport-belt`: int (150)\n\t+ `burner-inserter`: int (9)\n\t+ `burner-mining-drill`: int (1)\n\t+ `wood`: int (2)\n\t+ `coal`: int (1134)\n\t+ `stone`: int (5)\n\t+ `iron-ore`: int (178)"}
