Check for any entities blocking the path or incorrect alignment of belts.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Verify that the source items are available for the inserter to pick up. Ensure that the supply chain is complete and that there are no missing resources.\n\n### Transport Belt Blockage\n- Clear the transport belt at the drop position to avoid blockage. Ensure that the belt path is clear and that there is space for items to be transported.\n\n### Out of Fuel for Burner Mining Drill\n- Regularly check and refuel the burner mining drill to maintain continuous operation. Ensure a steady supply of fuel to prevent downtime."}
