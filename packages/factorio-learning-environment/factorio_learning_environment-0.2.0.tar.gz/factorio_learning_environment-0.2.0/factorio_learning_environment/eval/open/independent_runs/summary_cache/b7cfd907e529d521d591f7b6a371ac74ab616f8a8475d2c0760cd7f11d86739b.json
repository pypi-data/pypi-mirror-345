{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Complex at position(-10.0, -59.0)\nConsists of three burner mining drills in a row (currently out of fuel):\n- Burner mining drill at (-10.0, -59.0) connected to wooden chest at (-9.5, -57.5)\n- Burner mining drill at (-8.0, -59.0) connected to wooden chest at (-7.5, -57.5)\n- Burner mining drill at (-6.0, -59.0) connected to wooden chest at (-5.5, -57.5)\n\n### Copper/Iron Processing Line at position(-28.0, -61.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-28.0, -61.0)\n- Stone furnace at (-27.0, -59.0)\n- Burner inserter at (-28.5, -58.5) feeding into furnace\n- Wooden chest at (-24.5, -58.5) for output storage\n- Burner inserter at (-25.5, -58.5) moving items from furnace to chest\n\n### Smelting Array at position(0.0, 0.0)\nFour parallel smelting lines, each consisting of:\n1. Input wooden chests at y=-2.5 positions (0.5, 2.5, 4.5, 6.5)\n2. Burner inserters at y=-1.5 feeding furnaces\n3. Stone furnaces at y=0.0 positions (0.0, 2.0, 4.0, 6.0)\n4. Burner inserters at y=1.5 moving output\n5. Output wooden chests at y=2.5 storing iron plates\n\n### Additional Smelting Setup at position(-23.0, -58.0)\nConsists of:\n- Two stone furnaces at (-23.0, -58.0) and (-21.0, -58.0)\n- Multiple burner inserters for material movement\n- Output wooden chest at (-22.5, -55.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when attempting direct belt connections\n- Cannot connect belts directly to stone furnaces - use inserters instead\n- Cannot connect belts directly from wooden chests - use inserters instead\n- Always use inserters as intermediaries when moving items between storage/processing entities\n\n### Entity Status Issues\n- Multiple burner mining drills are out of fuel - ensure coal supply is maintained\n- Several furnaces have no ingredients to smelt - verify input material flow\n- Many inserters are waiting for source items - check the supply chain for bottlenecks"}
