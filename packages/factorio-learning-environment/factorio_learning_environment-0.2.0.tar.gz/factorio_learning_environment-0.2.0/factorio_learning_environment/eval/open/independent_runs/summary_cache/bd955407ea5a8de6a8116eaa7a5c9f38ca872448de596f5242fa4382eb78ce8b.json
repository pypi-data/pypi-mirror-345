{"content": "# Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-16.0, -51.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (3 units)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Warnings: Output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Drop Position: (-16.5, -52.5)\n  - Resources: Iron Ore (40,000 units)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-14.0, -49.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (14 units)\n  - Status: No Ingredients\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Furnace Result: Iron Plate (60 units)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied or invalid locations\n- Ensure that the tile is free and suitable for placing the desired entity before attempting placement. This includes checking for other entities or items that might be occupying the space.\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities from incorrect positions\n- Verify the position of the entity before attempting to retrieve it. Ensure that the coordinates are correct and that an entity of the expected type exists at that location.\n\n### Errors related to blocked outputs\n- Ensure there is a sink entity (such as a chest or belt) in place to accept the output from production entities like drills and furnaces to prevent blockage.\n\n### Errors when placing entities without checking for obstructions\n- Before placing entities like transport belts or inserters, make sure the path is clear and there are no obstructions that could prevent placement.\n\n### Errors due to missing ingredients in production entities\n- Regularly check that production entities like furnaces have the necessary ingredients to process. Ensure a steady supply of resources to prevent idle time."}
