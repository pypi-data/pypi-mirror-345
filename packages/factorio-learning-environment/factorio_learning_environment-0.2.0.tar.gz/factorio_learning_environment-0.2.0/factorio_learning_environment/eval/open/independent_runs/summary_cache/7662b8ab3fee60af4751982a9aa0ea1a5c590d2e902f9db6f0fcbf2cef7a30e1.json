{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Setup at (-10, -59)\nConsists of following entities:\n- 3 Burner mining drills in a row at positions (-10, -59), (-8, -59), (-6, -59)\n- 3 Wooden chests at positions (-9.5, -57.5), (-7.5, -57.5), (-5.5, -57.5) collecting iron ore\n- Mining drills are connected to share resources, with middle drill having fuel (coal)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line at (0, 0)\nConsists of following entities:\n- 4 Stone furnaces in a row at positions (0, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (6, 0)\n- 4 Input burner inserters at positions (0.5, -1.5), (2.5, -1.5), (4.5, -1.5), (6.5, -1.5)\n- 4 Coal storage chests at positions (0.5, -2.5), (2.5, -2.5), (4.5, -2.5), (6.5, -2.5)\n- 4 Output wooden chests at positions (0.5, 2.5), (2.5, 1.5), (4.5, 1.5), (6.5, 1.5)\n- 1 Output burner inserter at position (0.5, 1.5) moving iron plates to chest\n- Furnaces contain varying amounts of coal as fuel and iron plates in output\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing inserters in occupied spaces\n- Check if the target position is already occupied by another entity before placing inserters\n- Ensure there is enough clearance around furnaces and other structures when planning inserter placement\n- Consider the tile dimensions of existing entities when calculating inserter positions\n- Use entity neighbor data to verify available space for new entity placement"}
