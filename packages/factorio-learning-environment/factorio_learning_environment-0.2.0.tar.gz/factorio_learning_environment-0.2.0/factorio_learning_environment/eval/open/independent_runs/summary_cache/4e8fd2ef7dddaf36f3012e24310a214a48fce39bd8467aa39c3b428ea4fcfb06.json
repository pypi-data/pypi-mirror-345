{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore from the resource patch.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Setup\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items from the chest to the furnace. Repeated checks indicate that the furnace is not receiving iron ore, suggesting misalignment or incorrect setup.\n\n### Fuel Management Errors\n- Regularly check fuel levels for all entities that require fuel, such as the burner mining drill and inserter. There were instances where the mining drill and inserter ran out of fuel, halting operations.\n\n### Inventory Management\n- Monitor the inventory of the chest to prevent it from becoming full, which can stop the mining drill from operating. Extract iron ore from the chest regularly to maintain space for new resources.\n\n### Furnace Operation Errors\n- Ensure that the furnace receives the necessary ingredients (iron ore) to function. The furnace status indicates \"no ingredients to smelt,\" suggesting that the inserter is not effectively transferring iron ore to the furnace."}
