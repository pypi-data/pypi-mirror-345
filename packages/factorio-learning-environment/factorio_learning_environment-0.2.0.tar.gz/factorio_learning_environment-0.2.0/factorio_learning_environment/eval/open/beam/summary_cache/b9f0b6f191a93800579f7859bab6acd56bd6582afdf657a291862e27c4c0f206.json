{"content": "Let me analyze the interaction with the Factorio API:\n\nReport on API Interaction:\n\n1. What we attempted to achieve:\n- Goal: Craft a stone furnace\n- Process: Find stone -> Mine stone -> Craft furnace\n- Initial error: Tried to craft stone furnace without raw stone\n- Final success: Successfully mined stone and crafted the furnace\n\n2. Key errors encountered:\n- Initially tried to craft stone directly (not possible as it's a raw resource)\n- Learned that stone must be harvested first\n- Had to use harvest_resource() instead of trying to craft stone\n\n3. Successful patterns:\n```python\n# Pattern for gathering raw resources:\nresource_pos = nearest(Resource.Stone)  # Find resource\nmove_to(resource_pos)                   # Move to it\nharvest_resource(resource_pos, quantity=n)  # Gather it\n\n# Pattern for crafting:\nif inventory.get(Prototype.Stone, 0) >= 5:  # Check requirements\n    craft_item(Prototype.StoneFurnace)      # Craft if possible\n```\n\n4. Tips for future API use:\n- Always check inventory before crafting\n- Remember raw resources (like stone) must be gathered, not crafted\n- Use harvest_resource() for raw materials\n- The nearest() function is useful for finding resources\n- Always move_to() before harvesting\n- Keep track of quantities needed for recipes\n\n5. Outcome:\n- Successfully gathered 10 stone\n- Crafted 1 stone furnace\n- Had 5 stone remaining in inventory\n- Process worked as intended once we understood the raw resource requirement\n\nThis interaction helped establish a clear pattern for gathering resources and crafting items in the correct order.", "summary_range": "[1-2464]"}
