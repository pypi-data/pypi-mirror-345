{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Complex at (-10, -59)\nConsists of three mining and smelting units:\n- Burner mining drill at (-10, -59) with furnace at (-9, -57)\n- Burner mining drill at (-8, -59) with furnace at (-7, -57)\n- Burner mining drill at (-6, -59) with furnace at (-5, -57)\nAll drills and furnaces are operational and fueled with coal\n\n### Automated Smelting Line at (0, 0)\nComplex smelting setup with:\n- 4 stone furnaces at positions (0,0), (2,0), (4,0), and (6,0)\n- 4 wooden chests with coal at (0.5,-2.5), (2.5,-2.5), (4.5,-2.5), and (6.5,-2.5)\n- 4 burner inserters at (0.5,-1.5), (2.5,-1.5), (4.5,-1.5), and (6.5,-1.5) moving coal from chests to furnaces\n- Output collection system:\n  - 4 wooden chests at (0.5,2.5), (2.5,1.5), (4.5,1.5), and (6.5,1.5)\n  - Burner inserters at (0.5,1.5) and (7.5,0.5) moving products to storage chests\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Mining Output Blockage Issues\n- Mining drills are showing \"output blocked by item on ground\" warnings\n- Need to ensure proper item collection from mining drill output positions\n- Consider adding inserters or transport belts to move items from drill output positions to furnaces\n\n### Furnace Placement Precision\n- When placing furnaces to collect from mining drills, ensure they are positioned exactly at the drill's drop position\n- Current setup required multiple adjustments to align furnaces with drill outputs\n\n### Entity Connection Issues\n- Make sure entities that need to interact (like inserters moving items between buildings) are properly aligned and within reach of each other\n- Check pickup and drop positions of inserters match with the input/output positions of connected entities\n\n### Resource Management\n- Some furnaces show \"no ingredients to smelt\" warnings\n- Ensure consistent material flow between connected entities\n- Monitor fuel levels in burner devices to maintain continuous operation"}
