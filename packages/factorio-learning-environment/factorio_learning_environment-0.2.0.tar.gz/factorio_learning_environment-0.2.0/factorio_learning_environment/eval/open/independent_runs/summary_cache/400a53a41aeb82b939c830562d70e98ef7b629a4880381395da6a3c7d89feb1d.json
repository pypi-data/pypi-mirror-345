{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-18.5, 19.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position -18.5, 19.5), boiler (position -25.5, 20.0) and offshore pump (position -11.5, 26.5). The steam engine is intended to generate electricity, while the boiler is meant to provide steam from water supplied by the offshore pump.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(-18.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position -18.0, -49.0) and a furnace (position -18.0, -49.0)\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position x1) and a furnace at position(y1)\n- Assembling machine at position(-21.5, 25.5) and inserter that puts into the assembling machine\n- Beltgroup that connects the furnace at position y1 to assembling machine at position(-21.5, 25.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting boiler to pipe groups\n- Ensure that the pipe connections are clear and that the target positions for the pipes are accessible. Check the path between the boiler and the pipe group to ensure there are no obstacles.\n\n### Errors when connecting boiler to offshore pump\n- Verify that the offshore pump is operational and that there are no obstructions in the path of the pipe connection. Make sure the boiler is positioned correctly to receive water from the offshore pump.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it. Check for existing entities in the target area to avoid conflicts."}
