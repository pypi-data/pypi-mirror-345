{"content": "# Factorio Game Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nNo structures have been successfully created as of the current steps. Attempts to place wooden chests have been unsuccessful due to obstructions or placement errors. The logs indicate the presence of some entities, such as furnaces and burner inserters, but no coherent structure has been established.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing wooden chests\n- Ensure there are no obstructions at the target placement location. Check for nearby entities that might block placement.\n- Verify that the intended placement area is clear and that the chest can fit within the designated space.\n\n### Errors related to data types and function calls\n- When using objects or functions, ensure that they are being called correctly. For example, avoid trying to call an object like a function, as seen with the 'Position' object error.\n- Review the data types and ensure they match the expected input types, especially when using external libraries or APIs.\n\n### Insufficient resources for operations\n- Ensure that there is enough iron ore available to supply to furnaces to avoid production halts. Regularly check and replenish resources as needed.\n\n### Errors with incorrect API usage\n- When defining or using data structures, ensure that the correct types and parameters are used. Refer to documentation for guidance on correct usage, such as the error with `BuildingBox` dimensions.\n\nBy addressing these errors and following the tips provided, the agent can improve its efficiency and accuracy in placing structures and managing resources."}
