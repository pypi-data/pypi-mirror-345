Use the `find_buildable_area` function to locate valid positions.\n\n#### Errors due to undefined variables\n- The variable `central_storage` is referenced but not defined. Ensure all variables are properly initialized before use. Consider using `central_storage_pos` or `new_storage_pos` instead.\n\n#### Errors when attempting to move or interact with non-existent entities\n- Before interacting with an entity (e.g., moving a furnace), verify its existence at the specified position using `get_entity`.\n\n#### Repeated placement attempts in invalid locations\n- Avoid repeatedly attempting to place entities in the same invalid positions. Use a systematic approach to find and validate buildable areas before placement.\n\n#### Errors when inserting fuel into drills\n- Ensure drills have sufficient fuel to operate. Use inserters or manually insert coal into drills to keep them running.\n\n#### Errors when placing central storage chests\n- Central storage chests require a valid, unoccupied position. Use the `find_buildable_area` function to locate suitable positions before placement."}
