{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining Station at (-14.0, -15.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (x=24.0, y=-15.0)\n- Storage chest (x=23.5, y=-16.5)\nMining coal with 184 coal stored in chest.\n\n### Iron Mining Station at (-14.0, 23.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (x=-14.0, y=23.0)\n- Storage chest (x=-14.5, y=21.5)\nMining iron ore with 698 iron ore stored in chest.\n\n### Copper Mining and Processing Line at (20.0, 20.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (x=20.0, y=20.0) with storage chest (x=20.5, y=21.5)\n- Intermediate storage chest (x=22.5, y=21.5) containing 413 copper ore\n- Stone furnace (x=24.0, y=20.0)\n- Output chest (x=24.5, y=17.5) containing 53 copper plates\n- Input inserter (x=23.5, y=21.5) connecting middle chest to furnace\n- Output inserter (x=24.5, y=18.5) connecting furnace to output chest\n\n### Iron Processing Station at (-10.0, 20.0)\nConsists of:\n- Two stone furnaces (x=-11.0, y=20.0 and x=-9.0, y=20.0)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Incorrect Inserter Placement and Configuration\n- When placing inserters, ensure proper alignment between pickup and drop positions\n- Multiple attempts were made to fix inserter positions (at x=22.5,y=20.5 and x=23.5,y=21.5)\n- Verify the inserter's rotation and position relative to both source and destination before placement\n\n### Resource Management Issues\n- Mining drill at (20.0, 20.0) has run out of fuel - ensure consistent fuel supply to all machines\n- Furnaces show NO_INGREDIENTS status despite available ore - check inserter configurations and connections\n\n### Machine Efficiency\n- Multiple furnaces are idle with no ingredients despite available resources\n- Ensure proper connection between storage, transport, and processing facilities"}
