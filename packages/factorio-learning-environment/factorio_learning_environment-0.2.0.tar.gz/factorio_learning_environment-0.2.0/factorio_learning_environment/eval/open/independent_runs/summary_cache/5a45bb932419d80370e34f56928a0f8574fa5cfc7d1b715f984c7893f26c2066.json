{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-10.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-10.0, -50.0) used for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserters** at positions (-10.5, -48.5), (-7.5, -49.5), and (-5.5, -49.5) used to insert fuel and materials into the furnace.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-8.5, -49.5) used for storing materials.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Facility at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-14.0, -53.0) used for extracting iron ore.\n- **Transport Belts** connecting the mining drill to other entities, facilitating the movement of extracted materials.\n\n### Belt Networks\n- **BeltGroup**: Multiple belt groups are present, connecting various parts of the mining and production facilities. These belts are used to transport materials between different entities.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Belts Directly to Non-Belt Entities\n- Ensure that belts are connected to an inserter when transferring items to or from non-belt entities like furnaces or chests. Direct connections are not supported and will result in errors.\n\n### Errors due to Insufficient Inventory Items\n- Always verify that you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities. For example, ensure you have enough coal before trying to refuel a furnace or inserter.\n\n### General Tips for Efficient Production\n- Investigate and address the low iron plate production by checking for bottlenecks in the supply chain, ensuring all entities are adequately fueled, and that there are no blockages in the belt networks."}
