{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper plate factory at position(0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace (position (2.0, 0.0)) that produces copper plates\n- Furnace (position (0.0, 0.0)) that produces iron plates\n- Chest (position (3.5, 0.5)) that stores copper plates\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when crafting automation science packs\n- Ensure you have enough copper plates available, as they are required to craft automation science packs. If you lack the necessary crafting machines or furnaces to produce copper plates, prioritize setting those up.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it."}
