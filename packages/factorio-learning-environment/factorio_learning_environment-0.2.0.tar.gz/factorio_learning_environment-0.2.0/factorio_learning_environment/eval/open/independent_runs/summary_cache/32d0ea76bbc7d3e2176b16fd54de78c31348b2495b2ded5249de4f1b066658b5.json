{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Setup at position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) which extracts iron ore and places it into a chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5) that stores extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5) which is intended to transfer iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0) which is supposed to smelt the iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities too far away\n- Ensure you are within the maximum distance (10 tiles) when placing entities. Move closer to the target position before attempting to place an entity.\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied tiles\n- Before placing an entity, verify that the target tile is not occupied by another entity. Consider adjusting the spacing, changing the direction, or selecting a different reference position to avoid collisions.\n\n### Inserter setup issues\n- Check that the inserter is correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items between entities. Ensure it is refueled and has a clear path for item transfer.\n\n### Chest management\n- Regularly check and manage the inventory of chests to prevent them from becoming full, which can halt production processes."}
