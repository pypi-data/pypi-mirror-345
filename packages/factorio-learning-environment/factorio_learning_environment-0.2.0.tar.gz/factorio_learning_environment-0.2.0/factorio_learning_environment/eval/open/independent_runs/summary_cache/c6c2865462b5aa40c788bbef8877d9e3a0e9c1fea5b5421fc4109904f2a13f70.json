(New instance at step 73)\n* Errors when attempting to place entities without having them in inventory:\n  - Ensure you have the required entity in your inventory before attempting to place it. (New instances at steps 74, 78)\n* Errors when attempting to get an entity at a position where it does not exist:\n  - Ensure an entity of the specified type exists at the target position before attempting to retrieve it. (New instance at step 79)\n\n### NAMESPACE\n* Important variables:\n  - `furnace_iron`: Furnace entity, type: `Entity`\n  - `entity`: Entity object, type: `Entity`\n  - `to`: Unknown type, possibly an entity or position\n  - `drill_iron`: Electric mining drill entity, type: `Entity`\n  - `inserter_iron`: Inserter entity, type: `Entity`\n  - `assembler_gear`: Assembling machine entity, type: `Entity`\n* Utility functions:\n  - `insert_item(item_type: `Prototype`, target: `Entity`, quantity: `int`) -> `Entity`: Inserts a specified quantity of an item into a target entity. \n    - Failure modes: \n      - `Exception: Could not insert: No iron-ore to insert from your inventory` when there are insufficient resources in the inventory. \n    - Success modes: \n      - Successfully inserts the specified quantity of the item into the target entity when there are sufficient resources.\n  - `connect_entities(entity1: `Entity`, entity2: `Entity`, prototype: `Prototype`) -> `Entity`: Connects two entities using a specified prototype.\n    - Failure modes:\n      - `Exception: Transport belts cannot be connected directly to a Prototype.StoneFurnace object as a target.` when attempting to connect a transport belt directly to a furnace. \n      - `Exception: Cannot connect"}
