{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(1.5, 3.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Electric pole (position (1.5, 3.5)) \n- Electric pole (position (6.5, 3.5))\n- Electric pole (position (6.5, 4.5))\n- Electric pole (position (2.5, 1.5))\n\n### Stone furnace at position(1.0, 1.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position (1.0, 1.0)) with fuel: coal (12) and status: WORKING\n- Chest (position (3.5, 1.5)) containing iron plates (20)\n- Chest (position (3.5, 3.5)) containing iron plates (50)\n- Chest (position (3.5, 5.5)) empty\n\n### Lab at position(3.5, 3.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab (position (3.5, 3.5)) with status: NO_POWER\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to electric poles\n- Ensure that electric poles are placed in positions that are not obstructed by other entities. Check for existing objects in the way before placing a new electric pole.\n\n### Errors when trying to connect to power sources\n- Verify that the electric poles are properly connected to the electric network. If an electric pole is showing as NOT_PLUGGED_IN_ELECTRIC_NETWORK, check the surrounding connections and ensure there are no obstructions.\n\n### Errors with lab connections\n- Ensure that the lab has a power source connected to it. If the lab status is NO_POWER, check the connections to the nearest electric pole.\n\n### Attribute errors\n- Be cautious of using attributes that may not exist on objects. For example, ensure that the object you are referencing actually has the attributes you are trying to access, such as 'voltage' in the ElectricityGroup.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity on a tile before attempting to place it. If an error occurs indicating that the position is not suitable, check for existing entities in that location."}
