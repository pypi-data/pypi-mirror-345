{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0), extracting iron ore and dropping it at position (-14.5, -48.5).\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -48.0), smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-14.5, -46.5), transferring iron ore from the mining drill to the furnace.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-12.5, -47.5), transferring iron plates from the furnace to the wooden chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-11.5, -47.5), storing iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Misalignment of Inserters\n- Ensure that the pickup and drop positions of inserters are correctly aligned with the source and destination entities. Misalignment can prevent the inserter from functioning correctly.\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities on Occupied Tiles\n- Before placing an entity, verify that the target tile is unoccupied. If another entity is present, consider adjusting the spacing or changing the direction to avoid overlap.\n\n### Errors with Placing Entities at a Distance\n- Move closer to the target position before attempting to place an entity. Ensure that you are within the maximum allowable distance to place entities effectively.\n\n### Errors due to Lack of Inventory Items\n- Ensure that the required items are available in your inventory before attempting to place them. If an item is missing, craft or acquire it first.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Check that the source entity has the necessary items for the inserter to transfer. If the source is empty, ensure it is being supplied with the required resources."}
