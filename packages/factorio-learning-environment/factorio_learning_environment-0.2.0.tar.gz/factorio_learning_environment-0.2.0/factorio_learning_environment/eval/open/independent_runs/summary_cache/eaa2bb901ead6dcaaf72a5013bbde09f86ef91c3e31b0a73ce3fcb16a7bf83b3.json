{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining Operation at (-15, -15)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (24.0, -15.0)\n- Wooden chest at (23.5, -16.5) for coal collection\nCurrent status: Working, mining coal with 14 fuel remaining\n\n### Iron Mining Operation at (-14, 23)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-14.0, 23.0)\n- Wooden chest at (-14.5, 21.5) for iron ore collection\nCurrent status: Working, mining iron ore with 23 fuel remaining\n\n### Copper Mining and Processing Line at (20, 20)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (20.0, 20.0) mining copper ore\n- Collection chest at (20.5, 21.5) for initial copper ore storage\n- Secondary chest at (22.5, 21.5) with 393 copper ore\n- Stone furnace at (24.0, 20.0)\n- Burner inserter at (22.5, 20.5) moving ore from chest to furnace\n- Output chest at (24.5, 17.5) containing 53 copper plates\n- Output inserter at (24.5, 18.5) moving plates from furnace to output chest\n\n### Unused Furnace Setup\nTwo idle stone furnaces at:\n- (-11.0, 20.0)\n- (-9.0, 20.0)\nBoth have 23 coal fuel but no ingredients\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Incorrect Variable Reference\n- When referencing entity types like BurnerMiningDrill, use the correct import or full path (entities.BurnerMiningDrill)\n\n### Furnace Efficiency Issues\n- Furnaces are showing NO_INGREDIENTS status despite available ore in nearby chests\n- Verify inserter pickup and drop positions are correctly aligned with input/output positions of furnaces\n- Check that inserters have proper orientation to move materials between chests and furnaces\n\n### Resource Management\n- Monitor fuel levels in mining drills and inserters regularly\n- Consider setting up automated fuel delivery systems for continuous operation\n- Some furnaces have excess fuel (50 coal) while others are lower - balance fuel distribution"}
