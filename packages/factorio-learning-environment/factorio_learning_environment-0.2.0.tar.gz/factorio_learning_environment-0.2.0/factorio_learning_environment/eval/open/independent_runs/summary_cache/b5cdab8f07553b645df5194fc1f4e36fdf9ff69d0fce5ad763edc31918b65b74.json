{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll summarize the structures and error tips:\n\n# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line at (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-15.0, -50.0) facing down, mining iron ore\n- Burner inserter at (-14.5, -48.5) to transfer ore from drill to furnace\n- Stone furnace at (-14.0, -47.0) for smelting iron ore into plates\n\nThe structure is set up as a production line with:\n- Mining drill extracting iron ore\n- Inserter moving ore from drill to furnace\n- Furnace smelting ore into plates\nAll components have been fueled with coal.\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with entity placement spacing and collisions\n- When placing entities next to each other, ensure proper spacing to avoid collisions\n- Consider the entity dimensions and required gaps between them\n- Use appropriate spacing parameters when placing entities next to each other\n\n### Errors with missing fuel/materials\n- Ensure required fuel (coal) is in inventory before attempting to insert it into entities\n- Check inventory contents before attempting to insert items into entities\n\n### Errors with recipe ingredients\n- Some items like iron plates cannot be crafted directly and require smelting in a furnace\n- Verify recipe requirements and use appropriate production method (direct crafting vs smelting)\n\n### Errors with entity attributes access\n- Cannot directly add entity dimensions/attributes, need to access the actual values rather than the attribute references\n- Use proper methods to access entity properties rather than direct attribute manipulation\n\n### Errors with entity placement direction\n- Consider entity output direction when placing in production lines\n- Ensure entities are properly oriented to connect with each other"}
