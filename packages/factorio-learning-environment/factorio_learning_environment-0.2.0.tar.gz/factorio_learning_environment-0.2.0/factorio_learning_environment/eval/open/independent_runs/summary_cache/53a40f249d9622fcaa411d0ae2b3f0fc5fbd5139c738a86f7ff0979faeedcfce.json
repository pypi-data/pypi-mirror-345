{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (0.0, 0.0) and (2.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace 1 at position (0.0, 0.0) with a status of FULL_OUTPUT, containing 100 iron plates and fueled by coal.\n- Furnace 2 at position (2.0, 0.0) with a status of FULL_OUTPUT, containing 100 iron plates and fueled by coal.\n\n### Coal Mining and Distribution System at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) extracting coal, connected to:\n  - Wooden Chest at position (40.5, -83.5) storing coal.\n  - Burner Inserter 1 at position (41.5, -83.5) transferring coal to a Wooden Chest at position (42.5, -83.5).\n  - Burner Inserter 2 at position (41.5, -80.5) transferring coal to a Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -79.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (42.5, -83.5) containing 59 units of coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -79.5) containing 639 units of coal.\n- BeltGroup transporting coal from position (42.5, -83.5) to (45.5, -83.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entity has items available for the inserter to pick up. This can be resolved by ensuring the mining drill or any other source entity is operational and producing output.\n\n### Furnace Result is Full\n- Regularly remove items from the furnace output to prevent it from becoming full and halting production. Consider using inserters to automate the transfer of items from the furnace to a storage chest or conveyor belt.\n\n### Efficient Resource Distribution\n- Ensure that the distribution of resources such as coal is balanced and that all necessary entities are adequately fueled to maintain continuous operation."}
