Consider adjusting the position or direction if placement fails due to existing objects.\n\n### Errors with inserter placement\n- Verify that there is enough space and the correct direction for inserter placement. Adjust spacing or direction if necessary.\n\n### Errors when managing storage chests\n- Ensure that the storage chest is not full before attempting to extract or manage items from it. Consider emptying the chest to continue operations.\n\n### Errors when extracting from furnaces\n- Ensure that the furnace is not empty and has items available for extraction."}
