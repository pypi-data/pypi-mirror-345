{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES  \nNo new structures were created in the latest steps. The agent attempted to place entities but encountered errors due to invalid positions or undefined variables.  \n\n### ERROR TIPS  \n1. **Placing entities in invalid positions**  \n   - Ensure the target position is buildable before placing entities like wooden chests or transport belts.  \n   - Check for existing entities or terrain obstructions at the target location.  \n\n2. **Undefined variable errors**  \n   - Define variables like `chest` and `transport_belt` before using them in conditional statements.  \n   - Use correct variable names as suggested in the error messages (e.g., `chest_pos` or `coal_chest`).  \n\n3. **Repeated placement attempts**  \n   - Avoid repeatedly attempting to place entities in the same invalid positions.  \n   - Use a check to verify if the position is valid before attempting placement.  \n\n4. **Extracting and inserting items**  \n   - Ensure the target entity (e.g., chest or burner mining drill) exists and is accessible before extracting or inserting items.  \n   - Verify the inventory of the target entity to ensure it can accept or provide the required items.  \n\n5. **Handling stale entity data**  \n   - Refresh or update entity data before performing actions to avoid using outdated information.  \n   - Use up-to-date entity positions and statuses for accurate interactions."}
