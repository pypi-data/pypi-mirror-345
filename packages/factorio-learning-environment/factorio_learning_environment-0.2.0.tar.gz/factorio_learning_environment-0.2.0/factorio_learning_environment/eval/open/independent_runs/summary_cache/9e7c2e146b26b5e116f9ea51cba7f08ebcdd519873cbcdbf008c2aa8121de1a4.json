{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-20, -70)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (-20.0, -70.0) with iron ore input and iron plate output.\n- Furnace at position (-18.0, -70.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Furnace at position (-19.0, -65.0) with iron ore input.\n- Furnace at position (-21.0, -62.0) with iron ore input and iron plate output.\n- Burner inserter at position (-20.5, -66.5) connected to transport belt and furnace.\n- Burner inserter at position (-17.5, -64.5) connected to furnace and wooden chest.\n- Wooden chests at positions (-16.5, -64.5), (-20.5, -63.5) for storage.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining Facility at Position (-23, -68)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) extracting copper ore.\n- Wooden chest at position (-23.5, -69.5) storing copper ore.\n- Transport belts connecting the mining drill to the wooden chest.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Facility at Position (-14, -53)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden chest at position (-12.5, -54.5) storing iron ore.\n- Transport belts connecting the mining drill to the wooden chest.\n- Burner inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5) moving items from transport belt to wooden chest.\n\n### Miscellaneous Structures\n- Wooden chest at position (52.5, -84.5) storing coal.\n- Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with iron ore input and iron plate output.\n- Wooden chests at positions (1.5, 0.5) and (3.5, 0.5) for storage.\n- Burner inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) waiting for source items.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Furnaces Running Out of Ingredients\n- Ensure furnaces have a continuous supply of ingredients to maintain production. Check the furnace at position (-18.0, -70.0) which has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that inserters have access to source items to function properly. The burner inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) is waiting for source items.\n\n### Efficient Resource Management\n- Regularly check the inventory of chests and furnaces to ensure efficient resource management and avoid production halts."}
