{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, -60.0)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Fuel: 7 units of coal\n  - Drop position: (4.5, -58.5)\n  - Connected to a **Wooden Chest** at position (4.5, -58.5) for iron ore collection\n- **Wooden Chests** for storage:\n  - Position (4.5, -58.5) containing iron ore\n  - Positions (5.5, -60.5), (7.5, -60.5), (6.5, -60.5), (9.5, -60.5), (8.5, -60.5), and (-14.5, -50.5) are empty\n- **Stone Furnaces** for smelting iron ore:\n  - Furnace at position (-15.0, -48.0)\n    - Fuel: 10 units of coal\n    - Status: Working\n    - Contains iron ore and produces iron plates\n  - Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0)\n    - Fuel: 15 units of coal\n    - Status: Working\n    - Produces iron plates\n  - Furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0)\n    - Fuel: 26 units of coal\n    - Status: No ingredients to smelt\n    - Produces iron plates\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Full Inventory\n- Ensure that the chest at the drop position of the burner mining drill is emptied regularly to prevent mining interruptions.\n\n### Errors with No Ingredients in Furnaces\n- Regularly check and supply the necessary ingredients to the furnaces to maintain continuous production.\n\n### Errors with Fuel Management\n- Ensure that there is sufficient coal in the inventory before attempting to refuel furnaces or mining drills.\n\n### Errors with Inventory Management\n- Keep track of the inventory to avoid running out of essential resources like coal, which can halt production processes.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `insert_item`: Used to insert items into entities. Ensure items are available in the inventory before attempting to insert.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `furnace`: Represents the furnace entity, used in operations like inserting items.\n- `burner_mining_drill`: Represents the mining drill entity, used for extracting resources.\n\nBy addressing these errors and maintaining efficient resource management, the agent can improve the productivity and efficiency of its operations."}
