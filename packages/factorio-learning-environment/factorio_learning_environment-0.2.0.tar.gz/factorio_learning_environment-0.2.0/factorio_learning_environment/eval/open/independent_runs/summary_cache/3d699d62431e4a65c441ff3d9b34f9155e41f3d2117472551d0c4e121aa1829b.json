{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Offshore Pump at position(-7.5, 25.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump (position -7.5, 25.5)\n- Boiler (position -4.5, 23.0)\n- PipeGroup (fluid_system=15906, position -4.5, 19.5)\n- PipeGroup (fluid_system=15899, position -9.5, -6.5)\n\n### Steam Engine at position(-0.5, -9.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine (position -0.5, -9.5)\n- PipeGroup (fluid_system=15816, position -4.5, -7.5)\n- ElectricityGroup (id=71311, poles=[(x=2.5,y=-9.5),(x=-4.5,y=-6.5),(x=1.5,y=-7.5)])\n\n### Copper Plate Factory at position(0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace (position 0.0, 0.0)\n- Furnace (position 5.0, 5.0)\n- Lab (position 0.0, 0.0)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to power connections\n- Ensure that all power-consuming entities (like steam engines and labs) are connected to a power network. Check the status of nearby electricity groups and poles.\n\n### Errors with fluid connections\n- Verify that the offshore pump is connected to a boiler and that the boiler has fuel to operate. Ensure that the pipes are properly connected and that there is a sufficient supply of water.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
