{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) storing extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) intended to transfer iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) intended for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Misalignment\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly aligned to transfer items from the chest to the furnace. Repeated repositioning suggests misalignment issues.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Ingredients\n- Verify the inserter setup to ensure it is correctly configured to deposit iron ore into the furnace. The furnace is not receiving iron ore, indicating a setup issue.\n\n### Fuel Management\n- Regularly refuel inserters and mining drills to maintain operational status. Ensure coal is available in your inventory to refuel entities.\n\n### Inventory Management for Insertion\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities. An error occurred due to attempting to insert coal without having it in the inventory."}
