{"content": "\"\"\"\nThe latest attempt to load Copper Ore into the active furnace resulted in the following status:\n\n### Active Furnace Output Status:\n- The furnace currently shows **2 pieces of Copper Ore**, indicating that it did not process any Copper Ore despite being loaded.\n- It still retains **18 Iron Plates** and is in a **\"WORKING\"** status.\n\n### Overall Inventory Overview:\n- **Current Inventory**:\n  - 4 pieces of stone furnaces\n  - 7 pieces of coal remaining\n  - 5 pieces of iron ore\n  - **2 pieces of copper ore** remaining in my inventory (after loading).\n  - **3 pieces of iron plates**.\n\n### Observations:\n- The active furnace is operational but is not successfully processing the Copper Ore. This repeated behavior suggests there may be an issue with the smelting process or resource recognition.\n- The total Copper Ore in my inventory is now at **2 pieces**, which is insufficient for smelting into Copper Plates.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Extract Remaining Copper Ore**: I will remove the **2 pieces of Copper Ore** from the furnace again to reset its state.\n2. **Check Furnace Configuration**: Verify that the furnace is adequately configured for processing and that all necessary conditions are met for successful operation.\n3. **Reinsert and Test**: After extraction and verification, I will insert the Copper Ore again to see if the issue has been resolved.\n\nLet\u2019s start by extracting the **2 pieces of Copper Ore** from the furnace. \n\"\"\"\n\n# Extract the remaining Copper Ore from the active furnace\nextract_item(Prototype.CopperOre, active_furnace, quantity=2)  # Remove the remaining Copper Ore from the furnace \n\n# Check the inventory status of the furnace after extraction\nactive_furnace_inventory_status_after_extraction = inspect_inventory(active_furnace)  # Inspect the status of the furnace post-extraction\noverall_inventory_after_extraction = inspect_inventory()  # Check total inventory after extraction.\n\nprint(f\"Active Furnace inventory status after extraction: {active_furnace_inventory_status_after_extraction}\")  # Status of the furnace after extracting copper\nprint(f\"Overall current inventory after extraction: {overall_inventory_after_extraction}\")  # Total inventory after extraction\nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")  # Review entities available on the map.", "summary_range": "[1-308]"}
