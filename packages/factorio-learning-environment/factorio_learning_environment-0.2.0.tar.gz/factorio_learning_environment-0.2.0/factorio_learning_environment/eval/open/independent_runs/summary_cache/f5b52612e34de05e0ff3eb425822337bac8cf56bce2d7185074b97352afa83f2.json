{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Complex (around x=-8, y=-59)\nConsists of:\n- Three burner mining drills at positions (-10.0, -59.0), (-8.0, -59.0), (-6.0, -59.0)\n- Three wooden chests at positions (-9.5, -57.5), (-7.5, -57.5), (-5.5, -57.5) collecting iron ore\nCurrent status: Drills are not working due to lack of fuel, chests contain ~72 iron ore each\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line (around x=3, y=0)\nConsists of:\n- Four stone furnaces at positions (0.0, 0.0), (2.0, 0.0), (4.0, 0.0), (6.0, 0.0)\n- Four input inserters at positions (0.5, -1.5), (2.5, -1.5), (4.5, -1.5), (6.5, -1.5)\n- Four output inserters at positions (0.5, 1.5), (2.5, 1.5), (4.5, 1.5), (6.5, 1.5)\n- Four input wooden chests with coal at positions (0.5, -2.5), (2.5, -2.5), (4.5, -2.5), (6.5, -2.5)\n- Four output wooden chests at positions (0.5, 2.5), (2.5, 2.5), (4.5, 2.5), (6.5, 2.5) containing ~42 iron plates each\n\n### Copper Production Line (around x=-27, y=-59)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at position (-28.0, -61.0)\n- Stone furnace at position (-27.0, -59.0)\n- Burner inserter at position (-25.5, -58.5)\n- Wooden chest at position (-27.5, -57.5)\nCurrent status: Drill is working but output is blocked, furnace has some copper plates\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Mining Drill Output Issues\n- Ensure there is a proper receiving entity (furnace/chest) aligned with the mining drill's drop position before starting operation\n- Check that the drop position of mining drills aligns perfectly with the input position of the receiving entity\n\n### Fuel Management\n- Keep mining drills and other burner entities fueled to maintain continuous operation\n- Set up a fuel supply system to automatically feed coal to burner entities\n\n### Entity Placement and Alignment\n- Verify exact drop positions and entity alignments before placing structures\n- Use the entity's reported drop_position coordinates for precise placement of receiving entities\n\n### Production Line Design\n- Ensure complete production chains are set up before starting operation\n- Test small sections of production lines before scaling up to larger operations"}
