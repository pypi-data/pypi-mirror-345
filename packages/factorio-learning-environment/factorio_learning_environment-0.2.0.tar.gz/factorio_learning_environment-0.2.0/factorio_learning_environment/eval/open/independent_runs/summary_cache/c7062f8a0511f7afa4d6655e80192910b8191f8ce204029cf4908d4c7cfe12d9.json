{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-12.0, -48.0) with status FULL_OUTPUT\n- Stone Furnace at position (-10.0, -48.0) with status NO_INGREDIENTS\n- Inserters and belts connecting furnaces to chests and other entities, with some inserters at positions (-11.5, -49.5) and (-13.5, -48.5) waiting for space in destination due to blocked output.\n\n### Coal Refueling System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Multiple entities at positions (-15.0, -50.0), (-13.5, -48.5), (-11.5, -49.5), (-9.5, -46.5), (-11.5, -44.5), and (-9.5, -44.5) that require coal for refueling. Some attempts to refuel these entities failed due to lack of coal in inventory.\n\n### Storage and Inventory Management\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chests at positions (-6.5, -49.5) and (-6.5, -48.5) used for storing iron plates and other items. These chests are frequently accessed for extracting and inserting items.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inventory Management and Refueling\n- Ensure that there is sufficient space in your inventory before attempting to harvest resources. If the inventory is full, you will not be able to collect additional items.\n- Maintain a sufficient supply of coal in your inventory to refuel entities. Without coal, entities that require fuel will not operate.\n\n### Placement and Spacing Errors\n- Before placing an inserter or any other entity, ensure that the target position is not already occupied by another entity. Adjust the spacing or change the direction if necessary.\n- Verify that you have enough items in your inventory before attempting to place new entities. Lack of items will prevent successful placement.\n\n### Output and Blockage Issues\n- Ensure that there is a clear path for output from furnaces and other production entities. Blocked outputs will prevent the entities from functioning correctly.\n- Regularly check and clear any blockages in belts or inserters to maintain smooth operation of your production lines."}
