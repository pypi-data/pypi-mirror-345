{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll generate a report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Transport Setup at (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0) mining coal\n- Belt group with 2 transport belts:\n  - Input belt at (41.5, -80.5) facing RIGHT\n  - Output belt at (42.5, -80.5) facing RIGHT\n- Burner inserter at (43.5, -80.5) picking up from (42.5, -80.5) and dropping at (44.5, -80.5)\n\nThe structure appears to be a coal mining setup with transport system, though currently experiencing blockages in the belt system.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Conflicts\n- Before placing entities, ensure the target location is clear of other entities\n- Multiple attempts to place burner-inserter and stone-furnace failed due to existing objects in the way\n- When rebuilding structures, remove conflicting entities first\n\n### Belt System Issues\n- Mining drill is waiting for space in destination due to blocked transport belt\n- Clear blocked belts (specifically at 41.5, -80.5) to allow continued mining\n- Ensure proper spacing between belts, inserters, and furnaces\n\n### Structure Alignment Issues\n- Pay attention to correct spacing for 2x2 structures like furnaces\n- Ensure proper alignment between belts, inserters, and furnaces\n- Consider the direction and rotation of entities during placement\n\n### Code-Related Errors\n- BeltGroup object doesn't have a 'direction' attribute - use appropriate belt-specific attributes instead\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nFunctions:\n- place_entity(): Places entities on the map\n  - Success: Returns placed entity\n  - Failure: Throws exception when placement location is blocked or invalid\n\nImportant Variables:\n- None explicitly defined in the provided logs\n\nThe agent appears to be attempting to build a coal processing setup but is struggling with entity placement and spacing issues."}
