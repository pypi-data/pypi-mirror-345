An error at spacing=0 led to a fallback placement at (1.5, 18.5), then a cleanup and reattempt with increased spacing successfully placed a new connector at (0.5, 18.5).\n\u2003\u2013 A direct connection strategy was attempted using a designated target connection point at (4.5, 20.5) on the Boiler, but no valid connection was established.\n\u2003\u2013 Multi-junction approaches were executed:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 First multi-junction (retry): intermediate junctions were targeted at (-5.5, 23.0) and (0.0, 21.0), with buildable centers resulting in a Junction A placed at approximately (-3.5, 24.5) and Junction B at (1.5, 21.5).\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 A four-segment design introduced three junctions: Junction A at (-5.5, 23.5), Junction B at (-2.5, 21.5), and Junction C at (1.5, 20.5).\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 A reconfigured three-junction design placed Junction A at (-6.5, 23.5), Junction B at (-0.5, 23.5), and Junction C at (5.5, 21.5).\n\u2003\u2013 A final multi-waypoint connection attempt used waypoints at (-5.0, 23.0) and (0.0, 21.0).\n\u2022 Despite numerous connector and junction placements, the fluid connection into the Boiler remains unestablished.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 Connector Pipe Placement Challenges:\n\u2003\u2013 When placing a connector pipe adjacent to the Boiler, ensure that the target tile is unoccupied. Adjust the spacing or reference position when errors indicate that a pipe already exists.\n\u2003\n\u2022 Pipe Network Connection Failures:\n\u2003\u2013 Verify that both the source (Offshore Pump) and target (Boiler or intermediate junctions) connection points are free of obstructions and properly aligned.\n\u2003\u2013 In multi-junction and multi-waypoint setups, ensure that each intermediate pipe segment has a valid buildable area and that the connection points on both ends are compatible with fluid transfer requirements.\n\u2003\n\u2022 Junction and Waypoint Configuration Issues:\n\u2003\u2013 Confirm that the computation of the buildable area (for example, acquiring the center point) is implemented correctly without treating Position objects as callable.\n\u2003\u2013 Reassess and adjust junction target positions when persistent connection errors occur; reposition entities or clear potential blockages as needed.\n\u2003\n\u2022 Overall Pipeline Reconfiguration:\n\u2003\u2013 Iterative reattempts and fallback strategies (e.g. increasing spacing, switching connection methods) suggest the need to reevaluate the overall layout of the pipe network. Consider alternative design strategies to achieve a stable fluid connection.\n\u2003\n\u2022 (Preserved from previous insights)\n\u2003\u2013 Ensure that resources and power dependencies are met; for instance, improving lab connectivity with additional power poles and verifying resource availability before crafting composite items.\n\nNAMESPACE\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 shift_entity_local(entity: Entity, offset: Tuple[float, float]) -> Entity  \n\u2003\u2013 Shifts the given entity\u2019s position by the specified offset  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Success: Entity is repositioned correctly  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Failure: Prototype mismatches may occur if identifier strings are not standardized\n\n\u2022 nearest_buildable(position: Position) -> BoundingBox  \n\u2003\u2013 Determines the nearest buildable area surrounding a given position for entity placement  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Success: Returns a valid bounding box for placement  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Failure: Misuse of property access can trigger errors\n\n\u2022 place_entity_next_to(prototype: Prototype, reference_position: Position, direction: Direction, spacing: int) -> Optional[Entity]  \n\u2003\u2013 Attempts to place an entity of the given prototype adjacent to a reference position based on the specified direction and spacing  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Success: Returns the placed entity  \n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Failure: Returns an error if the target position is occupied or invalid\n\nImportant Variables:\n\u2022 furnace_input_chest_pos (Position) \u2013 Holds the position of the furnace input chest  \n\u2022 current_player_inventory (Inventory) \u2013 Tracks the current state of the player\u2019s inventory  \n\u2022 mining_drill_drop (Position) \u2013 Stores the mining drill\u2019s output drop position  \n\u2022 target_chest_position (Position) \u2013 Represents the position of the attempted transport belt connection target"}
