{"content": "# FACTORIO AGENT REPORT\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System (x=-5.5, y=2.0)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump (x=-9.5, y=-0.5) extracting water\n- Boiler (x=-5.5, y=2.0) converting water to steam\n- Steam engine (x=-0.5, y=5.5) generating power\n- Pipe network connecting these components\n- Burner inserter (x=-5.5, y=4.5) for loading coal into boiler\n- The boiler is currently fueled with coal and working\n\n### Coal Mining Operation #1 (x=16.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (x=16.0, y=0.0) extracting coal\n- Wooden chest (x=15.5, y=-1.5) storing coal\n- Burner inserter (x=16.5, y=-1.5) moving coal from drill to chest\n- Transport belt (x=15.5, y=-2.5)\n- Burner inserter (x=15.5, y=-3.5) taking coal from chest to belt\n\n### Coal Mining Operation #2 (x=16.0, y=4.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (x=16.0, y=4.0) extracting coal\n- Wooden chest (x=15.5, y=2.5) storing coal\n- Burner inserter (x=16.5, y=2.5) moving coal from drill to chest\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with transport belt connections\n- Transport belts cannot connect directly to chests or boilers - always use inserters as intermediaries\n- When connecting entities with transport belts, ensure both source and target can interface with belts\n- For chests: Place an inserter to take items from the chest and drop onto the belt\n- For boilers: Place an inserter to take items from the belt and insert into the boiler\n\n### Errors with entity placement\n- Check for collisions before placing entities - existing entities (like mining drills) can block placement\n- When placing entities next to others, be aware of spacing and direction parameters\n- Pipes and other infrastructure can block inserter placement - try different directions or increase spacing\n- For tight spaces, consider the size of entities (mining drills are 2x2, boilers are 2x3, etc.)\n\n### Errors with long-distance connections\n- Transport belts cannot connect entities that are far apart (like from x=15.5 to x=-5.5)\n- For long distances, build a continuous belt path between source and destination\n- Use underground belts for crossing other infrastructure or saving space\n\n### Steam engine not working\n- The steam engine is showing \"not connected to power network\" warning\n- Add electric poles to connect the steam engine to your power network"}
