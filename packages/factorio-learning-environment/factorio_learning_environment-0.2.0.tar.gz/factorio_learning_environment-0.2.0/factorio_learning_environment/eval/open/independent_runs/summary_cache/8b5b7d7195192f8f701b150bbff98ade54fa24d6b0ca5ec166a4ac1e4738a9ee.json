{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, -60.0) extracting iron ore, with a drop position at (4.5, -58.5).\n- **Iron Chest** at position (-5.5, -50.5) storing iron ore and iron plates.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (-15.0, -48.0), (-13.0, -48.0), and (-11.0, -48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Storage Area\nConsists of:\n- Multiple **Wooden Chests** at positions (5.5, -60.5), (7.5, -60.5), (6.5, -60.5), (9.5, -60.5), (8.5, -60.5), and (4.5, -58.5) for storing various resources.\n- **Iron Chests** at positions (-6.5, -50.5) and (-5.5, -50.5) for storing iron ore and iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Warnings of Full Chests\n- Ensure to regularly empty chests that are full to prevent mining and production stoppages. For example, the chest at (4.5, -58.5) is full, halting the mining process.\n\n### Furnace Warnings\n- Furnaces at positions (-15.0, -48.0), (-13.0, -48.0), and (-11.0, -48.0) have warnings of \"no ingredients to smelt\". Ensure consistent supply of iron ore to these furnaces to maintain production efficiency.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- None defined in the provided steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `iron_ore: int` - Tracks the amount of iron ore in inventory.\n- `iron_plate: int` - Tracks the amount of iron plates in inventory.\n- `coal: int` - Tracks the amount of coal in inventory.\n- `wood: int` - Tracks the amount of wood in inventory.\n- `iron_gear_wheel: int` - Tracks the amount of iron gear wheels in inventory."}
