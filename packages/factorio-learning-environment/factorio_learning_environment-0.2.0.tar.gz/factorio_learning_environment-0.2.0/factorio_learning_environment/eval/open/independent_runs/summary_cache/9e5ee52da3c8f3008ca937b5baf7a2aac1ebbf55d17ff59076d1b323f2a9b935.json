{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-0.5, 25.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (-0.5, 25.5)\n- Boiler at position (-5.5, 25.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe connections facilitating fluid flow between these entities.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (15.0, 0.0) with a fuel inventory of coal.\n- Inserters at positions (17.5, 0.5) and (16.5, 0.5) for moving items between entities.\n- Wooden Chests at positions (5.5, 0.5) and (18.5, 0.5) for storing iron ore and other materials.\n- Small Electric Pole at position (17.5, -0.5) for power distribution.\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- PipeGroup at position (-1.5, 17.5) with various pipe connections.\n- PipeGroup at position (0.5, 16.5) with various pipe connections.\n- PipeGroup at position (-6.5, 20.5) with a single pipe.\n- PipeGroup at position (-9.5, 22.5) carrying water, indicating a connection to the offshore pump.\n\n### Electricity Network\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at various positions, including (1.5, 25.5), (11.5, 6.5), and (15.5, 2.5), providing power distribution across the map.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors When Placing Pipes\n- Ensure that the target location for placing pipes is clear and not obstructed by other entities. Adjust the positioning as necessary to avoid placement errors.\n\n### Boiler and Steam Engine Not Connected\n- Verify that all necessary connections are made between the boiler, steam engine, and offshore pump. Ensure that pipes are correctly aligned and connected to facilitate fluid flow.\n\n### Inserter Not Receiving Power\n- Check that inserters are within the range of electric poles and that the poles are connected to a power source. Ensure that the electricity network is complete and functional.\n\n### Errors When Placing Underground Pipe Ends\n- Confirm that the underground pipe ends are placed within valid distances and that there are no obstructions in the intended path. Adjust the positioning or path as needed to ensure successful placement."}
