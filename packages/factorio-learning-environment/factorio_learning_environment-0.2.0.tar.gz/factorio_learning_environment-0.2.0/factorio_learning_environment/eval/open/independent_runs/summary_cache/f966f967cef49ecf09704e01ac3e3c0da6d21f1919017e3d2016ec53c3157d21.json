{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n###Iron/Copper Processing Setup at (-27, -58)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace at (-27, -58)\n- Burner inserter at (-28.5, -59.5) oriented to face the furnace\n- Input chest containing iron and copper ore\nNote: Attempted to place an output chest but failed due to space constraints\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied spaces\n- Before placing a chest or any entity, check if the target position is already occupied by another entity\n- When using place_entity_next_to function, consider:\n  - Increasing the spacing parameter (currently 0)\n  - Using a different direction\n  - Adjusting the reference position\n  - Verifying the target position is clear of other entities like inserters\n\n### Furnace operation issues\n- Ensure proper connection between input chest, inserter, and furnace for automated material flow\n- Verify inserter orientation allows proper item transfer between containers\n- Check if furnace has both fuel and processing materials available"}
