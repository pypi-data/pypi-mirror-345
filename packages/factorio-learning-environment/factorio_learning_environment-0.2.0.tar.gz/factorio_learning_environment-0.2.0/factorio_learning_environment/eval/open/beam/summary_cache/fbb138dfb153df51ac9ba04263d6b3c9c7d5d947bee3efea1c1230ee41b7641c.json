{"content": "\"\"\"\nThe attempt to extract items from the active furnace has failed, indicating that there are no items available for extraction. This suggests that the furnace is not currently holding any stone or Copper Ore, which aligns with the previous observations of it not processing materials.\n\n### Current Active Furnace Output Status:\n- The active furnace still shows **18 Iron Plates** and is in a **\"WORKING\"** state.\n- There are no stone or Copper Ore items present in the furnace, which is confirmed by the error message indicating \"No item to extract.\"\n\n### Overall Inventory Overview:\n- **Current Inventory**:\n  - 4 pieces of stone furnaces\n  - 7 pieces of coal remaining\n  - 5 pieces of iron ore\n  - **1 piece of copper ore** available.\n  - **3 pieces of iron plates** available.\n\n### Observations:\n- The furnace is not responding to any input commands, and it seems to be stuck in its current state.\n- The lack of items in the furnace suggests that the previous attempts to load materials were ineffective.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Restart the Furnace**: Since the furnace is not processing, I may need to consider dismantling the furnace and rebuilding it to reset its state entirely.\n2. **Rebuild the Furnace**: If dismantling is an option, I will remove the active furnace and place a new one, ensuring it is correctly configured.\n3. **Load Materials Again**: After setting up a new furnace, I will load the necessary materials (stone and Copper Ore) to initiate the smelting process.\n\nTo proceed, I will dismantle the existing furnace and then build a new one. \n\nLet's execute the dismantling process first.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Dismantle the existing active furnace\ndismantle(active_furnace)  # Remove the active furnace from the map\n\n# Build a new stone furnace in the same location\nnew_furnace_position = Position(x=0.0, y=0.0)  # Using the same position as the previous furnace\nbuild_furnace(Prototype.StoneFurnace, new_furnace_position)  # Build a new stone furnace at the specified position\n\n# Check the status of the newly built furnace and overall inventory\nnew_active_furnace = get_entity_at(new_furnace_position)  # Get the newly built furnace entity\nnew_active_furnace_status = inspect_inventory(new_active_furnace)  # Inspect the status of the new furnace\noverall_inventory_after_building = inspect_inventory()  # Check total inventory after building the new furnace\n\nprint(f\"New Active Furnace inventory status: {new_active_furnace_status}\")  # Status of the new furnace after building.\nprint(f\"Overall current inventory after building new furnace: {overall_inventory_after_building}\")  # Total inventory post operations.\nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")  # Review entities available on the map.", "summary_range": "[1-330]"}
