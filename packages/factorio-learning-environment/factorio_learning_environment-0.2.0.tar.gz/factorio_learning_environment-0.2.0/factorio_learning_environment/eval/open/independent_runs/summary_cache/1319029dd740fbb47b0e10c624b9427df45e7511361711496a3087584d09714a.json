Regularly check and refuel inserters to prevent interruptions in material transfer.\n\n### Errors Due to Furnaces Running Out of Ingredients\n- Regularly supply furnaces with the necessary ingredients to avoid production halts. Implement a consistent supply chain to ensure furnaces are continuously fed with raw materials."}
