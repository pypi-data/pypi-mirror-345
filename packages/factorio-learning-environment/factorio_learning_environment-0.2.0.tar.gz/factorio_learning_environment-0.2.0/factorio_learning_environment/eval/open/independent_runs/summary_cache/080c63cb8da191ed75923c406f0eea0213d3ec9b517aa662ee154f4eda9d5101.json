The chest is currently full.\n\n### Iron Ore Mine at Position(-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position(-15.0, -50.0) which mines iron-ore\n- Wooden Chest at Position(-14.5, -48.5) which stores the mined iron-ore.\n\n### Stone Furnace at Position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position(0.0, 0.0) which smelts iron-ore. The furnace source is full.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n -  Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place a entity to a tile before attempting placing\n### Errors when extracting items from a full container\n- Check if the destination container has enough space before extracting items from a source container. The wooden chest at (3.5, -71.5) is full, preventing the extraction of iron ore.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n### Variables:\n- extracted_iron_ore_furnace: Type unknown. Errors occurred when attempting to extract from furnace.\n- extracted_iron_ore_new: Type unknown. Errors occurred when attempting to extract from new_chest.\n```"}
