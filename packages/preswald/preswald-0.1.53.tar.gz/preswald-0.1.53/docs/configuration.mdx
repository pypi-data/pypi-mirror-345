When initializing a new Preswald project with `preswald init`, a default `preswald.toml` file is created. This file defines core settings for the app, including logging, theming, and data connections. Data connections can include databases like PostgreSQL or local CSV files.

## Default Configuration (`preswald.toml`)

The following is the default structure of `preswald.toml` created during initialization:

### Example `preswald.toml`

```toml
[project]
title = "Preswald Project"
version = "0.1.0"
port = 8501
slug = "preswald-project"
entrypoint = "hello.py"

[branding]
name = "Preswald Project"
logo = "images/logo.png"
favicon = "images/favicon.ico"
primaryColor = "#F89613"

[data.sample_csv]
type = "csv"
path = "data/sample.csv"

[logging]
level = "INFO"  # Options: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL
format = "%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s"
```

---

## Basic Configuration

### `[project]`

- `title`: Name of the app displayed in the interface.
- `version`: Version of the app.
- `port`: Port the app runs on (default is `8501`).

### `[branding]`

- `name`: Displayed name of the app.
- `logo`: Path to the logo file (relative to the project directory).
- `favicon`: Path to the favicon file.
- `primaryColor`: The primary UI color, specified as a CSS-compatible color (e.g., `#3498db`).

## Connecting to Data Sources

### CSV Example: `[data.sample_csv]`

You can use a local or remote CSV file as a data source by defining it in `preswald.toml`.

#### Fields:

- `type`: Use `"csv"`.
- `path`: Relative or absolute path to the CSV file, or a link to one

#### Example CSV Connections:

```toml
[data.customers_csv]
type = "csv"
path = "data/customers.csv"

[data.sample_csv]
type = "csv"
path = "https://storage.googleapis.com/test/sample_data.csv"
```

If the CSV file is located in a subdirectory, make sure the `path` is correct relative to the root directory.

### JSON Example: `[data.sample_json]`

You can use a JSON file as a data source with options to normalize nested structures.

#### Fields:

- **type:** Use `"json"`.
- **path:** Relative or absolute path to the JSON file.
- **record_path (optional):** Specifies a nested key path in the JSON to extract records. If provided, only the records under this key are loaded.
- **flatten (optional):** A Boolean flag that determines if nested JSON structures should be flattened. Defaults to `true`.

#### Example JSON Connection:

```toml
[data.sample_json]
type = "json"
path = "data/sample.json"
record_path = "results.items"  # Optional: Path to the records within the JSON
flatten = true                 # Optional: Set to false to retain nested structures
```

### PostgreSQL Example: `[data.sample_postgres]`

- `type`: Use `"postgres"`.
- `host`: Hostname or IP of the database server.
- `port`: Port number for the database (default is `5432`).
- `dbname`: Name of the database.
- `user`: Username for database access.

You should put the `password` for the postgres database in `secrets.toml` which is created via `preswald init`.

#### Example Postgres connection:

```toml
# preswald.toml
[data.earthquake_db]
type = "postgres"
host = "localhost"            # PostgreSQL host
port = 5432                   # PostgreSQL port
dbname = "earthquakes"        # Database name
user = "user"                 # Username

#secrets.toml
[data.earthquake_db]
password = ""
```

### Clickhouse Example: `[data.sample_clickhouse]`

#### Fields:

- `type`: Use `"clickhouse"`.
- `host`: Hostname or IP of the database server.
- `port`: Port number for the database (default is `5432`).
- `database`: Name of the database.
- `user`: Username for database access.

You should put the `password` for the postgres database in `secrets.toml` which is created via `preswald init`.

#### Example Clickhouse Connection:

```toml
# preswald.toml
[data.eq_clickhouse]
type = "clickhouse"
host = "localhost"
port = 8123
database = "default"
user = "default"

# secrets.toml
[data.eq_clickhouse]
password = ""
```

### Parquet Example: `[data.sample_parquet]`

Preswald supports high-performance Parquet files for fast, memory-efficient data loadingâ€”ideal for large datasets or production pipelines.

#### Fields:

- `type`: Use `"parquet"`.
- `path`: Path to a local `.parquet` file (absolute or relative).
- `columns`: (optional) List of column names to load as a subset. Useful for large files with many columns.

#### Example Parquet Connection:

```toml
[data.sales_parquet]
type = "parquet"
path = "data/sales_data.parquet"

[data.analytics_subset]
type = "parquet"
path = "data/analytics.parquet"
columns = ["region", "revenue", "score"]
```

## Logging Configuration

The `[logging]` section allows you to control the verbosity and format of logs generated by the app.

### Fields:

- `level`: Minimum severity level for log messages. Options:
  - `DEBUG`: Logs detailed debugging information.
  - `INFO`: Logs general app activity.
  - `WARNING`: Logs warnings or potential issues.
  - `ERROR`: Logs critical errors.
  - `CRITICAL`: Logs only severe issues that cause immediate failure.
- `format`: Specifies the format of the log messages. Common placeholders:
  - `%(asctime)s`: Timestamp of the log entry.
  - `%(name)s`: Name of the logger.
  - `%(levelname)s`: Severity level of the log.
  - `%(message)s`: Log message content.

### Example Logging Setup:

```toml
[logging]
level = "DEBUG"
format = "%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s"
```

This configuration generates detailed logs, including timestamps, logger names, and log messages.

## Telemetry Configuration

The `[telemetry]` section allows you to control whether usage data is collected to help improve Preswald.

### Fields:

- `enabled`: Controls whether telemetry data is collected
  - `true` (default): Enables telemetry data collection
  - `false`: Disables all telemetry data collection

The telemetry system collects basic usage data like:

- Preswald version
- Project identifier (slug)
- Types of data sources being used
- Command executions (without any sensitive data)

### Example Telemetry Configuration:

To disable telemetry data collection, add this to your `preswald.toml`:

```toml
[telemetry]
enabled = false  # Disables all telemetry data collection
```

If the `[telemetry]` section is not present in your configuration, telemetry will be enabled by default to help improve Preswald.
