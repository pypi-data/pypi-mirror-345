{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Coal Mining and Transfer System at Position (40.5, -83.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (40.5, -83.5) with 672 units of coal.\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) fueled by coal, connected to a wooden chest and a burner inserter, actively mining coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (41.5, -83.5), transferring coal between chests and the mining drill.\n- Wooden Chest at position (42.5, -83.5) with 642 units of coal.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (61.0, -54.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (61.0, -54.0) fueled by coal, currently inactive due to lack of ingredients, with a small inventory of iron plates.\n- Wooden Chests at positions (61.5, -52.5), (62.5, -53.5), and (62.5, -52.5), each containing coal.\n- Stone Furnace at position (64.0, -53.0) fueled by coal, also inactive due to lack of ingredients, with a small inventory of iron plates.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Ingredients in Furnaces\n- Ensure that the stone furnaces have a continuous supply of raw materials to maintain production. Consider setting up a logistics system to automatically feed raw materials into the furnaces.\n\n### Errors in Resource Management\n- Regularly check the inventory levels of critical resources like coal and iron plates to prevent production halts. Automate resource distribution to maintain optimal levels.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- **Utility Functions**: None defined in the logs.\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the player's current inventory of resources.\n  - `entities_on_map`: List[Entity] - Represents the entities currently placed on the map, with their positions and statuses."}
