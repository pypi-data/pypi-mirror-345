{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, -60.0) with a drop position at (4.5, -58.5). It is currently working but has a warning that the chest at the drop position is full.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (5.5, -60.5), (7.5, -60.5), (6.5, -60.5), (9.5, -60.5), (8.5, -60.5), and (4.5, -58.5). The chest at (4.5, -58.5) contains iron ore.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (-15.0, -48.0), (-13.0, -48.0), and (-11.0, -48.0). The furnace at (-15.0, -48.0) is out of fuel, the furnace at (-13.0, -48.0) is working, and the furnace at (-11.0, -48.0) has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### No Coal Available for Refueling\n- Ensure that there is sufficient coal in the inventory to refuel the burner mining drill to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Full Chest at Drop Position\n- Regularly empty the chest at the drop position (4.5, -58.5) to prevent interruptions in mining operations.\n\n### Furnace Out of Fuel\n- Monitor fuel levels in furnaces and refuel them promptly to avoid production halts.\n\n### Furnace with No Ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces have a continuous supply of ingredients to maintain productivity.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- **Utility Functions**: None defined.\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the current inventory of items such as 'wooden-chest', 'iron-plate', and 'iron-gear-wheel'."}
