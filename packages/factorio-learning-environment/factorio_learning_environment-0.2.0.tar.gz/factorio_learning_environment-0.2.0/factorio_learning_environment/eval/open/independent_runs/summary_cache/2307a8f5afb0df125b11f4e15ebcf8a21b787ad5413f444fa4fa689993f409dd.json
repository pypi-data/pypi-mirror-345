{"content": "I'll create a report based on the execution logs provided.\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n###Coal Mining and Transport System at (-82.0, -80.5)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0)\n- Wooden chest at (41.5, -80.5)\n- Burner inserter at (42.5, -80.5) moving coal from chest to belt\n- Belt system consisting of 2 transport belts at:\n  - (43.5, -80.5) facing right\n  - (44.5, -80.5) facing right\n\nThe system is operational with the drill working, chest storing coal, and inserter moving items to belt.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Collision Errors\n- When placing entities, check for and pick up any items on ground that might block placement\n- Ensure proper spacing between entities when using place_entity_next_to function\n- Consider increasing spacing parameter if initial placement fails\n\n### Belt System Blockage\n- Clear belt blockages before attempting to place new entities near belts\n- Monitor belt inventory and clear when necessary to maintain flow\n\n### Entity Alignment Issues\n- Verify entity positions and alignments before finalizing placement\n- Double check inserter pickup and drop positions align with intended targets\n- When placing furnaces, ensure they align with inserter drop positions\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nFunctions:\n- place_entity_next_to(entity_type, reference_position, spacing, direction) -> Returns placed entity or raises exception\n  Success: When placement area is clear and within valid building space\n  Failure: When collision detected or invalid placement position\n\nImportant Variables:\n- Belt positions: Vector2 (x, y)\n- Entity positions: Vector2 (x, y)\n- Inventory: Dictionary[str, int]\n- Entity status: EntityStatus enum\n- Direction: Enum (RIGHT, LEFT, UP, DOWN)"}
