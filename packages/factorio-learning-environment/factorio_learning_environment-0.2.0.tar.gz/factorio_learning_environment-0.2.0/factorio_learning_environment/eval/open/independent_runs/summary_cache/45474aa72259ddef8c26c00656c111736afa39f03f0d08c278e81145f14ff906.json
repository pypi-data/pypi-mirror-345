{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and deposits it into the chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities too far\n- Ensure you are within the maximum placement distance (10 tiles) from the target position before attempting to place an entity. Move closer to the target position to avoid placement errors.\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied spaces\n- Verify that the target tile is unoccupied and suitable for placement before attempting to place an entity. Consider adjusting the spacing, direction, or reference position to avoid collisions with existing entities.\n\n### Errors with inserter alignment and functionality\n- Double-check the alignment and setup of inserters to ensure they are correctly positioned to transfer items between entities. Ensure inserters are fueled and have a clear path for item transfer.\n\n### Errors with chest capacity\n- Regularly monitor and manage the inventory of chests to prevent them from becoming full, which can halt production processes. Consider expanding storage capacity or frequently emptying the chest to maintain workflow.\n\n### Errors with furnace operation\n- Ensure the furnace has the necessary ingredients (iron ore) and fuel to operate. Check inserter setup and chest inventory to ensure a continuous supply of materials to the furnace."}
