{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with a fuel inventory containing coal and a furnace result inventory containing iron plates.\n- Stone Furnace at position (2.0, 0.0) with a fuel inventory containing coal and a furnace result inventory containing iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (1.5, 1.5) with a fuel inventory containing coal, connected to the stone furnaces at positions (0.0, 0.0) and (2.0, 0.0).\n- Burner Inserter at position (3.5, 1.5) with a fuel inventory containing coal, connected to the stone furnace at position (2.0, 0.0).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when crafting items without required resources\n- Ensure all required raw resources are gathered before attempting to craft items. For example, wood must be gathered before crafting wooden chests.\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Verify that the target tile is unoccupied before placing an entity. Adjust the position or direction if necessary to avoid conflicts with existing objects.\n\n### Errors due to undefined variables\n- Ensure that variables are properly defined and initialized before use. For instance, ensure that `first_chest` is correctly assigned before attempting to access its properties.\n\n### Errors when inserting items without available inventory\n- Check that the inventory contains the necessary items before attempting to insert them into another entity. For example, ensure coal is available in the inventory before inserting it into an inserter.\n\n### Errors when accessing non-existent entities\n- Confirm the existence of an entity at a specified position before attempting to access it. Ensure that the entity type and position are correct to avoid retrieval errors."}
