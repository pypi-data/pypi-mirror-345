{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) fueled by coal, smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter 1** at position (x=1.5, y=0.5), transferring iron plates from the furnace to a wooden chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=2.5, y=0.5), storing iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter 2** at position (x=3.5, y=0.5), extracting iron plates from the wooden chest and placing them onto a transport belt.\n- **Transport Belt** connecting from position (x=3.5, y=0.5) to (x=6.5, y=0.5), moving iron plates along the line.\n- **Burner Inserter 3** at position (x=6.5, y=0.5), transferring iron plates from the transport belt to the end wooden chest.\n- **End Wooden Chest** at position (x=7.5, y=0.5), collecting iron plates from the transport belt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Ensure there is no existing entity at the target position before attempting to place a new entity. Consider adjusting the spacing or direction if necessary.\n\n### Errors due to lack of inventory items\n- Verify that the required items are available in the inventory before attempting to place or craft entities. Gather necessary resources like wood before crafting dependent items like wooden chests.\n\n### Errors when connecting belts directly from chests\n- Use an inserter to transfer items from a chest to a transport belt instead of attempting a direct connection. Ensure that the inserter is correctly placed and oriented.\n\n### Errors when inserting items without inventory\n- Ensure that the items you intend to insert are available in your inventory. Check inventory levels before attempting to insert items into entities."}
