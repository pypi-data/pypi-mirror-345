{"content": "# Factorio Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Factory at position(-5, -65)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-5.0, -65.0) that processes iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (47.0, -82.0) that extracts iron ore.\n- Multiple Wooden Chests at positions (46.5, -83.5), (48.5, -83.5), (5.5, -79.5), and (10.5, -79.5) for storage of resources.\n- Boiler at position (0.5, 6.0) for heating water to produce steam.\n- Steam Engine at position (0.5, 0.5) that generates electricity from steam.\n\n### Pipe Network\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Pipe Groups at various positions (e.g., (-2.5, 3.5), (0.5, 3.5), (5.5, 2.5), (1.5, 7.5), (-8.5, 24.5)) for transporting fluids between the Boiler and Steam Engine.\n\n### Transport Belt System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Belt Group at position (40.5, -84.5) that connects different entities for resource transportation.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to insufficient resources\n- Ensure you have enough pipes in your inventory before attempting to connect the Boiler and Steam Engine. Consider gathering more resources or crafting additional pipes if needed.\n\n### Errors when placing Offshore Pump\n- Cannot place Offshore Pump as it is not in inventory. Always check your inventory for required items before attempting to place structures.\n\n### Errors when connecting Boiler and Steam Engine\n- Make sure to have the necessary pipes to connect the Boiler and Steam Engine. Verify that all connections are properly established and that there are no gaps in the pipe network.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing. Check for existing structures or items that may block placement."}
