{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Smelting Array at (0,0)\nConsists of four furnaces arranged in a grid:\n- Stone furnace at (0.0, 0.0)\n- Stone furnace at (2.0, 0.0) \n- Stone furnace at (2.0, 4.0)\n- Stone furnace at (4.0, 4.0)\nAll furnaces are idle with no ingredients but fueled with coal\n\n### Automated Iron Mining & Smelting at (-18.0, -53.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-18.0, -53.0) mining iron ore\n- Stone furnace at (-17.0, -51.0) for direct smelting\nCurrently drill is working but blocked due to full output, furnace is working and contains iron plates\n\n### Automated Copper Mining & Smelting at (-21.0, -73.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-21.0, -73.0) mining copper ore\n- Stone furnace at (-20.0, -71.0) for direct smelting\nCurrently drill is working but blocked due to full output, furnace is working and contains copper plates\n\n### Research Lab Setup at (10.5, 0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Lab loaded with automation science packs\nCurrently not functioning due to lack of power\n\n### Power Generation System\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Boiler at (-14.5, 19.0) with coal fuel\n- Steam engine at (-8.5, 19.5)\n- Electric pole network connecting to lab\nSystem is not operational due to fluid connection issues\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Connection Issues\n- When connecting fluid-based entities:\n  - Ensure direct straight-line connections where possible\n  - Avoid blocked connection points\n  - Plan pipe routes to avoid entity collision\n  - Keep pipe connections as short as possible\n  - Pay attention to the specific connection points of each entity (input/output positions)\n\n### Pipe Management Issues\n- Clean up existing pipe groups before attempting new connections\n- Use minimal pipe connections to reduce complexity\n- Verify connection points are accessible before placing pipes\n- Ensure proper alignment between entity connection points\n\n### Power System Setup Issues\n- Connect components in correct order: pump \u2192 boiler \u2192 steam engine\n- Verify fluid flow at each connection point\n- Monitor entity status messages for connection problems\n- Ensure power poles create complete electrical network\n- Pay attention to the specific input/output points of the boiler (water input and steam output)\n\n### Resource Management Issues\n- Monitor furnace and drill outputs to prevent blockages\n- Extract products regularly to maintain production flow\n- Maintain adequate coal supplies for multiple fuel-consuming entities\n- Clear full outputs from mining drills and furnaces regularly\n\n### Inventory Management\n- Keep track of required items for crafting and construction\n- Ensure sufficient iron plates for crafting pipes\n- Extract processed materials from furnaces regularly\n\n### API Usage Issues\n- Use correct entity references when cleaning up or modifying structures\n- Handle entity type checking properly in code\n- Verify entity existence before attempting interactions\n- Clean up pipe systems completely before attempting new connections"}
