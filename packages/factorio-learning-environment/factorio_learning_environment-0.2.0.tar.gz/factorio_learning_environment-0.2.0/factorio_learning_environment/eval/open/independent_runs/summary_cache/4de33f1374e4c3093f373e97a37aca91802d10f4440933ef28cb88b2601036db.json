{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=-1.5, y=24.0)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=-1.5, y=24.0)\n- Steam Engine at position (x=5.5, y=21.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine with various pipes (positions include (x=-8.5, y=23.5), (x=-9.5, y=23.5), (x=-4.5, y=23.5), (x=5.5, y=18.5), etc.)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Furnaces at positions (x=0.0, y=0.0), (x=10.0, y=0.0), (x=13.0, y=0.0), and (x=16.0, y=0.0)\n- Chests at positions (x=8.5, y=-0.5), (x=17.5, y=-0.5), (x=19.5, y=-0.5), and (x=20.5, y=-0.5)\n- Burner Inserters at positions (x=8.5, y=0.5), (x=17.5, y=0.5), (x=19.5, y=0.5), and (x=20.5, y=0.5) for transferring items between chests and furnaces\n\n### Research Lab Facility\nConsists of:\n- Lab at position (x=2.5, y=0.5)\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at positions (x=1.5, y=2.5), (x=3.5, y=20.5), (x=1.5, y=14.5), (x=1.5, y=6.5), and (x=1.5, y=10.5) providing power to the lab\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Pipe Connections\n- Ensure that pipes and underground pipes are correctly aligned and connected between the offshore pump and the boiler. Double-check the positions and ensure no obstructions are present.\n\n### Errors with Inserters\n- Verify that inserters have access to source items and that destination chests or belts have space to receive items. Check the source and destination inventories to resolve waiting issues.\n\n### Errors with Power Connections\n- Ensure that all power poles are properly connected to provide electricity to the lab and other facilities. Check for any missing connections or misaligned poles.\n\n### Errors with Fuel Supply\n- Maintain an adequate supply of coal in your inventory to refuel boilers and inserters. Regularly check and restock fuel supplies to prevent interruptions.\n\n### Errors with Inventory Management\n- Before attempting to insert items into furnaces or other entities, ensure that the required items are available in your inventory to avoid insertion errors."}
