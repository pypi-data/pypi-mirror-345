{"content": "\"\"\"\nThe extraction process has yielded unexpected results:\n\n### New Active Furnace Status:\n- The active furnace now contains **1 piece of stone-brick** instead of being empty. This indicates that the furnace converted the stone into stone-brick during the previous operations.\n- The furnace's status remains **\"NO INGREDIENTS\"**, indicating it is not currently processing any materials.\n\n### Overall Inventory Overview:\n- **Current Inventory**:\n  - 5 pieces of stone furnaces (including the new one)\n  - **13 pieces of coal** available.\n  - **1 piece of stone** remains in my inventory.\n  - **5 pieces of iron ore** available.\n  - **1 piece of copper ore** available.\n  - **21 pieces of iron plates** available.\n\n### Observations:\n- The furnace has processed the stone into stone-brick, which is why it is not empty.\n- I still need to gather additional stone to meet the requirement for loading **5 pieces of stone** into the furnace along with **1 piece of Copper Ore**.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Harvest Additional Stone**: I will need to locate and harvest **4 more pieces of stone** to have a total of **5 pieces**.\n2. **Reload the Furnace**: After I collect enough stone, I will then insert it together with the **1 piece of Copper Ore** back into the furnace.\n3. **Check Processing Activation**: I will monitor to see if the furnace begins processing once all materials are loaded.\n\nLet's proceed to find and gather the required additional stone resources. \n\"\"\"\n\n# Find the nearest stone resource patch for gathering additional stone\nstone_resource_position = nearest(Resource.Stone)\n\n# Move to collect more stone resources\nmove_to(stone_resource_position)  # Navigate to the nearest Stone resource location \n\n# Harvest the 4 additional pieces of stone needed\nharvest_resource(nearest(Resource.Stone), quantity=4)  # Attempting to gather 4 more pieces of stone \n\n# Check the overall inventory again after harvesting to confirm collected stone\noverall_inventory_after_harvesting_additional_stone = inspect_inventory()  # Check overall inventory after harvest.\nprint(f\"Overall current inventory after harvesting additional stone: {overall_inventory_after_harvesting_additional_stone}\")  # Confirm total inventory after harvesting stone.\nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")  # Review entities available on the map.", "summary_range": "[1-436]"}
