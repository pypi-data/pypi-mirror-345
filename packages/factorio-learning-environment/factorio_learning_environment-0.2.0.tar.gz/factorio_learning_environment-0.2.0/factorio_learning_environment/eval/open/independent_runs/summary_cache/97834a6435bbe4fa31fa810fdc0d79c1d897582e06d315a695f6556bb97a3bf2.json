{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at Position (-23.0, -68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-24.5, -67.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -54.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with a Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5) and a Burner Inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) transferring items between chests\n- Wooden Chest at position (3.5, 0.5) for output storage\n\n### Copper Furnace at Position (-21.0, -62.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-21.0, -62.0) with no connected input or output entities\n\n### Transport Belt Network\nConsists of the following BeltGroups:\n- BeltGroup connecting positions from (-21.5, -63.5) to (-21.5, -65.5)\n- BeltGroup connecting positions from (-16.5, -64.5) to (-12.5, -58.5)\n- BeltGroup connecting positions from (-17.5, -62.5) to (-17.5, -64.5)\n- BeltGroup connecting positions from (-14.5, -62.5) to (-14.5, -65.5)\n- BeltGroup connecting positions from (-14.5, -54.5) to (-17.5, -59.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting entities\n- Ensure that all entities being connected are valid and initialized properly. Avoid attempting to connect entities that might be `None` or uninitialized.\n\n### Errors due to blocked output\n- Ensure that the output of mining drills or other entities is not blocked by items on the ground. Always have a sink entity, like a chest or belt, ready to accept the output.\n\n### Errors due to missing ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces and assemblers have the necessary ingredients to process. Regularly check the input inventory and supply chains to avoid production halts.\n\n### Errors with inserters waiting for source items\n- Verify that inserters have access to source items. Ensure that the supply chain is intact and that items are being transported to the inserter's pickup position."}
