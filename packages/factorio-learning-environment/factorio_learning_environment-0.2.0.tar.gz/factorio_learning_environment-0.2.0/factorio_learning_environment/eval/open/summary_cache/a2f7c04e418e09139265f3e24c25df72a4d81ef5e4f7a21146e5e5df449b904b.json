{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron plate production setup at position around (16.0, 71.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (16.0, 71.0) facing down, extracting iron ore.\n- Stone furnace at position (16.0, 73.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden chest at position (17.5, 73.5) to collect iron plates from the furnace.\n- Burner inserter at position (16.5, 74.5) moving iron ore from the burner mining drill to the furnace.\n- Burner inserter at position (18.5, 73.5) moving iron plates from the furnace to the wooden chest.\n\n### Iron plate storage expansion at position (19.5, 73.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steel chest at position (19.5, 73.5) placed to expand iron plate storage capacity.\n- Burner inserter at position (18.5, 73.5) also interacts with this steel chest as a drop position.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors placing inserters adjacent to occupied tiles\n- When placing an inserter next to another entity (e.g., wooden chest), ensure the target tile is free. If occupied, increase spacing, change direction, or adjust reference position to avoid placement conflicts.\n\n### Errors connecting transport belts directly from chests\n- Transport belts cannot be connected directly from a chest. Always place an inserter to move items from the chest onto the belt. Use the inserter as the source entity for belt connections.\n\n### Fuel management for burner entities\n- Burner mining drills, furnaces, and inserters require fuel to operate. Consistently insert coal or other fuel to avoid stoppages. Monitor entity statuses for warnings like \"out of fuel\" and insert fuel proactively.\n\n### Inserter status issues\n- Inserters may show \"waiting for source items\" if the source inventory is empty or \"waiting for space in destination\" if the target inventory is full. Ensure balanced input/output flows and sufficient storage capacity to maintain continuous operation.\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nNo user-defined functions have been defined by the agent so far."}
