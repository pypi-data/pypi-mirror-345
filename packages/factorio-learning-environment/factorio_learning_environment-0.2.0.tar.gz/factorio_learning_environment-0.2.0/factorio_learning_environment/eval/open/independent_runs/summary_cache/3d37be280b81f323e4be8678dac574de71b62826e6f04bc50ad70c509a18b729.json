{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (1.0, 1.0) and (3.0, 1.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (1.0, 1.0) and (3.0, 1.0)\n- Burner Inserters at positions (1.5, -0.5), (3.5, -0.5), (-0.5, 1.5), (1.5, 2.5), and (3.5, 2.5) for supplying fuel and moving materials\n- BeltGroup connecting various positions for material transport\n\n### Transport Belt System\nConsists of BeltGroups:\n- BeltGroup with inputs from (x=-12.5, y=-50.5) to (x=-12.5, y=-52.5) and (x=-11.5, y=-49.5) to (x=-11.5, y=-51.5), outputs from (x=-11.5, y=-52.5) to (x=-13.5, y=-52.5)\n- BeltGroup with inputs from (x=-11.5, y=-50.5) to (x=-13.5, y=-50.5), outputs from (x=-13.5, y=-50.5) to (x=-13.5, y=-52.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items without sufficient inventory\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity.\n\n### Errors with non-functional furnaces\n- Verify that the furnaces have both fuel and the necessary ingredients to smelt. Ensure that inserters are correctly supplying both fuel and raw materials to the furnaces.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
