{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll generate a comprehensive report:\n\n# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Setup\n- Burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0) mining coal\n- Multiple storage chests:\n  - Wooden chest at (41.5, -80.5) storing coal (800 units)\n  - Iron chest at (41.5, -83.5) storing coal (1600 units)\n  - Iron chest at (41.5, -84.5) storing coal (1600 units)\n\n### Iron Smelting Setup\n- Two stone furnaces:\n  - First furnace at (45.0, -81.0)\n  - Second furnace at (47.0, -81.0)\n- Iron plate storage chest at (49.5, -80.5) containing 1500 iron plates\n\n### Transport System\n- Coal transport belt system:\n  - Belt at (43.5, -80.5) oriented downward\n  - Belt at (43.5, -82.5) oriented rightward\n- Inserters:\n  - Burner inserter at (42.5, -80.5) moving coal from chest to belt\n  - Burner inserter at (44.5, -82.5) for furnace input\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Collisions\n- Before placing transport belts or other entities, check if the target location is already occupied\n- Multiple attempts to place transport-belt at (44.5, -80.5) failed due to existing objects\n\n### Transport System Bottlenecks\n- Transport belts are getting blocked, causing upstream inserters to wait\n- Ensure proper spacing and flow management in belt systems\n- Consider the entire logistics chain when designing transport systems\n\n### Resource Management\n- Chests are reaching maximum capacity (multiple \"chest is full\" warnings)\n- Implement better resource distribution to prevent storage bottlenecks\n- Consider adding overflow protection or balanced distribution systems\n\n# NAMESPACE\n\n### Variables\n- No significant variable assignments visible in the logs\n\n### Functions\n- `place_entity()`: Used for placing game entities\n  - Success: Successfully places entities when space is available\n  - Failure: Fails when target location is occupied by other entities\n\n### Entity States\n- Mining drill status transitions between WORKING and WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION\n- Inserters frequently in WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION or WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS states\n- Furnaces in NO_INGREDIENTS state with full fuel storage"}
