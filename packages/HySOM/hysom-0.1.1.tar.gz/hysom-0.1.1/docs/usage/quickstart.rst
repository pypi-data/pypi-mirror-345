Quickstart
===========

This section provides tutorials to help you get started with the HySOM package. Designed for easy learning, they offer step-by-step guidance on using the package.  
Below is a minimal example demonstrating how to train a Self-Organizing Map (SOM) with default hyperparameters on a sample dataset and visualize the results.


✨ Quick Example

.. code-block:: python

   from hysom import SOM
   from hysom.datasets import load_sample_data
   import numpy as np

   # Generate synthetic data
   data = load_sample_data()  

   # Train SOM
   som = SOM(width=8, height=8, input_dim = data.shape[1:])
   som.train(data, epochs = 5)

   # Visualize results
   plot_som_map(som)

For a detailed explanation of the SOM class, including diagnosing the training process using topographic and quantization errors refer to the following tutorial.
