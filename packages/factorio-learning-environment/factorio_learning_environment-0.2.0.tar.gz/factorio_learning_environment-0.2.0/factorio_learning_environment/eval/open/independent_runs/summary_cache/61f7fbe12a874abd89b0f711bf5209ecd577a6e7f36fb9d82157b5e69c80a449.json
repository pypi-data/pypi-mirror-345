{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position(-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position -15.0, -50.0) with fuel inventory containing 2 coal. It is currently working and extracting iron ore from the wooden chest at position (-14.5, -48.5). \n- Wooden chest (position -14.5, -48.5) containing 118 iron ore. This chest is currently full, which is affecting the mining operation.\n  \n### Stone Furnace at position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position 0.0, 0.0) with fuel inventory containing 1 coal. It is currently working and producing iron plates, with 77 iron plates in its output inventory.\n- The furnace is connected to the wooden chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) through the mining drill.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n- **Errors related to full chest**: The burner mining drill is unable to continue mining because the chest at (-14.5, -48.5) is full. \n  - **Tip**: Regularly check and empty the wooden chest to ensure continuous operation of the mining drill.\n\n- **Repeated actions without updates**: The agent has repeatedly refueled the burner mining drill and extracted iron ore from the wooden chest without making significant progress.\n  - **Tip**: Focus on optimizing the workflow by ensuring that the output inventories are not full before performing repetitive actions.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions**: \n  - No new utility functions defined in this execution log.\n\n- **Important Variables Assigned**:\n  - `burner_mining_drill`: Entity of type `BurnerMiningDrill`\n  - `wooden_chest`: Entity of type `Chest`\n  - `stone_furnace`: Entity of type `Furnace`\n  - `inventory`: Dictionary of type `Inventory` containing items such as `iron-ore` and `coal`."}
