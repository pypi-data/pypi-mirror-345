{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (61.0, -54.0) with iron ore and coal as inputs, producing iron plates.\n- Furnace at position (64.0, -53.0) with iron ore and coal as inputs, producing iron plates.\n\n### Coal Distribution Network\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest at position (40.5, -83.5) storing coal.\n- Wooden chest at position (42.5, -83.5) storing coal.\n- Wooden chest at position (43.5, -83.5) storing coal.\n- Wooden chest at position (44.5, -83.5) storing coal.\n- Burner mining drill at position (41.0, -82.0), extracting coal and transferring it to nearby chests.\n- Burner inserter at position (41.5, -83.5), moving coal between chests.\n\n### Miscellaneous Storage\n- Wooden chest at position (61.5, -52.5) containing stone bricks, wood, coal, and stone.\n- Wooden chest at position (62.5, -53.5) containing coal.\n- Wooden chest at position (62.5, -52.5) containing coal.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Insufficient Resource Management\n- Ensure that there is a sufficient supply of iron ore to keep the furnaces operational. Regularly check inventory levels and mine additional resources as needed.\n\n### Efficient Inventory Transfers\n- Optimize the transfer of coal between chests to maintain a balanced distribution and prevent bottlenecks.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided steps.\n- Important variables:\n  - `coal_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the amount of coal in various chests.\n  - `iron_plate_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the amount of iron plates in furnaces."}
