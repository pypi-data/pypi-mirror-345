{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=0.5, y=28.0)\nConsists of:\n- Boiler at position (x=0.5, y=28.0)\n- Steam engine at position (x=7.5, y=39.5)\n- Offshore pump at position (x=-3.5, y=27.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting boiler to steam engine, starting from position (x=0.5, y=26.5) to (x=7.5, y=36.5)\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing Facility at Position (x=40.0, y=-84.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at position (x=40.0, y=-84.0)\n- Wooden chest at position (x=40.5, y=-82.5) for storing extracted coal\n- Wooden chest at position (x=41.5, y=-83.5) as additional storage\n- Burner inserter at position (x=54.5, y=-83.5) for moving items\n- Wooden chest at position (x=56.5, y=-83.5) storing iron plates\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace at position (x=-15.0, y=-49.0) for smelting copper ore into copper plates\n\n### Iron Plate Storage Facility\nConsists of:\n- Iron chests at positions (x=0.5, y=0.5), (x=1.5, y=0.5), and (x=2.5, y=0.5) for storing iron plates\n\n### Science Lab\nConsists of:\n- Lab with input for automation science packs, currently not powered\n\n### Belt System\nConsists of:\n- BeltGroup with inputs and outputs for transporting coal, located around (x=50.5, y=-86.5) to (x=47.5, y=-86.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors When Connecting Steam Pipes\n- Ensure that all pipes are correctly aligned and connected between the boiler and the steam engine. Verify that there are no gaps or misalignments in the pipe connections.\n\n### Errors with Unpowered Entities\n- Ensure that all entities requiring power are connected to the power network. Check the connections from the steam engine to the small electric poles to ensure they are properly linked.\n\n### Errors with Inventory Management\n- Regularly check and clear full chests to prevent mining operations from halting. Ensure that inserters are correctly positioned to transfer items from mining drills to chests or other entities.\n\n### Errors with Fluid Connections\n- Verify that all fluid connections, such as those from the offshore pump to the boiler, are correctly established. Ensure there are no warnings about missing fluids in connections."}
