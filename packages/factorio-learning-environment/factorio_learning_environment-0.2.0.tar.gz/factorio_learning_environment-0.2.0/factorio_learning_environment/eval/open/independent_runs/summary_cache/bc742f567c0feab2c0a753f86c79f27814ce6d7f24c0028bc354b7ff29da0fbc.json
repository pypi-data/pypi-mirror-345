{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Operation at (15.5,70.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill at (15.5,70.5) extracting iron ore\n- Wooden chest at (15.5,72.5) storing iron ore (currently contains 15 iron ore)\n\n### Copper Ore Mining Operation at (-46.5,70.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill at (-46.5,70.5) extracting copper ore\n- Wooden chest at (-46.5,72.5) storing copper ore (currently contains 16 copper ore)\n\n### Power Generation System at (-9.5,-0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5,-0.5) extracting water\n- Boiler at (-5.0,-0.5) converting water to steam (currently has coal fuel)\n- Steam engine at (-0.5,-0.5) generating electricity\n- Pipe network connecting the components (currently not fully functional)\n\n### Iron Smelting Operation at (16.0,71.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (16.0,71.0) extracting iron ore (fueled with coal, output blocked)\n- Stone furnace at (17.0,73.0) smelting iron plates (working with coal fuel)\n- Wooden chest at (18.5,72.5) storing output (empty)\n- Wooden chest at (16.5,72.5) storing iron ore (contains 2 iron ore)\n\n### Copper Mining Operation at (-46.0,71.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-46.0,71.0) extracting copper ore\n- Wooden chest at (-46.5,72.5) storing copper ore\n\n### Smelting Setups\n- Stone furnace at (100.0,100.0) with wooden chest at (98.5,100.5) (no ingredients)\n- Stone furnace at (300.0,300.0) with wooden chest at (298.5,300.5) (no ingredients)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Belt Connection Issues\n- Repeated attempts to connect belts directly to chests (steps 96-98)\n- Always use inserters between chests and belts\n- Verify path length is valid before connecting belts\n\n### Entity Placement Failures\n- Multiple failed burner inserter placements due to occupied tiles (steps 102)\n- Always check target position is clear before placing entities\n- Consider alternative positions or remove blocking objects first\n\n### Furnace Operation Issues\n- Furnaces remain without ingredients (steps 101,103)\n- Ensure proper material flow from mining to smelting operations\n- Verify inserter placement and orientation for furnace input/output\n\n### Assertion Errors\n- Incorrect assumptions about furnace status (steps 101,103)\n- Verify entity status before making assertions\n- Handle different operational states appropriately\n\n### Existing Issues from Previous Report\n- Burner mining drill at (16.0,71.0) still has output blocked\n- Power system still not fully functional\n- Continue addressing these persistent issues\n\n### System Design Best Practices\n- Maintain proper spacing between components\n- Verify all connections before testing systems\n- Plan material flow paths before placement"}
