{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-11.5, 18.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position -11.5, 18.5), boiler (position -21.5, 28.0), and offshore pump (position -9.5, 24.5). The steam engine is currently not connected and has warnings indicating no input liquid and no fluid present in connections.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 0.0, 0.0) and a furnace (position 0.0, 0.0)\n- Burner mining drill (position 5.0, 5.0) and a furnace (position 5.0, 5.0)\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine (position z1) and inserter (position a) that puts into the assembling machine\n- Beltgroup (position) that connects the furnace at position y1 to the assembling machine at position z1\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place.\n\n### Errors when placing pipes too far away\n- Move closer to the target position before attempting to place pipes. The maximum distance for placing entities is 10 units.\n\n### Errors when placing pipes overlapping water\n- Ensure that the target position for placing pipes is not overlapping with water. Look for alternative locations that are clear of water.\n\n### Errors when placing pipes at occupied positions\n- Remove any existing entities at the target position before attempting to place a new entity."}
