{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-11.5, 18.5)\nConsists of boiler (position -11.5, 25.0) and steam engine (position -11.5, 18.5) connected via pipes (positions -11.5, 23.5 and -11.5, 25.0). The offshore pump (position -9.5, 24.5) is intended to connect to the boiler.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(x)\nConsists of following entities\n-  Burner mining drill (position x1) and a furnace at position(y1)\n-  Burner mining drill (position x2) and a furnace at position(y2)\n-  Burner mining drill (position x3) and a furnace at position(y3)\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of following entities\n-  Burner mining drill (position x1) and a furnace at position(y1)\n-  Assembling machine at position(z1) and inserter at position(a) that puts into assembling machine\n-  Beltgroup (position) that connects the furnace at position y1 to assembling machine at position(z1)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when reconnecting pipes\n- Ensure that the positions of the pipes are correct and that there are no obstructions preventing the connection. Verify the coordinates before attempting to connect.\n\n### Errors when connecting offshore pump to boiler\n- Confirm that the offshore pump and boiler are within the correct range for connection. Check for any existing pipes that may be interfering with the connection.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place. Check for existing entities in the target position.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items."}
