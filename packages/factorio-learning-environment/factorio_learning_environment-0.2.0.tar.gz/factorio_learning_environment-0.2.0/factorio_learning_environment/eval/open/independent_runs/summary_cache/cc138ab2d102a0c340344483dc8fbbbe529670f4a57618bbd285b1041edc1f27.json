{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=22.5, y=-7.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=22.5, y=-7.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=20.5, y=-4.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=4.5, y=-10.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine\n\n### Copper Cable Factory at Position (x=10.5, y=0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling Machine at position (x=10.5, y=0.5) with copper cable recipe\n- Inserter at position (x=9.5, y=5.5) feeding copper plates into the assembling machine\n- Belt group connecting the copper plate source to the assembling machine\n\n### Iron Plate Production at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates\n\n### Copper Plate Production at Position (x=2.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=2.0, y=0.0) for smelting copper ore into copper plates\n\n### Iron Ore Mining at Position (x=-11.0, y=20.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-11.0, y=20.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-11.5, y=18.5) for storing mined iron ore\n\n### Copper Ore Mining at Position (x=20.0, y=20.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=20.0, y=20.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=19.5, y=18.5) for storing mined copper ore\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the inserter has access to source items before attempting to operate. Check the supply chain to ensure items are available for the inserter to pick up.\n\n### Furnace Fuel Source is Full\n- Monitor the fuel levels in furnaces to prevent overfilling. Ensure that fuel is being consumed efficiently and adjust the supply if necessary.\n\n### No Ingredients to Smelt in Furnace\n- Verify that the furnace has the necessary ingredients to operate. Ensure that the supply of raw materials is consistent and that the input is not blocked or empty.\n\n### Belt is Empty\n- Investigate upstream processes and ensure that items are being delivered to the belt. Check for blockages or disconnections in the supply chain."}
