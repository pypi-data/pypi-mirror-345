{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-12.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-12.0, -48.0) fueled with coal, producing iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-14.5, -47.5), transferring items from a chest to the furnace.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -46.5) storing iron ore.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-10.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-10.0, -48.0) fueled with coal, producing iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-8.5, -47.5), transferring items from a chest to the furnace.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-7.5, -47.5) storing iron ore.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden Chests at positions (-15.5, -48.5) and (-14.5, -48.5) storing extracted iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -48.5), transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Inventory Items\n- Ensure you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into a structure. For example, ensure coal is available before trying to insert it into a furnace.\n\n### Errors Due to Full Inventory in Structures\n- Before inserting items into a structure like a furnace, check if there is enough space in the structure's inventory to accommodate the items. This will prevent failed insertions due to full inventories.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Make sure that the source entity (e.g., chest or mining drill) has items available for the inserter to transfer. If the inserter is waiting for source items, it indicates that the source might be empty or not producing items fast enough."}
