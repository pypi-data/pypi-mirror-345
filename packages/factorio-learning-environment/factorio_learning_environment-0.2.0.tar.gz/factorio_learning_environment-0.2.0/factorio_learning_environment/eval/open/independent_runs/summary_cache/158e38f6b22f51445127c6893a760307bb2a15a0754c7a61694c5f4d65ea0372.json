{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Furnace at position(0, 0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace (position (0, 0)) with an inventory containing 100 copper plates and 3 coal as fuel. The furnace is currently not smelting due to lack of ingredients and has a full result inventory.\n\n### Chest at position(2.5, 0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Wooden chest (position (2.5, 0.5)) with an inventory containing 116 copper plates.\n\n### Copper Plate Production Line\nConsists of:\n- Furnace (position (0, 0)) connected to the wooden chest (position (2.5, 0.5)) for transferring copper plates.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n- Errors when crafting automation-science-pack:\n  - Ensure you have the required ingredients available in the correct crafting machines. The automation-science-pack requires copper plates, which must be produced in a furnace or crafted in a machine.\n  \n- Errors when transferring items to the chest:\n  - Check the inventory of the chest before transferring items to ensure there is space available. The message indicates that no copper plates were available to transfer, which may suggest the chest is full or the inventory is not being properly managed.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- Functions defined:\n  - `craft_item(Prototype.AutomationSciencePack)`: This function has failed multiple times due to insufficient ingredients.\n  \n- Important variables assigned:\n  - `copper_plate`: int\n  - `stone_furnace`: int\n  - `wood`: int\n  - `iron_plate`: int\n  - `automation_science_pack`: int\n  - `chest_inventory`: dict\n  - `furnace_inventory`: dict"}
