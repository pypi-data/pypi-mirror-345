{"content": "# Factorio Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage at Position (x=41.0, y=-82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0) connected to a transport belt and a wooden chest.\n- Transport Belt at position (x=39.5, y=-83.5) leading to a Wooden Chest at position (x=40.5, y=-83.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) for smelting iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=1.5, y=0.5) transferring items from the furnace to a Wooden Chest at position (x=2.5, y=0.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=2.5, y=0.5) storing iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=3.5, y=0.5) transferring items from the chest to a transport belt.\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (x=3.5, y=0.5) to (x=5.5, y=0.5), facilitating the movement of iron plates.\n\n### Copper Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=10.0, y=0.0) for smelting copper ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=11.5, y=0.5) transferring items from the furnace to a Wooden Chest at position (x=12.5, y=0.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=12.5, y=0.5) storing copper plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=8.5, y=0.5) transferring items from a chest to the furnace, with warnings indicating the chest is full.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Extracting Items from Incorrect Entities\n- Ensure that the entity you are trying to extract from contains the correct items. For example, attempting to extract coal from a wooden chest that does not contain coal will result in an error.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Check that the source entity has items available for the inserter to pick up. If an inserter is waiting for source items, ensure that the connected entity is producing or has items.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Space in Destination\n- Ensure that the destination entity has space to accept items from the inserter. If an inserter is waiting for space, consider clearing or expanding the storage capacity of the destination entity.\n\n### Errors with Blockages in Transport Belts\n- Regularly check and clear blockages in transport belts to ensure smooth item flow. Blockages can cause production delays and inefficiencies.\n\n### Errors with Furnaces Lacking Ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces are supplied with the necessary ingredients to continue production. If a furnace has no ingredients to smelt, provide the required resources to resume operations."}
