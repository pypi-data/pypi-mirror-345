This includes checking for existing structures or items on the ground that may block placement.\n\n### Errors when moving entities to invalid locations\n- Verify that the target location for moving an entity is valid and unoccupied. Ensure that the entity can be moved to the desired position without conflicts.\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities from invalid positions\n- Confirm the existence of an entity at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it. Use accurate coordinates and ensure the entity type matches the expected prototype.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient inventory resources\n- Before attempting to insert items into entities, ensure that the required resources are available in your inventory. Check inventory levels to avoid attempting to insert items that are not present.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items."}
