{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-47.5, -123.5)\n- Boiler at position (-46.5, -121.0)\n- Pipe Group connecting the offshore pump to the boiler at position (-47.5, -122.5)\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -73.0) with copper plates in the output inventory\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (9.0, -64.0) with iron plates in the output inventory\n\n### Inserter and Storage System\nConsists of:\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) connected to a small electric pole and a stone furnace\n- Wooden Chest at position (7.5, -61.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (6.5, -59.5) containing iron plates\n\n### Laboratory\nConsists of:\n- Lab with automation science packs but not receiving power\n\n### Pipe Networks\nVarious pipe groups are present at different positions, but they are currently empty and not connected to any active fluid systems.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Connecting Boiler to Steam Engine\n- Ensure all pipes are correctly connected between the boiler and the steam engine. Verify the path and continuity of the pipe network to ensure no gaps or misalignments.\n\n### Steam Engine Not Generating Power\n- Confirm that the steam engine is correctly connected to the power network and receiving the necessary input liquid from the boiler. Check for any warnings or errors related to fluid connections.\n\n### Inserter Not Receiving Electricity\n- Verify that the inserter is within the range of a powered electric pole. Ensure that the electric network is complete and supplying power to all connected devices.\n\n### Boiler Warnings: No Input Liquid\n- Make sure the boiler is receiving water from the offshore pump. Check the pipe connections for any breaks or incorrect placements.\n\nBy addressing these errors and ensuring proper connections, the efficiency and functionality of the structures can be significantly improved."}
