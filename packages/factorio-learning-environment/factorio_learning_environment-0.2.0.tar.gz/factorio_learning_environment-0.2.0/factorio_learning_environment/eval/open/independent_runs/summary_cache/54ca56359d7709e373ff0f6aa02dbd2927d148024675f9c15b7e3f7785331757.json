{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Setup at Position (x=2.0, y=-63.0)\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at Position (x=2.0, y=-63.0): Extracts iron ore.\n- **Stone Furnace** at Position (x=4.0, y=-63.0): Smelts iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at Position (x=3.5, y=-61.5): Transfers iron ore from the mining drill to the furnace.\n- **Wooden Chest** at Position (x=4.5, y=-61.5): Stores smelted iron plates.\n\n#### Copper Ore Mining and Smelting Setup at Position (x=-28.0, y=-61.0)\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at Position (x=-28.0, y=-61.0): Extracts copper ore.\n- **Stone Furnace** at Position (x=-26.0, y=-61.0): Smelts copper ore into copper plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at Position (x=-27.5, y=-62.5): Transfers copper ore from the mining drill to the furnace.\n- **Wooden Chest** at Position (x=-27.5, y=-59.5): Stores smelted copper plates.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when extracting items from a chest\n- Ensure the chest contains the item you are trying to extract before attempting to extract it.\n- Verify that the chest is accessible and not blocked by other entities.\n\n#### Errors when inserting items into a furnace\n- Ensure you have the required item (e.g., coal) in your inventory before attempting to insert it into the furnace.\n- Check that the furnace is not already full of the item you are trying to insert.\n\n#### Errors when harvesting resources with a full inventory\n- Clear space in your inventory before attempting to harvest resources.\n- Consider using chests or other storage solutions to manage inventory space.\n\n#### Errors with mining drills running out of fuel\n- Ensure mining drills are fueled with coal or another valid fuel source to keep them operational.\n- Regularly check the fuel levels of mining drills to prevent interruptions in resource extraction.\n\n#### Errors with furnaces having no ingredients to smelt\n- Ensure that furnaces are supplied with the necessary raw materials (e.g., iron ore, copper ore) for smelting.\n- Check the status of inserters and belts to ensure they are correctly transferring materials to the furnaces.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n#### Utility Functions\n- **extract_item(Prototype.CopperOre, chest, quantity=100)**: Attempts to extract copper ore from a chest. Fails if the chest does not contain the item or is inaccessible.\n- **insert_item(Prototype.Coal, furnace, quantity=10)**: Attempts to insert coal into a furnace. Fails if the furnace is full or if the agent's inventory lacks coal.\n- **harvest_resource(coal_pos, quantity=50)**: Attempts to harvest coal. Fails if the agent's inventory is full.\n\n#### Important Variables\n- **extracted_copper_ore**: Variable intended to store extracted copper ore. Type: `int`.\n- **furnace**: Variable representing a furnace entity. Type: `Entity`.\n- **harvested_coal**: Variable intended to store harvested coal. Type: `int`."}
