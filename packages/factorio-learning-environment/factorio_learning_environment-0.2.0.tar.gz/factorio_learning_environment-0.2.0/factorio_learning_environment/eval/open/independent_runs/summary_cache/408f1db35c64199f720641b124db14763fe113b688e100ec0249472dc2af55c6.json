{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nCurrently, there are no structures on the map. The logs indicate that the agent attempted to place various entities such as wooden chests, stone furnaces, ore inserters, plate inserters, and output chests at different coordinates, but all attempts failed. Therefore, no structures have been successfully created.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure the target tile is unoccupied before attempting to place an entity. The agent encountered multiple errors when trying to place entities such as wooden chests, stone furnaces, ore inserters, plate inserters, and output chests at various coordinates.\n\n### Errors when moving to a position\n- When using the `move_to` function, ensure that the position is correctly specified with integer indices. The agent encountered errors indicating that string indices must be integers, not 'str'.\n\n### Errors related to 'Position' object\n- Verify that the 'Position' object is being used correctly. The agent encountered errors indicating that the 'Position' object is not callable. This suggests a misuse of the 'Position' object in the code.\n\nBy addressing these errors, the agent can improve its ability to place entities and navigate the map effectively."}
