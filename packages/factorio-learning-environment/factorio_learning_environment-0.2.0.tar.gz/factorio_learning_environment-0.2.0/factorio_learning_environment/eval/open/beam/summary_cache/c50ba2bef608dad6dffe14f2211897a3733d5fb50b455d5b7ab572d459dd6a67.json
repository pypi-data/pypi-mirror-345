For example, you need 3 iron plates, 3 iron gear wheels, and 1 stone furnace to craft a Burner Mining Drill.\n- Ensure you have enough iron plates available for crafting Iron Gear Wheels, as the crafting process requires them.\n- Ensure you have the necessary crafting machines or smelting facilities available for the items you wish to craft. The error occurred when attempting to craft Copper Cable without the required copper plates, which cannot be crafted due to the absence of a valid recipe.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into entities\n- Ensure that you have the items available in your inventory before attempting to insert them into a furnace or any other entity. For instance, the error occurred when trying to insert coal into the furnace while having none in the inventory.\n- Ensure you have sufficient quantities of the item you wish to insert. The error occurred when trying to insert coal into the furnace without having enough in your inventory.\n- Ensure you have copper ore available in your inventory before attempting to insert it into the stone furnace. The error occurred when trying to insert copper ore while having none available.\n\n### Errors when extracting items from entities\n- Ensure that the entity you are trying to extract from contains the item you wish to extract. The error occurred when trying to extract iron plates from the stone furnace that did not have any.\n- Avoid repeatedly attempting to extract items when the entity is known to be empty. The errors occurred when trying to extract iron plates from the stone furnace that had no iron plates available.\n\n### Errors when setting recipes for entities\n- Ensure that the entity you are trying to set a recipe for exists and is capable of having its recipe set. The error occurred when attempting to set the recipe to copper plate on the stone furnace, which was not recognized as a valid target.\n- Verify that the recipe you are trying to set is compatible with the entity. The error occurred when trying to set the recipe to stone brick on the stone furnace, which was not a valid target.\n\n### Errors when trying to find nearby entities\n- Ensure that the entity you are trying to find (e.g., electric pole) exists on the surface before attempting to locate it. The error occurred when trying to find the nearest small electric pole, which was not present.\n- Ensure that the entity you are trying to locate (e.g., steam engine) exists on the surface before attempting to find it.
