{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) fueled with coal, extracting iron ore and dropping it into a chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-15.5, -48.5) and another at (-14.5, -48.5) for storing extracted iron ore.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0) fueled with coal, processing iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-14.5, -47.5) transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Fuel Management\n- Ensure sufficient coal is available in the inventory to refuel mining drills and furnaces. Regularly check fuel levels to prevent production halts.\n\n### Errors Due to Full Storage\n- Regularly clear out the chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) to prevent mining operations from stopping due to full storage. Consider expanding storage capacity or increasing the frequency of resource extraction from chests.\n\n### Errors When Using Extracting but Being Too Far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors When Placing into a Tile Which is Occupied by Another Entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity on a tile before attempting placement."}
