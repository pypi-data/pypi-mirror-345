{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Two stone furnaces at positions (x=-16.0, y=-49.0) and (x=-14.0, y=-49.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner inserters at positions (x=-17.5, y=-48.5) and (x=-13.5, y=-47.5) to move items between furnaces and belts.\n- Transport belt from (x=-16.5, y=-48.5) to (x=-16.5, y=-46.5) connecting the furnaces to the inserters.\n- Wooden chest at position (x=-13.5, y=-46.5) for storing iron plates.\n- Iron chest at position (x=-11.5, y=-44.5) for additional storage.\n\n### Electricity Generation Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Boiler at position (x=-7.0, y=23.5) fueled by coal to produce steam.\n- Steam engine at position (x=-3.5, y=23.5) to generate electricity.\n- Offshore pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5) to supply water to the boiler.\n- Pipe group connecting the offshore pump to the boiler at positions (x=-8.5, y=21.5), (x=-8.5, y=22.5), (x=-8.5, y=23.5), and (x=-9.5, y=23.5).\n\n### Belt and Inserter Network\n- Belt group connecting various parts of the production line, including:\n  - Belt from (x=-11.5, y=-46.5) to (x=-9.5, y=-46.5) moving iron plates.\n  - Belt from (x=-8.5, y=-45.5) to (x=-8.5, y=-43.5) for item transport.\n- Multiple burner inserters at positions (x=-14.5, y=-45.5), (x=-13.5, y=-45.5), and (x=-11.5, y=-45.5) to facilitate item movement along the belts.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items without sufficient inventory\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. This will prevent errors related to insufficient items for insertion.\n\n### Errors with inserters waiting for source items\n- Check the supply chain to ensure that source items are available for inserters to pick up. This will help avoid bottlenecks where inserters are waiting for items that are not being supplied.\n\n### Errors with inserters waiting for space in destination\n- Ensure that the destination for the inserter's output has enough space to accommodate the items being transferred. This will prevent inserters from stalling due to lack of space."}
