{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n###Iron Plate Production at (0,0)\nConsists of two furnaces:\n- Stone furnace at (0.0, 0.0)\n- Stone furnace at (2.0, 0.0)\n\n###Copper Plate Production at (4,4)\nConsists of two furnaces:\n- Stone furnace at (4.0, 4.0)\n- Stone furnace at (6.0, 4.0)\n\n###Power Generation System at (-9.5, 24.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Boiler at (-2.5, 24.0)\n- Steam engine at (4.5, 24.5)\n- Two pipe groups:\n  - Water pipes connecting offshore pump to boiler (fluid system 4593)\n  - Steam pipes connecting boiler to steam engine (fluid system 4594)\n- Electric pole network connecting power to the factory (poles at x=8.5 y=2.5, 6.5, 10.5, 14.5, 18.5 and x=6.5 y=24.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Research prerequisite errors\n- Research technologies in the correct order following the prerequisite chain:\n  1. Steel Processing is needed for Automation 2\n  2. Automation 2 is needed for Fluid Handling\n  3. Fluid Handling is needed for Oil Processing\n  4. Oil Processing is needed for Plastics\n  5. Plastics is needed for Advanced Electronics\n\n### Errors when placing labs\n- Ensure the target location is:\n  - Not over water\n  - Not occupied by other entities\n  - Not in a processing state\n- Try multiple different locations if placement fails\n- Check if the area is actually buildable before attempting placement\n\n### Resource management errors\n- Monitor coal levels and replenish before completely running out\n- Keep track of ore inventory levels to ensure continuous furnace operation\n- Maintain sufficient resources for planned operations\n\n### Research system errors\n- Check if research is already completed before attempting to start it\n- Verify research prerequisites are met before attempting to start new research\n- Ensure labs are properly placed and accessible before attempting research operations"}
