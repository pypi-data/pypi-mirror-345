{"content": "The error indicates that the `set_entity_recipe` function is failing because the furnace is already working, which means it should automatically smelt copper ore into copper plates without needing a recipe to be set manually. Let's focus on ensuring that the furnace has the necessary resources and is functioning correctly.\n\nHere's a revised approach to address the issue:\n\n1. **Ensure the furnace has enough fuel and copper ore**: Check the inventory and insert the necessary items.\n2. **Verify the furnace's operation**: Since the furnace status is `WORKING`, it should process the copper ore automatically.\n3. **Check the output after allowing time for processing**: Extract copper plates if they are produced and proceed with crafting.\n\n### Revised Steps:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Ensure the furnace has enough coal and copper ore\nfurnace_inventory = inspect_inventory(furnace)\ncoal_needed = 5 - furnace_inventory.get(Prototype.Coal, 0)\ncopper_ore_needed = 5 - furnace_inventory.get(Prototype.CopperOre, 0)\n\n# Insert coal if needed\nif coal_needed > 0:\n    print(f\"Inserting {coal_needed} coal into the furnace.\")\n    insert_item(Prototype.Coal, furnace, quantity=coal_needed)\n\n# Insert copper ore if needed\nif copper_ore_needed > 0:\n    print(f\"Inserting {copper_ore_needed} copper ore into the furnace.\")\n    inventory = inspect_inventory()\n    available_copper_ore = inventory.get(Prototype.CopperOre, 0)\n    if available_copper_ore >= copper_ore_needed:\n        insert_item(Prototype.CopperOre, furnace, quantity=copper_ore_needed)\n    else:\n        print(\"Not enough copper ore available in the inventory.\")\n\n# Step 2: Allow time for smelting\nsleep(10)\n\n# Step 3: Check the furnace inventory after processing\nfurnace_inventory_after = inspect_inventory(furnace)\nprint(\"Furnace inventory after processing: \", furnace_inventory_after)\n\n# Extract copper plates if available\ncopper_plates = furnace_inventory_after.get(Prototype.CopperPlate, 0)\nif copper_plates > 0:\n    extract_item(Prototype.CopperPlate, furnace.position, copper_plates)\n    craft_item(Prototype.CopperCable)\n\n# Step 4: Attempt to craft small electric poles\ncrafted_poles = craft_item(Prototype.SmallElectricPole)\nassert crafted_poles > 0, \"Failed to craft Small Electric Pole.\"\n\n# Step 5: Place the electric pole\ntry:\n    pole_position = Position(x=4.0, y=3.0)\n    electric_pole = place_entity(Prototype.SmallElectricPole, Direction.UP, pole_position)\n    assert electric_pole, \"Failed to place the electric pole.\"\n    print(\"Electric pole placed successfully, completing the power network.\")\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"Error during electric pole placement: {e}\")\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- Ensure that the furnace has sufficient resources (coal and copper ore) to operate.\n- Allow the furnace to process the materials without manually setting a recipe, as it should handle smelting automatically.\n- Extract and use the copper plates for crafting once they are available.\n- Handle potential resource shortages by checking inventory levels before attempting to insert items.", "summary_range": "[1-160]"}
