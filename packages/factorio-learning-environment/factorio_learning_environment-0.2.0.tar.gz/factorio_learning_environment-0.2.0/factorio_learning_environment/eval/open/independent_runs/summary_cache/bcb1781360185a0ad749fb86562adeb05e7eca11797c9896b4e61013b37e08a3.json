{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo new structures have been successfully placed on the map. The agent repeatedly attempted to establish a Lab\u2014to be used for supplying Automation Science Packs for research\u2014at position (0.5, 2.5). Despite several recovery updates and reattempts (including fallback approaches for lab detection and crafting), the Lab was never successfully created or placed.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 API Usage Errors\n  - When calling get_entities, avoid using unexpected keyword arguments (such as \u201cradius\u201d) and passing positional arguments if none are accepted. Verify the function\u2019s signature before invocation.\n  \n\u2022 Lab Placement and Inventory Errors\n  - Placement failures (e.g., \u201cNo lab in inventory\u201d) indicate that the lab item was not available when attempting to place it. Confirm inventory contents ahead of placement operations.\n  \n\u2022 Lab Crafting and Ingredient Shortages\n  - Repeated crafting failures\u2014including errors from iterating over a NoneType and missing sub-ingredients (iron-gear-wheel, electronic-circuit, copper-cable, and copper-plate)\u2014suggest that the intermediary production chains are not sufficiently established. Ensure that all prerequisites for lab crafting are available and that retrieval functions return valid iterables before filtering."}
