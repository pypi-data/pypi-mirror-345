groups at (8.5, 5.5), (10.5, 4.5), (\u20139.5, 24.5) to the Boiler, (2.5, 9.5), (10.5, 9.5), (1.5, 11.5), (\u20131.5, 17.5), (0.5, 17.5), (6.5, 16.5), (\u20131.5, 21.5) and (4.5, 25.5)  \nUse-case: Transports fluids between production components; unresolved fluid connectivity persists between the Boiler and Steam Engine, exacerbated by congestion near (2.5, 21.5).\n\n### Integrated Components\nConsists of:\n\u2013 BeltGroup connecting relevant inserter and belt outputs (6 belts total)  \n\u2013 Electricity network via:\n\u2003\u2022 ElectricityGroup (id=57159) with poles at [(-10.5, -49.5), (-12.5, -48.5), (-12.5, -50.5)]  \n\u2003\u2022 ElectricityGroup (id=57162) near (3.5, 0.5)  \n\u2003\u2022 ElectricityGroup (id=57172) with poles at [(6.5, 3.5), (5.5, 8.5)]  \n\u2003\u2022 ElectricityGroup (id=57174) with poles at [(2.5, 30.5), (7.5, 26.5)]  \nUse-case: Provides overall material handling via belts and supports factory operations with an extensive power network.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 Underground Fluid Connection Failures  \n\u2003\u2013 Multiple attempts to establish underground piping between the Boiler at (2.0, 17.5) and the Steam Engine at (11.5, 27.5) have failed\u2014including two\u2010step connections via the calculated midpoint at (6.75, 22.5).  \n\u2003\u2013 Mitigation: Verify that both source and target connection points are unobstructed and capable of fluid transfer; adjust layout to reduce congestion and ensure matching fluid flow parameters.\n\n\u2022 Offshore Pump and Electronic Component Crafting Failures  \n\u2003\u2013 Repeated errors occur when crafting Offshore Pumps and Electronic Circuits due to unmet sub-ingredient requirements (the inability to produce copper cables from copper plates prevents electronic-circuit fabrication).  \n\u2003\u2013 Mitigation: Ensure sufficient supply of upstream components such as copper plates and copper cables by optimizing production recipes and consolidating resource availability.\n\n\u2022 Entity Placement and Collision Issues  \n\u2003\u2013 Failures during placement\u2014such as errors when attempting to position an Offshore Pump or Small Electric Pole (e.g., near (5.5, 0.5))\u2014result from tile occupation or insufficient spacing.  \n\u2003\u2013 Mitigation: Confirm that target tiles are free prior to placement and adjust spacing or placement direction to avoid collisions.\n\n\u2022 Component Extraction Failures  \n\u2003\u2013 Persistent errors extracting copper cables from the assembling machine (at 3.5, 0.5) hinder production progression.  \n\u2003\u2013 Mitigation: Verify that the Assembling Machine has completed production and holds a valid entity for extraction before accessing its output.\n\n\u2022 Fuel and Resource Insertion Issues  \n\u2003\u2013 Initial failures in inserting coal into the Boiler highlight inventory shortages; subsequent harvesting improved fuel levels but similar issues may recur.  \n\u2003\u2013 Mitigation: Proactively monitor and replenish essential resources to ensure smooth operation during supply insertion tasks.\n\n\u2022 Removal Operation TypeError  \n\u2003\u2013 Previously, attempts to remove obstructing PipeGroups caused a TypeError by operating on a NoneType.  \n\u2003\u2013 Mitigation: Validate the existence and iterable nature of targeted entities before performing removal operations.\n\n\u2022 Steam Engine Relocation Computation Error  \n\u2003\u2013 A TypeError was encountered during the computation of a new buildable area (treating a Position object as callable).  \n\u2003\u2013 Mitigation: Handle Position objects as data structures only; avoid invoking them as functions to correctly compute spatial parameters."}
