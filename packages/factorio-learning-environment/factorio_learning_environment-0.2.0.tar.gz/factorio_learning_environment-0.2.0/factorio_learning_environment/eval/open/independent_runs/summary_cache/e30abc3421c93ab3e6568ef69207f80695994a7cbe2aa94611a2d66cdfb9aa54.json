{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=5.5, y=21.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=5.5, y=21.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=-1.5, y=24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and the boiler to the steam engine\n\n### Lab Facility at Position (x=2.5, y=0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Lab at position (x=2.5, y=0.5) connected to power supply\n- Automation science packs inserted into the lab\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of:\n- Small Electric Poles at various positions including (x=3.5, y=20.5)\n- Connected to the steam engine and lab, providing power\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Research Setup\n- Ensure that the lab has the necessary science packs and prerequisites for the research topic you are trying to start. Verify that the research is correctly set and the lab is powered.\n\n### Errors with Insufficient Fuel\n- Maintain a sufficient supply of coal in the inventory to refuel the boiler consistently. Regularly check the fuel levels to avoid interruptions in power generation.\n\n### Errors with Lab Connectivity\n- Confirm that the lab is properly connected to the power supply and that all necessary connections are intact to ensure the lab can function correctly."}
