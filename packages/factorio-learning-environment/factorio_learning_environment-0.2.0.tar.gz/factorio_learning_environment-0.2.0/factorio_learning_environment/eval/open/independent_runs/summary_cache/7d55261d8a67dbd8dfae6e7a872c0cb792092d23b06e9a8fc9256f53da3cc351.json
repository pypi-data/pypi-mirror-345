{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) supplied with iron ore and coal.\n- Furnace at position (x=10.0, y=0.0) supplied with iron ore and coal.\n- Furnace at position (x=13.0, y=0.0) supplied with iron ore and coal.\n- Furnace at position (x=16.0, y=0.0) supplied with iron ore and coal.\n\n### Electricity Generation System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5).\n- Boiler at position (x=-1.5, y=24.0) refueled with coal.\n- Steam engine at position (x=5.5, y=21.5).\n- Pipe connections between offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine.\n\n### Lab Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab at position (x=2.5, y=0.5) connected to power with poles at various positions.\n\n### Storage and Inserter System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest at position (x=8.5, y=1.5) as the destination for inserter.\n- Wooden chests at positions (x=8.5, y=-0.5), (x=17.5, y=-0.5), (x=19.5, y=-0.5), (x=20.5, y=-0.5) storing iron ore.\n- Burner inserters at positions (x=8.5, y=0.5), (x=17.5, y=0.5), (x=19.5, y=0.5), (x=20.5, y=0.5) moving items between chests and furnaces.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Crafting Items\n- Ensure all required raw resources are gathered before attempting to craft items. For example, gather wood before crafting a wooden chest.\n\n### Errors in Connecting Pipes\n- Verify that all pipe connections between entities (e.g., offshore pump, boiler, steam engine) are correctly established. Ensure that there are no gaps or incorrect placements in the pipe network.\n\n### Errors with Power Connections\n- Regularly check power connections to ensure all entities, like labs, are receiving power. Verify that power poles are correctly placed and connected.\n\n### Inserter Errors\n- Ensure that inserters have a clear path and destination. Check that source chests or transport belts have items available for inserters to move.\n\n### Steam and Water Flow Issues\n- Confirm that water and steam are flowing properly between the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine. Check for blockages or incorrect pipe connections.\n\n### Attribute Errors in Code\n- Avoid using non-existent attributes in code, such as checking for energy in an ElectricityGroup object, which may not have an 'energy' attribute."}
