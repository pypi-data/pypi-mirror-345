{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nThis facility is responsible for mining iron ore and smelting it into iron plates. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) with fuel inventory of coal, working status, and connected to:\n  - **Wooden Chest** at position (-15.5, -48.5) and another at (-14.5, -48.5) for storing mined resources.\n  - **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5) which transfers resources from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0) fueled by coal, smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-14.5, -47.5) transferring items between chests and furnaces.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage and Distribution\nThe facility includes several wooden chests for storing iron plates:\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-7.5, -48.5), (-6.5, -48.5), (-6.5, -49.5), (-5.5, -48.5), (-4.5, -48.5), and (-3.5, -48.5) with varying quantities of iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserters** at positions (-11.5, -46.5), (-8.5, -47.5), and (-11.5, -45.5) for moving iron plates between chests and furnaces.\n\n### Secondary Smelting Facility at Position (-10.0, -48.0)\nThis facility is used for additional smelting of iron ore:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-10.0, -48.0) with coal fuel, currently not smelting due to lack of ingredients.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Operations\n- **Blockage at Inserter Drop Position**: Ensure there is space at the drop position of inserters to prevent blockages. Regularly clear out items from destination chests or belts to maintain flow.\n- **Inserter Waiting for Source Items**: Ensure that the source entity has items available for the inserter to pick up. Check the inventory of source entities regularly.\n\n### Extraction Errors\n- **Failed Extraction from Furnace**: Ensure that the furnace has the required items available for extraction. Verify the quantity and type of items before attempting to extract.\n- **Incorrect Extraction Quantity**: When extracting items, ensure that the requested quantity is available in the source entity. Adjust extraction quantities based on available inventory.\n\n### General Tips\n- **Continuous Operation**: Regularly refuel entities like burner mining drills and furnaces to ensure continuous operation.\n- **Inventory Management**: Keep track of inventory levels in chests and furnaces to prevent overflows and shortages."}
