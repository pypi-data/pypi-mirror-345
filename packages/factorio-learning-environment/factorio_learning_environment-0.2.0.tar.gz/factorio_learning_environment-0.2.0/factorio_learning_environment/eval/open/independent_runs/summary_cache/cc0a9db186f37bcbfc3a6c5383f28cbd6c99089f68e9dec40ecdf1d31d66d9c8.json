{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-3.5, 6.5)\nConsists of offshore pump (position -9.5, -0.5), offshore pump (position -9.5, 2.5), boiler (position -6.5, 1.0), boiler (position 10.5, 0.0), and a network of pipes and electric poles connecting them. The pumpjack (position 17.5, 40.5) is also connected to the electricity generator via electric poles. Two steam engines have been placed at positions (0.5, -0.5) and (14.5, 2.5). The first steam engine is not properly connected to the boiler via pipes, while the second steam engine is properly connected.\n\n### Crude oil extraction at position(17.5, 40.5)\nConsists of pumpjack (position 17.5, 40.5) connected to the electricity generator via electric poles.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting entities\n- Ensure that entities are properly positioned and not blocked by other entities or terrain before attempting to connect them.\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied or unplaceable positions\n- Ensure the target location is clear of other entities and is a valid placement location before attempting to place an entity.\n\n### Errors when entities are not connected\n- Ensure that entities are properly connected (e.g., via pipes or power poles) to function as intended.\n\n### Errors due to lack of input or resources\n- Ensure that entities receive the necessary inputs (e.g., coal for boilers, fluid for pipes) to function.\n\n### Errors when attempting to place entities at positions where they already exist\n- Check if an entity already exists at the target position before attempting to place a new entity.\n\n### Errors when retrieving non-existent entities\n- Check if an entity exists before attempting to retrieve or manipulate it.\n\n### Errors when connecting pipes to steam engine\n- Ensure that the pipe is properly connected to the steam engine and that the pipe is not empty.\n\n### Errors due to AttributeError\n- Check if the object has the required attribute before attempting to access it. For example, 'PipeGroup' object has no attribute 'fluid'.\n\n### Errors when steam engine is not connected to power network or has no input liquid\n- Ensure that the steam engine is properly connected to the power network and has the necessary input liquid (steam) to function.\n\n### Errors when attempting to access non-existent attributes of entities\n- Verify that the entity and its attributes exist before attempting to access them.\n\n### Errors due to invalid arguments\n- Ensure that the arguments passed to a function are valid. For example, the first argument must be an Entity or Prototype object.\n\n### Errors when attempting to place an entity at an obstructed location\n- Check if the target location is obstructed or unplaceable before attempting to place an entity.\n\n### Errors when connecting offshore pump to boiler\n- Ensure that the offshore pump and boiler are properly connected via pipes and that there are no obstructions.\n\n### Errors due to undefined variables\n- Ensure that variables are defined before using them. For example, 'electric' is not defined.\n\n### Errors when boiler is not in inventory\n- Ensure that the required entity (e.g., boiler) is in the inventory before attempting to place it.\n\n### Errors when getting non-existent entities by position\n- Ensure that an entity exists at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it.\n\n## NAMESPACE\nNo utility functions have been defined by the agent."}
