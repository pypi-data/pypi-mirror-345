{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Plate Factory at position (0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) which is currently working and has an inventory of 5 iron ore and 100 iron plates.\n\n### Iron Ore Mine at position (42, -83)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (42.0, -83.0) which is currently out of fuel.\n- Wooden chest at position (42.5, -81.5) which has an inventory of 783 coal.\n- Burner inserter at position (42.5, -80.5) which is waiting for source items and has an inventory of 17 coal.\n- Burner inserter at position (43.5, -81.5) which is waiting for space in destination and has an inventory of 1 coal.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n- **Errors when trying to extract iron ore from the Wooden Chest**: \n  - Ensure that the Wooden Chest at (42.5, -81.5) has iron ore before attempting to extract. The current inventory shows no iron ore found.\n  \n- **Errors with burner mining drill being out of fuel**: \n  - Ensure that the burner mining drill at (42.0, -83.0) is fueled before it can operate. Check the fuel supply regularly.\n\n- **Errors with burner inserters waiting for source items**: \n  - Ensure there are sufficient items in the source (wooden chest) for the inserter at (42.5, -80.5) to operate.\n\n- **Errors with burner inserters waiting for space in destination**: \n  - Ensure there is enough space in the destination for the inserter at (43.5, -81.5) to place items.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- **Utility Functions**: \n  - No utility functions have been defined or invoked.\n\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `wood`: int\n  - `iron-ore`: int\n  - `iron-plate`: int\n  - `iron-gear-wheel`: int\n  - `coal`: int"}
