{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -49.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Coal Mining and Transport System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (42.0, -83.0) for extracting coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (42.5, -81.5) for moving coal from the mining drill to the transport system.\n- Transport Belt system at positions (43.5, -82.5) and (43.5, -80.5) for transporting coal.\n\n### Belt Group\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Belt from position (42.5, -82.5) to (44.5, -82.5) in the RIGHT direction.\n- Belt from position (43.5, -81.5) to (43.5, -79.5) in the DOWN direction.\n- Belt from position (43.5, -80.5) to (42.5, -79.5) in the LEFT direction.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities on Occupied Tiles\n- Ensure that the target tile is unoccupied before attempting to place an entity. This will prevent placement errors such as those encountered with the Wooden Chest and Burner Inserter at various positions.\n\n### Errors with Output Blockage\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity available to accept the output from the mining drill. This will prevent the \"output blocked by item on the ground\" warning.\n\n### Errors with Full Chests\n- Regularly check and empty chests to prevent them from becoming full, which can halt the production process. This will address warnings such as \"chest is full\" encountered by the Burner Inserter.\n\n### Errors with Missing Ingredients\n- Ensure that all necessary ingredients are available for the production process to avoid warnings like \"no ingredients to smelt\" in the Stone Furnace."}
