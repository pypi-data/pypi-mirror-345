Welcome to CleanTiPy documentation!
===================================

.. only:: html

   **CleanTiPy** is a Python library implementing the CLEAN-T algorithm as depicted 
   in `Cousson et al. <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jsv.2018.11.026>`_ and 
   `Leiba et al. <https://www.bebec.eu/fileadmin/bebec/downloads/bebec-2022/papers/BeBeC-2022-D06.pdf>`_. 
   It is based on the time-domain formulation of beamforming for moving sources.

   This library is the result of the work carried out by Rémi Cousson, Quentin Leclère and `Raphaël Leiba <https://raphael.leiba.fr>`_ 
   and is developped between the `Laboratory of Vibrations and Acoustics (LVA) <https://lva.insa-lyon.fr/>`_ of `INSA Lyon <https://www.insa-lyon.fr/>`_ and the 
   `Environmental Acoustics Research Unit (UMRAE) <https://www.umrae.fr/>`_ of `Gustave Eiffel University <https://www.univ-gustave-eiffel.fr/en/>`_ and `Cerema <https://www.cerema.fr/en>`_.

   .. note::

      This project is still under development.
      

   Principle of the method
   -----------------------

   CLEAN-T aims at adapting the CLEAN algorithm in time domain. 
   Visit section :doc:`principle` for more detail on the principle of the method and section :doc:`structure` for a deep dive in the implementation.

   Usage
   -----

   Check out the :doc:`usage` section to know the required packages, how to install the code and how to use it. :ref:`Examples <ExampleSection>` are also provided.
