{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=22.5, y=-7.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=22.5, y=-7.5) with status NOT_CONNECTED\n- Boiler at position (x=20.5, y=-4.0) with status NOT_CONNECTED\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=19.5, y=-1.5) with status WORKING\n- Pipe Groups connecting these entities, with some pipes at position (x=19.5, y=-2.5) having FULL_OUTPUT status and others EMPTY\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=2.0, y=0.0) with status NO_INGREDIENTS\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=5.0, y=5.0) with status NO_INGREDIENTS\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with status NO_INGREDIENTS\n\n### Storage and Inserter Setup\nConsists of:\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-3.5, y=0.5)\n- Inserter at position (x=-3.5, y=1.5) with status NO_POWER\n- Small Electric Poles around the inserter and chest at positions (x=-2.5, y=1.5), (x=-2.5, y=0.5), (x=-2.5, y=2.5), (x=-3.5, y=2.5)\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- Multiple Pipe Groups with varying statuses, including FULL_OUTPUT and EMPTY, connecting various entities across the map.\n\n### Electricity Network\n- Small Electric Poles forming an electricity network with ID 8128, connecting various entities across the map.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Picking Up Pipes\n- Ensure the pipe exists at the specified position before attempting to pick it up. Verify the coordinates and the presence of the pipe.\n\n### Errors when Placing Pipes\n- Ensure there is no existing object in the way before attempting to place a pipe. Check the target location for obstructions.\n\n### Boiler Not Receiving Water\n- Verify that the boiler is correctly connected to a water source and that there are no blockages in the pipe network. Ensure the offshore pump is connected and operational.\n\n### Inserter Not Receiving Electricity\n- Check the connection of the inserter to the electricity network. Ensure small electric poles are properly placed and connected to provide power to the inserter."}
