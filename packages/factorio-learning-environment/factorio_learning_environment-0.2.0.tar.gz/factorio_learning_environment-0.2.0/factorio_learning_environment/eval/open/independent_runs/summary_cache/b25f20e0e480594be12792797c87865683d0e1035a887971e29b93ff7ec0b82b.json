{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (0, 0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace (position 0, 0)\n\n### Coal Supply System at position (42.5, -81.5)\nConsists of:\n- Wooden chest (position 42.5, -81.5) containing coal\n- Burner inserter (position 42.5, -80.5) that extracts coal from the wooden chest\n- Burner inserter (position 43.5, -81.5) that places coal into another entity\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at position (42, -83)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (position 42.0, -83.0) for mining copper\n\n### Additional Burner Mining Drill at position (-15, -50)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (position -15.0, -50.0)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to coal extraction\n- Ensure that there is sufficient coal in the wooden chest before attempting to extract. The wooden chest has shown a decreasing inventory of coal, indicating that it may run out soon.\n\n### Errors when using burner mining drills without fuel\n- Verify that burner mining drills have enough fuel before they are expected to operate. The logs indicate that the burner mining drill at position (42.0, -83.0) is out of fuel.\n\n### Errors with inserters waiting for items\n- Check the inventory of the source entity (like the wooden chest) to ensure it has items available for the inserter to extract. The inserter at position (42.5, -80.5) is waiting for source items.\n\n### Errors with inserters waiting for space in destination\n- Make sure that the destination entity has space available for the items being inserted. The inserter at position (43.5, -81.5) is waiting for space in its destination.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the current execution steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `stone_furnace_inventory`: dict\n- `coal_inventory`: dict\n- `burner_mining_drill_status`: dict\n- `burner_inserter_status`: dict\n- `wooden_chest_inventory`: dict"}
