{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) fueled with coal, extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-15.5, y=-48.5) used for storing extracted iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) used for intermediate storage of iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0) fueled with coal, processing iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-46.5) used for storing produced iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5) transferring iron plates from the furnace to the output chest.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when extracting iron ore from a non-existent or empty chest\n- Ensure that the target chest contains the desired item before attempting to extract. Verify the chest's inventory to avoid extraction errors.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into a full inventory\n- Check the inventory capacity of the target entity before inserting items to prevent insertion failures due to full inventory.\n\n### Errors when crafting without required resources\n- Gather all necessary raw materials before attempting to craft items. For example, gather wood before crafting a wooden chest.\n\n### Errors when placing entities without having them in inventory\n- Ensure that you have the required entity in your inventory before attempting to place it on the map."}
