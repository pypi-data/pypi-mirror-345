For example, crafting pipes requires iron plates.\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities with Insufficient Inventory\n- Verify that you have the required entities in your inventory before attempting to place them on the map. For instance, ensure you have pipes in your inventory before trying to place them.\n\n### Errors Related to Entity Connections\n- Ensure that connected entities, such as boilers and offshore pumps, are properly linked to function correctly. Check for warnings like \"no fluid present in connections\" and resolve them by adjusting positions or adding necessary connections.\n\n### Errors Related to Power Supply\n- Make sure that all electrical entities, such as inserters and labs, are connected to a power source to avoid \"not receiving electricity\" warnings. Check your electricity network connections and ensure they are complete and functional."}
