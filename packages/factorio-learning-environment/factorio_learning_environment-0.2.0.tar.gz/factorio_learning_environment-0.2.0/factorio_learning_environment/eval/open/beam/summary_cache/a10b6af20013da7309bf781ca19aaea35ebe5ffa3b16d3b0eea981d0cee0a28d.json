The new stone furnace at (0.0, 0.0) is operational, processing iron ore into iron plates.\n2. The existing furnace at (-1.0, 2.0) has fuel but no ingredients to smelt.\n3. The last furnace at (1.0, 2.0) is out of fuel and has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Next Steps\nNow, we need to wait for the new stone furnace to smelt the remaining iron ore into iron plates. Once it has completed the smelting process, we can check our total inventory of iron plates and proceed to craft the burner mining drill.\n\nLet's wait for a short duration to allow the furnace to process the iron ore.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Wait for a short period to allow the stone furnace to process the iron ore\nfor _ in range(10):  # Checking over 10 seconds\n    sleep(1)  # Waits 1 second between checks\n    new_furnace_status = inspect_inventory(new_furnace)\n    \n    if new_furnace_status.get(Prototype.IronPlate, 1) >= 1:  # Check if any iron plates were produced\n        print(\"Iron plate(s) are ready for extraction from the new furnace.\")\n        break\nelse:\n    print(\"Smelting timeout - check fuel and inputs for the new furnace.\")  # If we didn't find iron plates after 10 seconds\n\n# Check for produced iron plates in the new stone furnace\nprint(f\"New Stone Furnace Inventory after waiting: {inspect_inventory(new_furnace)}\")", "summary_range": "[1-110]"}
