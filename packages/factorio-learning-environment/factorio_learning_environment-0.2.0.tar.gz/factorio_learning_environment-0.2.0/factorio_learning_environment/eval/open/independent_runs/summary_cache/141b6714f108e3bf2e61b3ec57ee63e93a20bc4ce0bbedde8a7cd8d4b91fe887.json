{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nCurrently, there are no structures on the map as all placement attempts have failed. The agent has not successfully placed any entities or constructed any structures.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when attempting to place entities on non-buildable tiles\n- Ensure that the tile is buildable before attempting to place any entity. Verify the buildability of the position using the game's API or visual indicators.\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied or restricted areas\n- Check for global build restrictions and ensure that the target position is not occupied by another entity or restricted by game rules before placing an entity.\n\n### Errors due to lack of resources or incorrect placement\n- Ensure that the necessary resources are available and that the placement position is suitable for the intended entity. For example, ensure coal is available and the furnace is placed correctly to function.\n\n### General placement errors\n- Before placing any entity, confirm that the intended position is clear, buildable, and adheres to any environmental or game-specific constraints."}
