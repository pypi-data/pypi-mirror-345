{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at Position(-15.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (-15.0, -48.0) with status WORKING.\n- Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0) with status WORKING.\n- Furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0) with status NO_INGREDIENTS.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage Facility at Position(4.0, -60.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (4.0, -60.0) with status WORKING, dropping items at position (4.5, -58.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (4.5, -58.5) containing iron ore.\n- Additional Wooden Chests at positions (5.5, -60.5), (7.5, -60.5), (6.5, -60.5), (9.5, -60.5), (8.5, -60.5), and (-14.5, -50.5) for storage purposes.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors due to Full Chest at Drop Position\n- Ensure to regularly empty the chest at position (4.5, -58.5) to prevent the burner mining drill from halting due to a full drop position.\n\n### Errors due to No Ingredients in Furnace\n- Ensure that furnaces have a continuous supply of ingredients to maintain production. The furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0) is currently not operational due to a lack of ingredients.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided logs.\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the current inventory of items such as 'wooden-chest', 'coal', 'iron-plate', and 'iron-gear-wheel'.\n  - `burner_mining_drill_status`: EntityStatus - Indicates the operational status of the burner mining drill.\n  - `furnace_status`: EntityStatus - Indicates the operational status of the furnaces.\n"}
