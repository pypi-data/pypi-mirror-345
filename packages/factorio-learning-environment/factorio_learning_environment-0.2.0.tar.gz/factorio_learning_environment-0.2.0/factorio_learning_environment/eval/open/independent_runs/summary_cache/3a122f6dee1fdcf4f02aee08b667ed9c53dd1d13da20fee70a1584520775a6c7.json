Check for any obstacles or incorrect coordinates that may prevent a successful connection.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Verify that the source from which the inserter is supposed to pick up items is stocked with the necessary items. Ensure that the inserter's pickup position is correctly aligned with the source entity.\n\n### Errors with Furnaces Having No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Make sure that furnaces have the required ingredients in their source inventory to perform smelting operations. Check the supply chain to ensure that raw materials are being delivered to the furnaces.\n\n### Errors with Mining Drills Running Out of Fuel\n- Regularly refuel mining drills to prevent them from stopping due to lack of fuel. Monitor fuel levels and automate refueling if possible to maintain continuous operation."}
