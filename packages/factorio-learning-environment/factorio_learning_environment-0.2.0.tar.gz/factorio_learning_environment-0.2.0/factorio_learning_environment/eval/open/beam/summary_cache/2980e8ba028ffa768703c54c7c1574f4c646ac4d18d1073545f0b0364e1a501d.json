{"content": "\"\"\"\nThe latest attempt to load Copper Ore into the active furnace has resulted in the following:\n\n### Active Furnace Output Status:\n- The furnace currently shows **2 pieces of Copper Ore**, indicating that it did not process any Copper Ore despite being loaded.\n- It still holds **18 Iron Plates** and is in a **\"WORKING\"** status.\n\n### Overall Inventory Overview:\n- **Current Inventory**:\n  - 4 pieces of stone furnaces\n  - 7 pieces of coal remaining\n  - 5 pieces of iron ore\n  - **3 pieces of copper ore** remaining in my inventory (after this loading).\n  - **3 pieces of iron plates**.\n\n### Observations:\n- The active furnace is operational but is not engaging in the smelting process for Copper Ore as expected.\n- This pattern of behavior suggests a persistent issue with the furnace's ability to process Copper Ore, as it has repeatedly failed to convert it into Copper Plates.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Extract Remaining Copper Ore**: I will need to extract the remaining **2 pieces of Copper Ore** from the furnace to reset its state entirely.\n2. **Investigate Smelting Issues**: Assess potential smelting issues both with the furnace and the Copper Ore input to understand why processing is failing.\n\nLet\u2019s proceed by extracting the remaining **2 pieces of Copper Ore** from the furnace and reassessing the situation once again. \n\"\"\"\n\n# Extract the remaining Copper Ore from the active furnace\nextract_item(Prototype.CopperOre, active_furnace, quantity=2)  # Remove the remaining Copper Ore from the furnace \n\n# Check the inventory status of the furnace after extraction\nactive_furnace_inventory_status_after_extraction = inspect_inventory(active_furnace)  # Inspect the status of the furnace post-extraction\noverall_inventory_after_extraction = inspect_inventory()  # Check total inventory after extraction.\n\nprint(f\"Active Furnace inventory status after extraction: {active_furnace_inventory_status_after_extraction}\")  # Status of the furnace after extracting copper\nprint(f\"Overall current inventory after extraction: {overall_inventory_after_extraction}\")  # Total inventory after extraction\nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")  # Review entities available on the map.", "summary_range": "[1-318]"}
