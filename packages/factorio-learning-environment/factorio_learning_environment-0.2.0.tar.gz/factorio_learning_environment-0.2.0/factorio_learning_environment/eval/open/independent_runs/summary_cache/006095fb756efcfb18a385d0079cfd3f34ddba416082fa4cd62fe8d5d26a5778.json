{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (20.5, -4.0)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (4.5, -10.5)\n- Steam Engine at Position (22.5, -7.5)\n- Boiler at Position (20.5, -4.0)\n- PipeGroup connecting these entities, starting from Position (20.5, -10.5)\n- Small Electric Poles at Positions (24.5, -6.5), (24.5, -7.5), and (22.5, -4.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0) supplied with iron ore\n- Stone Furnace at Position (2.0, 0.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (5.0, 5.0) with full output of copper plates\n\n### Copper Cable Factory at Position (10.5, 0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling Machine at Position (10.5, 0.5) with a shortage of copper plates\n- Small Electric Pole at Position (10.5, -1.5)\n\n### Iron Ore Storage and Transfer System\nConsists of:\n- Wooden Chest at Position (-3.5, 0.5) for iron ore storage\n- Inserter at Position (-3.5, 1.5) waiting for source items\n- Wooden Chest at Position (-3.5, 2.5) containing iron ore and iron plates\n- Small Electric Poles at Positions (-2.5, 0.5), (-2.5, 1.5), and (-2.5, 2.5)\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Site at Position (-11.0, 20.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-11.0, 20.0)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (-11.5, 18.5) containing iron ore\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Assembling Machine Not Working\n- Ensure that the assembling machine has all the necessary resources to function. In this case, the assembling machine at Position (10.5, 0.5) is missing copper plates. Make sure to supply the required ingredients to avoid this error.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- The inserter at Position (-3.5, 1.5) is waiting for source items. Verify that the source chest contains items that the inserter can transfer. Adjust the setup to ensure the inserter has access to the necessary resources.\n\n### Furnace with No Ingredients to Smelt\n- The furnace at Position (2.0, 0.0) has no ingredients to smelt. Ensure that the furnace is supplied with the necessary raw materials to operate efficiently."}
