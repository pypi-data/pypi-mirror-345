{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -80.5)\nConsists of:\n- Wooden Chest (position (41.5, -80.5))\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace (position (-15.0, -50.0))\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position (41.0, -82.0))\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at position (x)\nConsists of following entities\n- Burner mining drill (position x1) and a furnace at position(y1)\n- Burner mining drill (position x2) and a furnace at position(y2)\n- Burner mining drill (position x3) and a furnace at position(y3)\n\n### Copper Cable Factory\nConsists of following entities\n- Burner mining drill (position x1) and a furnace at position(y1)\n- Assembling machine at position(z1) and inserter at position(a) that puts into assembling machine\n- Beltgroup (position ) that connects the furnace at position y1 to assembling machine at position(z1)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n- Errors when extracting items from the furnace:\n  - Ensure that the furnace has the required items to extract before attempting to extract them. In the recent steps, attempts were made to extract iron ore from the furnace when it was empty.\n  \n- Errors when inserting fuel into the furnace:\n  - Ensure that the furnace has ingredients to smelt before inserting fuel. The furnace showed warnings of having no ingredients to smelt multiple times.\n\n- Errors when using the burner mining drill:\n  - The chest at the drop position was full, preventing further mining. Clear the chest to allow the burner mining drill to continue working.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- Functions:\n  - `extract_item(prototype, entity, quantity)`: Used for extracting items from entities. Failed when trying to extract iron ore from the furnace that had no valid items.\n  \n- Important Variables:\n  - `extracted_iron_ore`: int\n  - `furnace`: Furnace\n  - `quantity`: int\n  - `current_inventory`: Inventory\n  - `wood`: int\n  - `coal`: int\n  - `iron_plate`: int"}
