{"content": "# Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (27.5, -7.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (27.5, -7.5)\n- Boiler at Position (20.5, -4.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (19.5, -1.5)\n- Pipe network connecting these entities\n\n### Iron Plate Production at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-11.0, 20.0) dropping iron ore into a Wooden Chest at Position (-11.5, 18.5)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0) fueled by coal\n\n### Copper Plate Production at Position (2.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (20.0, 20.0) dropping copper ore into a Wooden Chest at Position (19.5, 18.5)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (2.0, 0.0) fueled by coal\n\n### Copper Cable Factory at Position (10.5, 0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling Machine at Position (10.5, 0.5) with an Inserter feeding it\n- BeltGroup connecting the Stone Furnace at Position (2.0, 0.0) to the Assembling Machine at Position (10.5, 0.5)\n\n### Transport Belt System\nConsists of:\n- BeltGroup with inputs at Position (10.5, 4.5) and outputs at Position (7.5, 6.5)\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- PipeGroup carrying steam, starting from Position (25.5, -11.5)\n- PipeGroup carrying water, starting from Position (4.5, -9.5)\n\n### Electricity Network\n- ElectricityGroup with poles starting from Position (24.5, -7.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure the pipe network is continuous and correctly aligned between the offshore pump and the steam engine. Check for any gaps or misalignments in the pipe connections.\n\n### Inserter Output Blocked\n- Make sure there is a destination entity to accept the output from inserters. Avoid placing inserters where their output is blocked by another item or entity.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entity has items available for the inserter to pick up. Check the supply chain leading to the inserter to ensure resources are flowing correctly.\n\n### Assembling Machine Ingredient Shortage\n- Ensure that all required ingredients, such as copper plates for copper cable production, are available in sufficient quantities to avoid production halts."}
