{"content": "# Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\nCurrently, there are no structures on the map. All attempts to place entities have failed, resulting in no entities being present on the map.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure the target tile is unoccupied before attempting to place any entity. Multiple attempts to place entities such as Wooden Chests, Stone Furnaces, and Inserters have failed due to occupied tiles.\n\n### Errors when moving to positions\n- Verify that the path to the desired position is clear and valid. Errors occurred when attempting to move to positions due to invalid path requests.\n\n### Errors with string indices\n- Ensure that indices used in operations are integers. Errors were encountered due to incorrect handling of string indices, which should be integers.\n\n### Errors during remote operations\n- Confirm that remote operations are feasible and that the necessary conditions are met before attempting them. Errors occurred during remote test placements due to unmet conditions.\n\n### Errors when determining buildable areas\n- Double-check the buildable area calculations to ensure they are accurate. Despite identifying buildable areas, placement attempts have consistently failed, indicating potential miscalculations or misinterpretations of the buildable space.\n\n### Errors with pathfinding\n- Ensure that the goal position for path requests is reachable. Errors occurred when attempting to request paths to distant or unreachable locations, leading to failed pathfinding attempts."}
