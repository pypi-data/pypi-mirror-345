    Such that, on the first loop one wants to measure every two qubits, thus 1, 3, 5, ...
    Then for round 1, you start measuring at 1 until N-2 every 2 --> range(1, N-1, 2)
    Next, you measure every second qubit of the ones that are left, so, 2, 6, 10...
    So for round 2, you start measuring at 2 until N-2 every 4 --> range(2, N-1, 4)
    Next, you measure every second qubit of the ones that are left, so, 4, 12, 20..
    So for round 3, you start measuring at 4 until N-2 every 8 --> range(2, N-1, 4)
