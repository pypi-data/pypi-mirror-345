{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=17.5, y=20.5) with warnings of 'no input liquid' and 'no fluid present in connections', status: NOT_CONNECTED.\n- Boiler at position (x=1.5, y=23.0) with status: NO_FUEL, connected to multiple pipes, and has a steam output point at (x=1.5, y=21.5).\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5) with status: WORKING, supplying water to connected pipes.\n- PipeGroup for fluid system 95868, starting at position (x=3.5, y=17.5), status: EMPTY.\n- PipeGroup for fluid system 95879, starting at position (x=-9.5, y=23.5), status: FULL_OUTPUT, transporting water.\n- ElectricityGroup with poles distributed across various positions, providing electrical connections.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Fuel Management\n- Ensure that boilers have a sufficient supply of fuel to maintain operation. Regularly check fuel levels and replenish as necessary to avoid the NO_FUEL status.\n\n### Errors in Fluid Connections\n- Verify that all fluid connections are properly established to prevent warnings such as 'no input liquid' and 'no fluid present in connections'. Ensure that pipes are correctly connected to both the offshore pump and the steam engine.\n\n### Errors in Entity Connectivity\n- Check the connectivity of all entities, especially those involved in fluid and electricity systems, to ensure they are functioning as intended. Address any NOT_CONNECTED statuses by reviewing and correcting the setup of pipes and electrical poles."}
