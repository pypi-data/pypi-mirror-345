{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Consists of a stone furnace with a full fuel source of coal and a warning status of 'no ingredients to smelt'. It has produced 21 iron plates.\n\n### Pipe Group at Position (-12.5, 21.5)\n- A network of pipes connecting various positions: (-12.5, 21.5), (-11.5, 21.5), (-10.5, 23.5), (-10.5, 22.5), (-11.5, 22.5), and (-9.5, 23.5). The system is currently empty.\n\n### Electricity Group\n- Consists of electric poles positioned at: (-8.5, 17.5), (-7.5, 17.5), (-6.5, 16.5), ..., (0.5, 21.5), (0.5, 20.5), (-8.5, 22.5). The voltage is currently at 0.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Offshore Pump\n- Ensure the selected position for the offshore pump is suitable and adjacent to a water source. Multiple attempts to place the offshore pump failed due to unsuitable positions.\n\n### Errors when Placing Boiler\n- Verify the placement area is appropriate and clear of obstacles before attempting to place the boiler. Multiple attempts to place the boiler at position (-12.5, 25.5) failed due to unsuitable conditions.\n\n### Errors Related to 'Position' Object\n- When placing entities, ensure that the 'Position' object is used correctly. The error \"Failed to place boiler: 'Position' object is not callable\" indicates a misuse of the Position object."}
