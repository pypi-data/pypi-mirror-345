{"content": "I notice that we're still having issues with the mining drill. Let's try to specifically target the drill at position (-20.0, 22.0) and make sure we're close enough to interact with it. Here's what we'll do:\n\n```python\n# First get the specific drill we want\ndrills = get_entities({Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill})\ntarget_drill = None\nfor drill in drills:\n    if drill.position.x == -20.0 and drill.position.y == 22.0:\n        target_drill = drill\n        break\n\nif target_drill:\n    print(f\"Found target drill at: {target_drill.position}\")\n    \n    # Move close to the drill\n    move_to(Position(x=-20.0, y=21.0))  # Move right next to it\n    print(\"Moved next to drill\")\n    \n    # Check our coal\n    inventory = inspect_inventory()\n    print(f\"Current inventory: {inventory}\")\n    \n    # Try to insert coal\n    if 'coal' in inventory:\n        insert_item(Prototype.Coal, target_drill, quantity=5)\n        print(\"Added fuel to drill\")\n        \n        # Verify drill status\n        print(f\"Drill status: {target_drill.status}\")\n        print(f\"Drill fuel: {target_drill.fuel}\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No coal in inventory\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Could not find the target drill\")\n\n# Check final state\nprint(f\"Final inventory: {inspect_inventory()}\")\n```\n\nThis code:\n1. Specifically finds the drill at (-20.0, 22.0)\n2. Moves right next to it to ensure we're in range\n3. Checks our inventory for coal\n4. Attempts to insert the coal\n5. Verifies the drill's status\n\nWould you like me to execute this code?", "summary_range": "[1-2794]"}
