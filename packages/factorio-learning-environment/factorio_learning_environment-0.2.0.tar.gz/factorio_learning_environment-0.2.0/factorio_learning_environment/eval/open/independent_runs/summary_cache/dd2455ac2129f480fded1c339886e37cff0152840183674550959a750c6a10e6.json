{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Mining and Smelting System at (-18.0, -53.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-18.0, -53.0) - no fuel\n- Stone furnace at (-17.0, -51.0) with 4 coal and 20 iron plates\nSystem not operational due to lack of fuel in drill\n\n### Copper Mining and Smelting System at (-21.0, -73.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-21.0, -73.0) - no fuel\n- Stone furnace at (-20.0, -71.0) with 2 coal and 14 copper plates\nSystem not operational due to lack of fuel in drill\n\n### Power Generation System at (-14.5, 19.0)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, 24.5) - working and producing water\n- Boiler at (-14.5, 19.0) with 7 coal - full output\n- Steam engine at (-6.5, 19.5) - not connected\n- Multiple pipe groups in various states:\n  - One water-filled pipe group (system 17440) successfully connected\n  - Multiple empty pipe groups present\nSystem still not operational - steam connection not established\n\n### Research Lab System\nConsists of:\n- Lab with automation science packs (10)\nCurrently not operational due to no power\n\n### Unused Smelting Area\nGroup of 4 unused furnaces at:\n- (0.0, 0.0)\n- (2.0, 0.0)\n- (2.0, 4.0)\n- (4.0, 4.0)\nAll have fuel (23 coal each) but no ingredients\n\n### Electricity Distribution Network\nElectric pole network (Group ID 3384) connecting various areas but currently not operational (0 voltage)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Power System Connection Issues\n- Multiple attempts to create steam connections failing\n- Steam engine placement needs to align with boiler steam output point\n- Remove ALL pipe groups before attempting new connections\n- Create direct, minimal pipe connections instead of complex networks\n- Ensure steam connection points are clear before attempting connections\n\n### Production Line Issues\n- Mining drills are inactive due to lack of fuel\n- Maintain regular coal supply to keep production running\n\n### Pipe System Management\n- Too many redundant pipe groups being created (over 30 groups)\n- Clean up ALL pipe groups before creating new connections\n- Create minimal, direct connections between components\n- Focus on one connection at a time: water to boiler first, then boiler to steam engine\n\n### Steam Engine Positioning\n- Steam engine position must align with boiler's steam output point\n- Multiple repositioning attempts show need for precise placement\n- Verify connection points before placing steam engine\n\n### Resource Management\n- Check and maintain coal levels in production entities\n- Current inventory shows excess of pipes (1404) while lacking essential resources\n- Clear processed materials from furnaces regularly to maintain production flow\n\n### Power Distribution\n- Lab and other electrical components remain unpowered\n- Focus on completing one working power generation setup before expanding\n- Ensure both water and steam connections are properly established"}
