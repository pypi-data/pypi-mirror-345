{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll generate a report summarizing the existing structures and error tips.\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line (Position x=0-2)\nConsists of two stone furnaces working in parallel:\n- Stone furnace 1 at position(0,0) processing iron ore\n- Stone furnace 2 at position(2,0) processing iron ore\n\n### Copper Plate Production Line (Position x=4, y=4)\nSingle stone furnace setup:\n- Stone furnace at position(4,4) processing copper ore\n\n### Electronic Circuit Production Line (Position x=6.5-12.5, y=11.5)\nAssembly line consisting of:\n- Input wooden chest at position(6.5,11.5) containing iron plates and copper cables\n- Burner inserter at position(7.5,11.5) moving items from input chest to assembling machine\n- Assembling machine 1 at position(9.5,11.5) crafting electronic circuits\n- Burner inserter at position(11.5,11.5) moving finished circuits to output chest\n- Output wooden chest at position(12.5,11.5) storing electronic circuits\n\n### Power Generation System (Position x=-9.5 to -2.5, y=22.5-26.5)\nSteam power setup consisting of:\n- Offshore pump at position(-9.5,24.5)\n- Water pipe network connecting pump to boiler\n- Boiler at position(-7.0,24.5)\n- Steam pipe network connecting boiler to engine\n- Steam engine at position(-2.5,24.5)\n- Connected electricity network with small electric poles\n\n### Research Facility (Position y=28.5-31.5)\nScience pack handling system:\n- Lab (position not specified but connected to power)\n- Burner inserter at position(0.5,30.5)\n- Input chest at position(0.5,31.5) containing automation and logistic science packs\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Crafting errors for items requiring machines\n- Copper cables, electronic circuits, and science packs cannot be crafted by hand - they require appropriate assembling machines\n- Copper plates cannot be crafted by hand - they must be smelted in furnaces\n\n### Resource shortage errors\n- Monitor coal levels in boiler to prevent power interruptions\n- Ensure sufficient copper cables are available for electronic circuit production\n- Keep track of raw material requirements for science pack production chain\n\n### Production chain dependencies\n- Electronic circuit production requires a steady supply of both iron plates and copper cables\n- Logistics science pack production requires multiple intermediate products (inserters, which need electronic circuits)"}
