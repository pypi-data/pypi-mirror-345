{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-12.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0) with a fuel inventory of coal and currently producing iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5) which is responsible for transferring materials to and from the furnace. It is waiting for source items.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5) and (-15.5, -48.5) which are used for storage and are connected to the inserter and mining drill.\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) which extracts iron ore and transfers it to the connected wooden chest.\n\n### New Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-10.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnace** at position (-10.0, -48.0) with a fuel inventory of coal and currently producing iron plates. It has warnings of no ingredients to smelt.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-8.5, -47.5) which is waiting for source items and is responsible for transferring materials to and from the furnace.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-7.5, -47.5) which stores iron plates and is connected to the inserter.\n\n### Ore Storage and Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -46.5) which stores iron ore and is connected to the burner inserter at (-14.5, -47.5).\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-14.5, -47.5) which transfers iron ore from the chest to the production facilities.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Extracting from Non-Existent or Empty Entities\n- Ensure that the target entity contains the items you intend to extract. Verify the entity's inventory before attempting extraction.\n\n### Errors when Inserting Items into Full Inventories\n- Check the target entity's inventory capacity before inserting items to avoid insertion failures due to full inventories.\n\n### Errors due to Lack of Ingredients for Smelting\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Regularly check and replenish the furnace source inventory to maintain continuous production.\n\n### Errors when Refueling without Available Fuel\n- Verify that you have sufficient fuel in your inventory before attempting to refuel any entity to prevent refueling errors."}
