{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Coal Mining Operation at (x=16.0, y=0.0) and (x=18.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner mining drill** at (x=16.0, y=0.0) with a **wooden chest** at (x=16.5, y=1.5) for coal storage.\n- **Burner mining drill** at (x=18.0, y=0.0) with a **wooden chest** at (x=18.5, y=1.5) for coal storage.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Placement Errors\n- **Cannot place burner-inserter due to collision or invalid position**  \n  - Ensure the target position is free of obstacles (e.g., mining drills, chests, or terrain).  \n  - Adjust spacing or direction when placing next to existing entities.  \n\n- **Transport belts cannot connect directly to wooden chests**  \n  - Use an inserter to transfer items from a chest to a belt.  \n\n- **Placing entities too far from the player**  \n  - Move closer to the target position before placing entities (max distance is 10 tiles).  \n\n#### Repeated Mistakes\n- **Multiple failed attempts to place burner-inserters at (16.5, 0.5)**  \n  - The position is blocked by the mining drill at (16.0, 0.0).  \n  - Choose a different placement location or remove obstructing entities first.  \n\n- **Incorrect belt connection logic**  \n  - Always use inserters to bridge between chests and belts.  \n\n#### General Tips  \n- **Verify entity placement feasibility before execution** to avoid wasted actions.  \n- **Check player proximity** when placing or interacting with entities.  \n- **Plan inserter placement carefully** to avoid collisions with existing structures.  \n\n(No **NAMESPACE** section as no custom functions were defined.)"}
