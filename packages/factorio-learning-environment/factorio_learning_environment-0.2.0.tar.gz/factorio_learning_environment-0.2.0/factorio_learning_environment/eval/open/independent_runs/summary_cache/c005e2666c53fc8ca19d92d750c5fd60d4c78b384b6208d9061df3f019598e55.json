{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (52.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (52.0, -82.0) extracting coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (53.5, -80.5) storing extracted coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (52.5, -79.5) transferring coal from the chest at (53.5, -80.5) to another chest at (52.5, -78.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -78.5) storing coal for further use.\n- Burner Inserter at position (52.5, -76.5) waiting for source items, indicating a potential blockage or lack of items.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility at Position (-12.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-12.0, -51.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-11.5, -49.5) storing iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-11.5, -48.5) transferring items from the chest at (-11.5, -49.5).\n- Burner Inserter at position (-8.5, -48.5) waiting for source items, indicating a potential blockage or lack of items.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -46.5) waiting for source items, indicating a potential blockage or lack of items.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-13.5, -45.5) potentially involved in the transfer process.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the inserters have a continuous supply of items to transfer. Check for blockages or missing items in the supply chain.\n- Verify that the source entities (e.g., chests or furnaces) have the required items for the inserters to operate.\n\n### Full Chest Warning\n- Regularly empty the chest at position (-11.5, -49.5) to prevent mining operations from halting due to storage capacity issues.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions**: None defined in the logs.\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `current_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the current inventory of various items such as 'wooden-chest', 'wood', 'coal', 'iron-ore', and 'iron-plate'.
