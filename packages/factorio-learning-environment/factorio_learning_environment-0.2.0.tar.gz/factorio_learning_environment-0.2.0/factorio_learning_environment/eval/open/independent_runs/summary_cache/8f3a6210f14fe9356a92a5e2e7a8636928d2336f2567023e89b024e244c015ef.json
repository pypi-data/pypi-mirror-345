{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\u2022 No new structures have been successfully constructed on the map. Multiple recovery attempts were made to supply Automation Science Packs by placing a Lab at (0.5, 2.5), but all lab placement and crafting trials failed because no Lab existed in the inventory and required sub\u2010ingredients (such as iron\u2010gear\u2010wheels, electronic circuits, and copper cables) were missing. \n\u2022 Although the agent retrieved references to existing furnaces\u2014one at Position(5.0, 5.0) used for smelting iron ore into iron plates and another at Position(\u201327.0, \u201360.0) used for copper ore smelting\u2014these were not created by the agent and no new production structure has been added.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 get_entities API usage errors\n\u2003\u2013 When retrieving entities, ensure the function is called with the correct parameters. Avoid using unsupported keywords (like \u201cradius\u201d) and supplying unexpected positional arguments.\n\u2022 Lab placement failures\n\u2003\u2013 Confirm that the Lab item is present in the inventory before attempting placement and verify that the target position is valid and unoccupied.\n\u2022 Iteration on a None value\n\u2003\u2013 Always check that the result from an entity-retrieval call isn\u2019t None before iterating over it; use a fallback (such as an empty list) when no entities are returned.\n\u2022 Lab crafting resource shortages\n\u2003\u2013 Before crafting a Lab, verify the complete resource chain. Ensure that sufficient sub-ingredients (e.g. iron-gear-wheels, copper-cables, and electronic circuits) are available by establishing proper intermediary production (smelting for iron plates and copper plates, followed by processing into gears and circuits)."}
