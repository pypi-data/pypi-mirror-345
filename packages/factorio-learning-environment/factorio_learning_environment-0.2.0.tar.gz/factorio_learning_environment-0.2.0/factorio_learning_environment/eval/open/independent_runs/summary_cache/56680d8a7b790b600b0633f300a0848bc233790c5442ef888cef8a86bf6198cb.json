{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nThis structure is responsible for mining iron ore and smelting it into iron plates. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and deposits it into a connected chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates, but currently not receiving iron ore due to inserter setup issues.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Alignment and Iron Ore Transfer\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly aligned to transfer iron ore from the chest to the furnace. Reposition and align inserters as necessary to maintain a continuous flow of resources.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Not Receiving Iron Ore\n- Check the inserter setup to ensure that the furnace receives iron ore. The inserter must be properly aligned and have a clear path to transfer resources to the furnace.\n\n### Errors with Resource Management\n- Regularly check and refuel the mining drill and inserter with coal to prevent interruptions in operation.\n- Monitor the chest inventory to prevent it from becoming full, which would halt the mining process. Empty the chest regularly to maintain mining operations.\n\n### Errors with Insufficient Fuel\n- Maintain a sufficient supply of coal in the inventory to refuel the mining drill and inserter as needed. Harvest coal regularly to avoid running out of fuel."}
