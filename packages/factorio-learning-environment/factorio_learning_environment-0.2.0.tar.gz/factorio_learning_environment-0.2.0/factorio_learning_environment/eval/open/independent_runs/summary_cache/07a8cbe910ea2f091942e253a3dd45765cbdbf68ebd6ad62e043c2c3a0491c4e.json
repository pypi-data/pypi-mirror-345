{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) extracting coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5) storing extracted coal.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-20.0, -70.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) extracting copper ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -70.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-18.0, -70.0) with no ingredients to smelt and full fuel source.\n- Transport Belt network connecting the mining drill to the furnaces.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden Chests at positions (-14.5, -54.5) and (-12.5, -54.5) for storage.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5) transferring iron ore.\n- Transport Belt network facilitating ore movement.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage Facility at Position (-16.5, -64.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -65.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-17.5, -64.5) transferring iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-16.5, -64.5) storing iron plates.\n\n### Miscellaneous Storage Chests\n- Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5) storing coal, iron ore, and iron plates.\n- Multiple empty wooden chests at various positions for potential future use.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with BeltGroup Attribute\n- Ensure that the BeltGroup object has the correct attributes before accessing them. The attribute 'output_position' does not exist for BeltGroup. Check the documentation or implementation to use the correct attributes.\n\n### Errors in Transport Belt Connections\n- Verify transport belt connections to ensure they are properly aligned and connected. Use valid attributes and methods to check belt positions and connections.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Operations\n- Ensure inserters have access to source items and are correctly positioned to transfer items between entities. Check inserter status and warnings for troubleshooting."}
