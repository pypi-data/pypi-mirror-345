{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) responsible for extracting iron ore. It is currently out of fuel and has a warning indicating that the chest at the drop position is full.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) which stores the extracted iron ore. It currently contains 32 units of iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) intended to transfer iron ore from the chest to the furnace. It is currently out of fuel and waiting for source items.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0) which is supposed to smelt the iron ore into iron plates. It currently has coal as fuel but is not receiving iron ore, hence it has a warning for no ingredients to smelt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Alignment and Fueling Issues\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items from the chest to the furnace. Verify that the pickup and drop positions are correctly set.\n- Regularly refuel the inserter to maintain its operation. An out-of-fuel inserter will not transfer items.\n\n### Mining Drill and Chest Management\n- The chest at the mining drill's drop position is full. Regularly extract items from the chest to prevent mining operations from halting.\n- Ensure the mining drill is refueled to continue extracting resources.\n\n### Furnace Input Management\n- The furnace is not receiving iron ore due to misalignment or fueling issues with the inserter. Check the inserter setup to ensure it is operational and correctly transferring items.\n- Regularly check the furnace's fuel status and ensure it has the necessary ingredients to process."}
