{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (8.5, 36.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (8.5, 36.5)\n- Boiler at position (-44.5, -123.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-45.5, -124.5)\n- PipeGroups connecting various fluid systems\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -73.0)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (9.0, -64.0)\n\n### Additional Stone Furnace\n- Stone Furnace at position (6.0, -62.0)\n\n### Inserter and Storage System\nConsists of:\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (7.5, -61.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (6.5, -59.5)\n\n### Research Lab\n- Lab with input of automation science packs, positioned within the electrical network\n\n### Electricity Network\n- Electricity Group with poles at various positions, currently not supplying power\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Boiler Not Receiving Water\n- Ensure that the boiler is correctly connected to a water source. Check the connections between the offshore pump and the boiler to ensure there are no gaps or misalignments.\n\n### Steam Engine Not Connected to Power Network\n- Verify that the steam engine is properly connected to the power network. Ensure that all necessary electrical poles are in place and connected.\n\n### Inserter Not Receiving Electricity\n- Check the connections of the inserter to the power network. Ensure that the inserter is within the range of an active power pole.\n\n### Furnaces with No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Ensure that the furnaces have the necessary ingredients to process. Check the supply lines and inserters feeding into the furnaces to ensure they are operational."}
