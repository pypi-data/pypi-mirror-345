{"content": "The error message indicates that the attempt to insert coal into the stone furnace failed because the furnace's inventory is full. This is a common issue when managing inventories in Factorio, and there are several strategies to address it:\n\n### Tips for Managing Inventory in Factorio\n\n1. **Check Inventory Capacity**: Before inserting items into any entity, check its current inventory capacity to ensure there's enough space for the items you want to insert.\n\n2. **Partial Insertion**: If the inventory is full or nearly full, attempt to insert only as many items as the inventory can accommodate. You can calculate the available space and adjust the quantity accordingly.\n\n3. **Clear Inventory**: If possible, remove any unnecessary items from the furnace's inventory to make room for the desired items. This might involve moving items to your character's inventory or another storage entity.\n\n4. **Use Multiple Furnaces**: If one furnace is insufficient to handle the desired quantity of resources, consider using multiple furnaces to distribute the load.\n\n5. **Automate Inventory Management**: Use inserters and belts to automate the process of adding and removing items from furnaces, which can help maintain optimal inventory levels.\n\n### Example Code to Handle Inventory Full Error\n\nHere's a revised version of the code that checks the furnace's inventory before attempting to insert coal:\n\n```python\ntry:\n    # Check the furnace's inventory before inserting coal\n    furnace_inventory = inspect_entity_inventory(furnace)\n    available_space_for_coal = furnace_inventory.get_free_slots(Prototype.Coal)\n\n    # Insert only as much coal as can fit\n    coal_to_insert = min(coal_for_furnace, available_space_for_coal)\n    if coal_to_insert > 0:\n        insert_item(Prototype.Coal, furnace, quantity=coal_to_insert)\n    else:\n        print(\"No space available for coal in the furnace.\")\n\n    # Insert iron ore similarly\n    available_space_for_iron_ore = furnace_inventory.get_free_slots(Prototype.IronOre)\n    iron_ore_to_insert = min(iron_ore_quantity, available_space_for_iron_ore)\n    if iron_ore_to_insert > 0:\n        insert_item(Prototype.IronOre, furnace, quantity=iron_ore_to_insert)\n    else:\n        print(\"No space available for iron ore in the furnace.\")\n\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"Error occurred: {e}\")\n```\n\n### Key Takeaways\n\n- **Inventory Management**: Always check and manage inventory space before inserting items.\n- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling to gracefully manage situations where operations cannot be completed as planned.\n- **Automation**: Consider automating resource management to reduce manual intervention and optimize production efficiency.", "summary_range": "[1-326]"}
