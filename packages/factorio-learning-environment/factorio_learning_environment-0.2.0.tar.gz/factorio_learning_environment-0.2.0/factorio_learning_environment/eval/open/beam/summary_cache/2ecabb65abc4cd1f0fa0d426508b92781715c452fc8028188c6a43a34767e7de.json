The new stone furnace is operational and currently working with 4 iron ore.\n2. The other furnace has 15 wood but no ingredients to smelt.\n3. The last furnace is out of fuel and cannot smelt anything.\n\n### Next Steps\n1. We need to insert the remaining iron ore into the new stone furnace to ensure it can smelt all available resources.\n2. After that, we can wait for the smelting process to complete and check how many iron plates are produced.\n\nLet's insert the remaining iron ore into the new furnace to maximize production.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Insert the remaining iron ore into the new furnace\ninsert_item(Prototype.IronOre, new_furnace, quantity=1)  # Add the last iron ore into the furnace\n\n# Check inventory after the insertion\nprint(f\"Inventory after inserting the last iron ore: {inspect_inventory()}\")\nprint(f\"Updated Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")  # Check the updated status of the entities after insertion", "summary_range": "[1-74]"}
