{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, -60.0) with a drop position at (4.5, -58.5) connected to a chest. This drill is currently working but has a warning that the chest at the drop position is full.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (5.5, -60.5), (7.5, -60.5), (6.5, -60.5), (9.5, -60.5), (8.5, -60.5), and (4.5, -58.5). The chest at (4.5, -58.5) contains 203 units of iron ore.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (-15.0, -48.0), (-13.0, -48.0), and (-11.0, -48.0). The furnace at (-15.0, -48.0) and (-11.0, -48.0) have no ingredients to smelt, while the furnace at (-13.0, -48.0) has a full output warning.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Full Output Warnings in Furnaces\n- Ensure that the output inventory of the furnaces is regularly emptied to prevent the furnace from stopping due to a full output.\n\n### Chest Full Warnings at Drop Positions\n- Regularly empty the chests at drop positions of mining drills to avoid interruptions in mining operations.\n\n### No Ingredients to Smelt in Furnaces\n- Ensure that furnaces have a continuous supply of raw materials to maintain smelting operations.\n\n### Insufficient Fuel for Burner Mining Drills\n- Keep a sufficient amount of coal in inventory to refuel burner mining drills to prevent them from stopping.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined by the agent in the provided logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `wooden-chest`: int\n- `coal`: int\n- `iron-plate`: int\n- `iron-gear-wheel`: int\n\nThese variables represent the quantities of respective items in the agent's inventory."}
