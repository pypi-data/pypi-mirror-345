{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Oil Extraction System at (17.5,40.5)\n- **Pumpjack** at (17.5,40.5) - Currently offline due to power failure (299,930 crude oil remaining)\n- **Main Storage tank** at (21.5,41.5) - Stores crude oil (currently holding 53.8 crude oil)\n- **Remote Storage tank** at (15.5,35.5) - Additional storage (currently holding 16.2 crude oil)\n- Connected by underground PipeGroup (fluid_system=1900) for crude oil transport\n\n### Power Generation System at (26.5,42.0)\n- **Offshore pump** at (-11.5,21.5) - Provides water (currently operational)\n- **Boiler** at (26.5,42.0) - Out of fuel (0 coal remaining)\n- **Steam engine** at (29.5,42.5) - Running at 64% capacity (8,700 power)\n- Connected by:\n  - PipeGroup (fluid_system=1893) for water transport\n  - PipeGroup (fluid_system=1905) for steam transport\n- Powered by electricity group (id=950) with 6 small electric poles\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Critical power system failures\n- Boiler completely out of fuel (0/50 coal remaining)\n- Pumpjack offline due to power failure (EntityStatus.NO_POWER)\n- Steam engine predicted shutdown in 2 minutes\n- Solutions:\n  - Immediate fuel replenishment required\n  - Implement automated fuel monitoring system\n  - Maintain minimum fuel buffer (recommend 20+ coal)\n\n### Fluid network monitoring\n- Water network (ID 1893) operational but boiler inactive\n- Crude oil network (ID 1900) intact but extraction halted\n- Steam network (ID 1905) empty due to boiler inactivity\n- Solutions:\n  - Restore power generation to resume fluid flows\n  - Monitor network IDs for troubleshooting\n\n### Storage system errors\n- KeyError when accessing storage tank data\n- Solutions:\n  - Verify tank connections before querying\n  - Implement error handling for fluid box access\n\n### Maintenance procedures\n- Current issues highlight need for:\n  1. Automated fuel alerts\n  2. Backup power systems\n  3. Emergency protocols documentation\n  4. Regular system health checks\n\n### General optimization\n- All previous optimization recommendations still apply:\n  1. Expand storage capacity\n  2. Upgrade to electric mining drills\n  3. Implement circuit monitoring\n  4. Add backup power generation\n\n### Placement verification\n- Continue verifying clear space before placement attempts\n- Maintain proper spacing between critical infrastructure\n- Document all network connections for faster troubleshooting"}
