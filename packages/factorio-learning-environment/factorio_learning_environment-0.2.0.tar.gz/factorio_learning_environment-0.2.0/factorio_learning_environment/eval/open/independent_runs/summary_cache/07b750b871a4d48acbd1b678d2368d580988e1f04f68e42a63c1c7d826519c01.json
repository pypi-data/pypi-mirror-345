{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Structure at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5) storing extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5) transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0) intended for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities due to collisions\n- Ensure there is enough space and no blocking entities when placing new entities. Consider adjusting the spacing, direction, or reference position to avoid collisions with existing entities.\n\n### Errors with inserter setup not transferring items\n- Verify that the inserter's pickup and drop positions are correctly aligned with the intended source and destination entities. Ensure the inserter is fueled and positioned correctly to facilitate the transfer of items.\n\n### Furnace not receiving ingredients\n- Check the inserter setup and ensure it is correctly aligned and operational to transfer iron ore from the chest to the furnace. Make sure the furnace is within the inserter's drop position range and that the inserter is properly fueled."}
