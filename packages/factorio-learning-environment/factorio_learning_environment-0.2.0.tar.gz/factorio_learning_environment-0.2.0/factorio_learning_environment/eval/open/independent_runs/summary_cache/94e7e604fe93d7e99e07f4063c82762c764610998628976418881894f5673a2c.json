{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-10.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) connected via a belt group\n- Stone Furnace at position (-10.0, -50.0)\n- Burner Inserter at position (-10.5, -48.5) transferring materials to the furnace\n- Wooden Chest at position (-8.5, -49.5) for storage\n- Additional Burner Inserters at positions (-7.5, -49.5) and (-5.5, -49.5) for material handling\n- BeltGroup connecting the mining drill to the furnace and chest\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to insufficient inventory items\n- Ensure you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities. Check your inventory levels regularly to avoid such errors.\n\n### Errors when connecting belts directly to non-belt entities\n- Belts cannot be connected directly to entities like Wooden Chests or Stone Furnaces. Use inserters to facilitate the transfer of items between belts and these entities.\n\n### Iron plate production issues\n- Investigate the supply chain to ensure all necessary materials are being delivered to the furnace. Check if the mining drill is operational and if the furnace has the required ingredients for smelting."}
