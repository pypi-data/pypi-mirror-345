{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Plate Production Facility at position (x=2.0, y=-63.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner mining drill** at position (x=2.0, y=-63.0) for extracting iron ore.\n- **Stone furnace** at position (x=4.0, y=-63.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner inserter** at position (x=3.5, y=-61.5) for transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Wooden chest** at position (x=2.5, y=-61.5) for storing iron ore before smelting.\n- **Wooden chest** at position (x=4.5, y=-61.5) for storing iron ore.\n\n#### Additional Stone Furnace at position (x=6.0, y=-63.0)\n- **Stone furnace** at position (x=6.0, y=-63.0) currently idle due to lack of ingredients.\n\n---\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Ensure the target tile is free before placing an entity. For example, placing a chest or inserter on an already occupied tile will fail.\n\n#### Errors when extracting from empty inventories\n- Always check if the source entity (e.g., chest or furnace) has items before attempting to extract. Extracting from an empty inventory will result in an error.\n\n#### Errors when adding fuel or ingredients to entities\n- Ensure the target entity (e.g., furnace or mining drill) has space for fuel or ingredients before adding them. Overloading an entity will cause errors.\n\n#### Errors with inserter operations\n- Ensure the inserter has a valid pickup and drop position. Misconfigured inserters will fail to transfer items and may display warnings like \"inserter waiting for source items.\"\n\n#### Errors with furnace operations\n- Ensure the furnace has both fuel and ingredients to operate. A furnace without ingredients will display warnings like \"no ingredients to smelt.\"\n\n#### Errors with mining drill operations\n- Ensure the mining drill has fuel and is placed on a valid resource patch. A drill without fuel or resources will not function."}
