{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (5.5, 21.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at Position (5.5, 21.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-1.5, 24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting offshore pump to boiler and boiler to steam engine\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0)\n\n### Lab Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab with input for automation-science-pack and electrical connection\n\n### Electricity Distribution Network\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Small Electric Poles connecting steam engine to lab\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Attribute Errors\n- Ensure that the attributes you are trying to access exist in the prototype. For example, `Prototype.Boiler.entity_class.tile_dimensions` should be checked for existence before use.\n\n### Type Errors\n- When performing operations with variables, ensure that the types are compatible. For example, converting `ModelPrivateAttr` to a float or adding it to an integer will result in a `TypeError`.\n\n### Inventory Management\n- Before attempting to connect entities, ensure you have the required items in your inventory. For example, connecting pipes requires having pipes in your inventory.\n\n### Connection Errors\n- Ensure all necessary items are crafted and available before attempting to connect entities, such as small electric poles for electrical connections.\n\n### Name Errors\n- Double-check variable names for typos or undefined variables. For example, ensure `copper_cable_needed_for_poles` is defined before use.\n\n### Resource Management\n- Monitor resource levels to prevent running out of essential materials like coal for boilers or copper plates for crafting.\n\n### Entity Placement\n- Verify the presence of entities at specified positions before attempting operations like extraction or insertion to avoid exceptions related to missing entities."}
