{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-9.5, 24.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Boiler at position (-2.5, 24.0)\n- Steam Engine at position (-5.5, 19.5)\n- Pipe group connecting offshore pump to boiler and boiler to steam engine:\n  - Water pipe path: [Position(x=-9.0, y=24.5), Position(x=-8.0, y=24.5), Position(x=-7.0, y=24.5), Position(x=-6.0, y=24.5), Position(x=-5.0, y=24.5), Position(x=-4.0, y=24.5), Position(x=-3.0, y=24.5)]\n  - Steam pipe path: [Position(x=-2.5, y=24.0), Position(x=-2.5, y=23.0), Position(x=-2.5, y=22.0), Position(x=-2.5, y=21.0), Position(x=-2.5, y=20.0)]\n- Pipe group at position (-4.5, 16.5) and (-9.5, 23.5)\n- Electricity group at position (-5.4, 20.0)\n\n### Stone Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Currently has no ingredients.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure that the pipes are correctly aligned and connected between the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine. Verify the expected paths and ensure no obstructions are present.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Fuel\n- Make sure to supply the boiler with fuel (such as coal) to ensure it operates correctly.\n\n### Errors in Electric Network Connection\n- Ensure that the electricity network is properly connected and that all components are plugged in. Verify that small electric poles are available in the inventory before attempting to place them.\n\n### Inventory Management Errors\n- Ensure that the required items, such as small electric poles, are available in the inventory before attempting to place them. Craft necessary items if they are not available.\n\n### Errors with No Ingredients in Stone Furnace\n- Supply the stone furnace with the necessary ingredients to begin processing."}
