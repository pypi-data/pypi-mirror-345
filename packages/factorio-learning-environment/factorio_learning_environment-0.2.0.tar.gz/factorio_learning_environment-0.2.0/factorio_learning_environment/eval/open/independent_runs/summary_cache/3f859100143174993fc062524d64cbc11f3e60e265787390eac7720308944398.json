{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\nConsists of offshore pump (position -9.5, 24.5), boiler (position not specified), and steam engine (position not specified). The offshore pump extracts water for the boiler, which in turn is used to generate electricity via the steam engine.\n\n### Copper plate factory at position (x=1.0, y=1.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace (position 1.0, 1.0) that processes iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner inserter (position 8.5, 1.5) that transfers items between the furnace and the lab.\n- Lab (position 6.5, 1.5) that requires power to conduct research.\n- Additional furnaces and chests (positions 10.0, 1.0 and 3.5, 1.5) that manage resources and outputs.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing new electric poles\n- Ensure the target location for placing electric poles is clear of other entities or terrain obstacles (like water). If the location is blocked, remove the blocking entities first.\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities\n- Ensure that the specified position for retrieving entities is correct and that the entity type exists at that position. If the entity is not found, verify the position and ensure the entity has been placed correctly.\n\n### Repeated issues with electric pole placement\n- Consistently check for nearby electricity groups or other entities that might be blocking the placement of electric poles. Clear these before attempting to place new poles.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items. \n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity on a tile before attempting to place it. If the tile is occupied, find an alternative location."}
