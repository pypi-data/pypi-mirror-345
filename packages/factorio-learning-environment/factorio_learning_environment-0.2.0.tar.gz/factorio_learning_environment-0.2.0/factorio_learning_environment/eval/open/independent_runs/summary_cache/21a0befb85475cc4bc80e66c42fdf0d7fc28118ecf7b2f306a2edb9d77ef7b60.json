{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n--------------------\nNo new structures have been successfully built during these steps. Multiple attempts were made to craft and place a Lab at position (0.5, 2.5) in order to supply Automation Science Packs for research, but all such attempts failed due to inventory and resource shortfalls. The agent did interact with two pre\u2010existing smelting furnaces:\n\u2022 An iron smelting furnace located at Position(5.0, 5.0) used for converting iron ore into iron plates.\n\u2022 A copper smelting furnace located at Position(\u201327.0, \u201360.0) used for converting copper ore into copper plates.\nThese furnaces were retrieved for processing but were not constructed as new structures by the agent.\n\nERROR TIPS\n-----------\n\u2022 API Call Parameters \u2013 When using get_entities, ensure that only the supported parameters are passed. Avoid extra keyword arguments (such as \u201cradius\u201d) or additional positional arguments that lead to type errors.\n\u2022 Inventory Verification for Placement \u2013 Before attempting to place a new structure (e.g. a Lab), check that the required item is present in the inventory and that the target tile is unoccupied.\n\u2022 Handling Missing Data \u2013 Validate function returns before iterating over them. For example, ensure that get_entities does not return None (or convert it to an empty list) to prevent iteration errors.\n\u2022 Resource Chain for Crafting \u2013 Lab crafting errors were caused by shortages in sub-ingredients (such as iron-gear-wheels, electronic circuits, copper cables, and copper plates). Double-check the complete set of resource prerequisites and plan appropriate smelting or production steps to meet these requirements.\n\u2022 Consistent Resource Monitoring \u2013 When a crafting failure occurs due to missing items, review inventory levels and schedule resource production (e.g. additional smelting of iron or copper) to close the supply gap before retrying a craft.\n\n"}
