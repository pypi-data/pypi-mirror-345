{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Plate Production Facility at position (x=2.0, y=-63.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner mining drill** at position (x=2.0, y=-63.0) for extracting iron ore.\n- **Stone furnace** at position (x=4.0, y=-63.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner inserter** at position (x=3.5, y=-61.5) for transferring items between the drill, furnace, and chest.\n- **Wooden chest** at position (x=2.5, y=-61.5) for storing iron ore before smelting.\n- **Wooden chest** at position (x=4.5, y=-61.5) for storing iron plates after smelting.\n\n#### Additional Stone Furnace at position (x=6.0, y=-63.0)\n- **Stone furnace** at position (x=6.0, y=-63.0) currently idle due to lack of ingredients.\n\n---\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when inserting items into a full inventory\n- Ensure the target entity's inventory has space before attempting to insert items. For example, the burner inserter at (x=3.5, y=-61.5) failed to insert coal because its inventory was full (50/50 items).\n\n#### Errors due to lack of fuel in furnaces\n- Regularly check and refuel furnaces to avoid production halts. The furnace at (x=4.0, y=-63.0) ran out of fuel, causing it to stop smelting.\n\n#### Errors due to lack of ingredients in furnaces\n- Ensure furnaces have a steady supply of raw materials. The furnace at (x=6.0, y=-63.0) is idle because it has no iron ore to smelt.\n\n#### General tips for inserter operations\n- Verify that inserters are correctly positioned and configured to transfer items between entities. Misaligned or misconfigured inserters can disrupt production workflows."}
