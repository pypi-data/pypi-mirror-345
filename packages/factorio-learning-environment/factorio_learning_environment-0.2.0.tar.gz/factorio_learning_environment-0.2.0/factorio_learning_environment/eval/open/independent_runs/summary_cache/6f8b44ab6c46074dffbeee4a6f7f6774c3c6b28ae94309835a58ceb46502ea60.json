{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production at (0,0)\nConsists of two furnaces:\n- Stone furnace at (0.0, 0.0) producing iron plates\n- Stone furnace at (2.0, 0.0) producing iron plates\n\n### Copper Plate Production at (4,4)\nConsists of two furnaces:\n- Stone furnace at (4.0, 4.0) producing copper plates\n- Stone furnace at (6.0, 4.0) producing copper plates\n\n### Power Generation System\nComponents:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Boiler at (-2.5, 24.0)\n- Steam engine at (4.5, 24.5)\n- Water pipe network (fluid system 3249) connecting offshore pump to boiler\n- Steam pipe network (fluid system 3250) connecting boiler to steam engine\n- Electric pole network connecting at positions (8.5,2.5), (8.5,10.5), (8.5,6.5), (8.5,14.5), (8.5,18.5), (6.5,24.5)\n\n### Research Facility\n- Lab conducting Electronics research, connected to power grid (electrical_id=3400)\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Steam Engine Connection\n- When connecting boiler to steam engine with pipes, ensure there is a valid path between them\n- Using multiple pipe types (Underground + regular) in same connection attempt can cause issues\n- Remove old pipe connections before attempting to create new ones\n\n### Errors with Resource Loading\n- Ensure sufficient resources are in inventory before attempting to insert into furnaces\n- Check inventory levels before attempting resource-intensive operations"}
