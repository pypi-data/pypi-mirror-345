{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) for extracting iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (41.0, -80.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility at Position (-21.0, -73.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-21.0, -73.0) for extracting copper ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -71.0) for smelting copper ore into copper plates.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors due to Lack of Fuel\n- Ensure that all Burner Mining Drills and Stone Furnaces are regularly supplied with fuel to maintain continuous operation. Consider setting up a logistics system to automate fuel delivery.\n\n### Errors due to Output Blockage\n- Ensure that the output of the Burner Mining Drill is not blocked by items on the ground. Implement a system to automatically transport output to a sink entity, such as a conveyor belt leading to a furnace or storage chest.\n\n### Errors due to Missing Sink Entities\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity in place to accept the output from the mining drills. This could be a furnace or a conveyor belt leading to a processing area.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - No utility functions have been defined by the agent in the provided steps.\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the current inventory of items such as 'stone-furnace', 'coal', 'stone', 'iron-plate', and 'copper-plate'.\n  - `entities_on_map`: List[Entity] - Represents the entities currently placed on the map, including their positions and statuses."}
