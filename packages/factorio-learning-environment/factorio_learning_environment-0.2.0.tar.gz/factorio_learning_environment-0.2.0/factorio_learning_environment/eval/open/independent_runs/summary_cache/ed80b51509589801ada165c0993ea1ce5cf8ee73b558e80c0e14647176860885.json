{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Smelting Area at (0,0)\nConsists of two stone furnaces:\n- Stone furnace at position (0,0) with coal fuel, currently idle\n- Stone furnace at position (2,0) with coal fuel, currently idle\n\n### Copper Smelting Area at (4,4)\n- Stone furnace at position (4,4) with coal fuel, currently idle\n\n### Power Generation System at (-9.5, 24.5)\nAn integrated power generation system consisting of:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Boiler at position (-7.0, 24.5) containing coal fuel\n- Steam engine at position (-2.5, 24.5)\n- Connected via pipe networks:\n  - Water pipes from pump to boiler\n  - Steam pipes from boiler to steam engine\n- Electric pole network at positions (4.5,8.5), (4.5,20.5), (0.5,24.5), (4.5,12.5), (4.5,16.5)\n\n### Research Facility\n- Lab (position not specified) connected to power network, currently without power\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Resource/Recipe Availability Errors\n- Cannot craft items that require automation technology (like assembling machine 1) before researching automation\n- Wood is a raw resource that must be gathered, not crafted\n- Ensure required technologies are researched before attempting to craft items that depend on them\n\n### Inventory Management Errors\n- Verify required materials are in inventory before placing structures (stone furnace, offshore pump)\n- Ensure you have all sub-ingredients for complex recipes before attempting to craft\n- Check inventory has sufficient quantities of required items before crafting (iron plates, iron gear wheels)\n\n### Furnace Operation Errors\n- Cannot insert different ore types into furnaces that already contain another type (copper ore into iron ore furnace)\n- Ensure furnaces have both fuel and ore before expecting output\n\n### Connection Errors\n- Ensure you have required connection items (like pipes) in inventory before attempting to connect entities\n- When connecting entities, verify you have all required materials in inventory first\n\n### Power System Errors\n- Labs and other machines will show NO_POWER status until properly connected to a working power generation system\n- Ensure complete power infrastructure (generation, transmission, and connection to machines) is in place"}
