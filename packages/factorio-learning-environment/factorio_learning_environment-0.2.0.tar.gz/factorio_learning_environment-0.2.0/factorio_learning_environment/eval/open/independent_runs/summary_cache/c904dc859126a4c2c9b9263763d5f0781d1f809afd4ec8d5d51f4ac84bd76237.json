{"content": "Based on the new logs, here's the updated report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production at (-18.0, -53.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-18.0, -53.0) with drop position (-17.5, -51.5)\n- Stone furnace at (-17.0, -51.0) containing 4 coal and 20 iron plates\nCurrently inactive due to lack of fuel in mining drill\n\n### Copper Plate Production at (-21.0, -73.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-21.0, -73.0) with drop position (-20.5, -71.5)\n- Stone furnace at (-20.0, -71.0) containing 2 coal and 14 copper plates\nCurrently inactive due to lack of fuel in mining drill\n\n### Smelting Area near Origin\nGroup of furnaces each containing 23 coal:\n- Stone furnace at (0.0, 0.0)\n- Stone furnace at (2.0, 0.0)\n- Stone furnace at (2.0, 4.0)\n- Stone furnace at (4.0, 4.0)\nAll furnaces have fuel but no ingredients to smelt\n\n### Research Facility\n- Lab containing 10 automation science packs\nCurrently not functioning due to lack of power\n\n### Power Generation System (Under Construction)\nCurrent setup consists of:\n- Boiler at (-14.5, 19.0) containing 41 coal\n- Steam engine at (-14.5, 23.5)\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Multiple pipe groups scattered across the area\nCurrently not functioning due to incomplete steam connections\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement and Connection Issues\n- Steam engine connection points are being blocked by other entities\n- Ensure clear paths between connection points before attempting to connect entities\n- Remove all interfering pipe groups and individual pipes before creating new connections\n\n### Pipe System Management\n- Remove ALL pipe groups and individual pipes before starting new connections\n- Create direct, minimal connections between components\n- Avoid creating multiple parallel or redundant pipe connections\n- Verify connection points are clear and accessible before placing pipes\n\n### Steam Engine Positioning\n- Steam engine must be placed at correct distance from boiler\n- Ensure steam engine orientation matches boiler output direction\n- Leave enough space between boiler and steam engine for steam pipes\n- Avoid placing steam engine too far or too close to boiler\n\n### Component Spacing and Orientation\n- Place power components in proper sequence: boiler \u2192 steam pipes \u2192 steam engine\n- Maintain proper spacing between components to allow for connections\n- Ensure components are oriented in compatible directions\n- Keep connection points aligned and unobstructed\n\n### Resource Management\n- Mining drills and furnaces need constant fuel supply to operate\n- Maintain fuel levels in all burner devices to prevent operation interruption\n\n### Power Distribution\n- Electric poles must be properly connected to form a complete power network\n- Ensure power consumers (like labs) are within range of electric poles"}
