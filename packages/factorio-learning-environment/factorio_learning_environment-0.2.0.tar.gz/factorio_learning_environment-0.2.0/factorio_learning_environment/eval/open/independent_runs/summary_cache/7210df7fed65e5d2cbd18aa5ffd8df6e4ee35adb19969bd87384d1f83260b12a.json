{"content": "# Factorio Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(12.93, 10.71)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Electricity group (position 12.93, 10.71) - Status: NOT_PLUGGED_IN_ELECTRIC_NETWORK\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 0, 0) and a furnace (position 0, 0) - Status: NO_INGREDIENTS\n- Burner mining drill (position 2, 0) and a furnace (position 2, 0) - Status: WORKING\n- Burner mining drill (position 2, 2) and a furnace (position 2, 2) - Status: NO_INGREDIENTS\n\n### Lab at position(10.5, 10.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab (position 10.5, 10.5) - Status: NO_POWER\n\n### Wooden chest at position(5.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest (position 5.5, 0.5) - Status: NORMAL\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when trying to access non-existent entities\n- Ensure that the entity you are trying to access exists at the specified position. For example, the error for the lab at position (6.0, 0.0) indicates that no lab entity was found at that location.\n\n### Errors when using electricity but not connected\n- Make sure that your electricity-generating structures are properly connected to the electric network. The electricity group at position (12.93, 10.71) is currently not plugged in.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity on a tile before attempting to place it. This is crucial to avoid conflicts with existing entities.\n\n### Errors when entities have no ingredients\n- Check that your furnaces and other crafting entities have the necessary ingredients to function. For example, the furnaces at positions (0, 0) and (2, 2) are currently without ingredients."}
