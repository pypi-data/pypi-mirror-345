{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, -60.0) with a drop position at (4.5, -58.5). It is currently working but has a warning that the chest at the drop position is full.\n- **Wooden Chests**:\n  - Chest at position (4.5, -58.5) containing iron ore.\n  - Additional chests at positions (5.5, -60.5), (7.5, -60.5), (6.5, -60.5), (9.5, -60.5), and (8.5, -60.5) for storage.\n- **Stone Furnaces**:\n  - Furnace at position (-15.0, -48.0) with iron ore input and iron plate output.\n  - Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0) with iron ore input and iron plate output.\n  - Furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0) with iron ore input and iron plate output.\n- **Storage Chests**:\n  - Chest at position (-14.5, -50.5) for storing iron plates.\n  - New storage chests at positions (-13.5, -50.5), (-12.5, -50.5), and (-11.5, -50.5) for additional iron plate storage. The chest at (-11.5, -50.5) is full.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Full Storage\n- Ensure that storage chests are regularly emptied to prevent production halts. The burner mining drill at (4.0, -60.0) has a warning due to a full chest at its drop position.\n\n### Errors with Resource Management\n- Monitor the inventory levels of critical resources like coal and iron ore to ensure continuous operation of furnaces and drills. The furnaces are functioning but require consistent refueling and ore input.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `coal`: int, current inventory count is 55.\n- `iron-ore`: int, current inventory count is 98.\n- `iron-plate`: int, current inventory count is 5215.\n- `iron-gear-wheel`: int, current inventory count is 4."}
