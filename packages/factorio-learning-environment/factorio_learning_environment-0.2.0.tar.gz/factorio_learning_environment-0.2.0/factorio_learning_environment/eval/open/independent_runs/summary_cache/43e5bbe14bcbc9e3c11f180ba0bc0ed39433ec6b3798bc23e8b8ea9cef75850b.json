{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Plate Production at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) fueled with coal and actively working.\n- Stone Furnace at position (41.0, -80.0) with coal but lacking ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Iron Plate Production at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) fueled with coal and actively working.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) for storing mined iron ore.\n\n### Copper Furnace at Position (-20.0, -71.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -71.0) with coal but lacking ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (43.5, -79.5) for general storage.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Insufficient Inventory for Insertion\n- Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into a structure. For example, attempting to insert coal into the copper furnace failed due to insufficient coal in the inventory.\n\n### Errors Related to No Ingredients in Furnaces\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Both the stone furnace at (41.0, -80.0) and (\u221220.0, \u221271.0) are lacking ingredients, preventing them from functioning.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - `insert_item`: Used for inserting items into entities. Ensure inventory has the required items before invoking.\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `copper_furnace`: Represents the copper furnace entity used in the insertion operation.\n  - `iron_furnace`: Represents the iron furnace entity used in the insertion operation.\n"}
