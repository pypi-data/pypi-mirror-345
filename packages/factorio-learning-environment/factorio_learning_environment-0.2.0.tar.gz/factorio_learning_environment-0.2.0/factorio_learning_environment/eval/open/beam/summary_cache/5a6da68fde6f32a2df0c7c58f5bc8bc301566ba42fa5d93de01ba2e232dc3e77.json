{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone furnace at position (62.0, -54.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position 62.0, -54.0) with current fuel of 1 coal and an inventory containing 49 iron ore and 0 iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when harvesting resources\n- Ensure you are within reach of the resource patch before attempting to harvest. Move closer if necessary.\n\n### Errors related to smelting\n- Check that the stone furnace has both fuel and the required ingredients to smelt. If the furnace reports \"no ingredients to smelt,\" ensure that you have inserted the necessary items.\n- Monitor the furnace's fuel and input levels to avoid smelting timeouts.\n- The furnace may report being full of plates or lacking ore to process. Ensure that you are managing the inventory effectively.\n- The stone furnace is repeatedly reporting \"smelting timeout - check fuel and inputs.\" Ensure that the furnace has enough fuel and that the input items are available. If the furnace is full, consider removing some items before inserting more.\n\n### Errors when inserting items\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into the stone furnace. If you receive a \"No iron-ore to insert from your inventory\" error, check your inventory for the necessary resources.\n- Avoid attempting to insert items when the LuaItemStack is invalid. Ensure that the item stack is valid before performing the insert operation.\n\n### Repeated smelting timeout errors\n- The stone furnace is repeatedly reporting \"smelting timeout - check fuel and inputs.\" Ensure that the furnace has enough fuel and that the input items are available. If the furnace is full, consider removing some items before inserting more.\n\n### Errors related to fuel levels\n- Monitor the fuel levels of the stone furnace closely. If the fuel drops too low, it may stop functioning. Ensure you have a sufficient supply of fuel to keep the furnace operational.\n- Ensure to refill the stone furnace with fuel before it runs out completely. Plan ahead to maintain a steady supply of fuel.\n\n### Errors when the stone furnace runs out of fuel\n- The furnace may stop functioning if it runs out of fuel. Always keep track of the fuel levels and replenish them as needed.\n\n### Errors when extracting items\n- Ensure that the entity you are trying to extract from contains the item you wish to extract. If you receive an error stating \"Could not find a valid entity containing iron-plate,\" verify the inventory of the stone furnace and ensure it has the items available for extraction.\n- The stone furnace is reporting \"Could not extract iron-plate\" multiple times. Verify that the furnace has iron plates available for extraction before attempting to extract them."}
