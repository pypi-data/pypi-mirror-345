{"content": "It seems like the output is not providing detailed feedback on each step, which suggests that the code might not be executing as expected or there is an issue with capturing the output. Let's try a more granular approach to ensure each step is executed and logged properly.\n\nHere's a revised approach with more detailed logging:\n\n```python\nprint(\"Starting incremental diagnostics and setup.\")\n\ntry:\n    # Step 1: Check and Ensure Power Connectivity\n    assembling_machine_position = Position(x=4.5, y=0.5)\n    assembling_machines = get_entities({Prototype.AssemblingMachine1}, assembling_machine_position, radius=1)\n\n    if assembling_machines:\n        assembling_machine = assembling_machines[0]\n        print(f\"Assembling Machine found at {assembling_machine_position} with status: {assembling_machine.status}\")\n\n        if assembling_machine.status == EntityStatus.NO_POWER:\n            print(\"The assembling machine is not powered.
