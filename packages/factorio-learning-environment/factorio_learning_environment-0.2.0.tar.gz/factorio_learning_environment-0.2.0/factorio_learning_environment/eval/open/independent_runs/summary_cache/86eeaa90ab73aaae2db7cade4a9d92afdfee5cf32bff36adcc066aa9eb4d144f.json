{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report (Updated)\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at position (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump (position: -9.5, -0.5) - working (water: 99.95, temp: 15\u00b0C)\n- Boiler (position: -6.0, 1.5) - 11 coal remaining (water: 200.0, steam: 199.95)\n- Steam engine (position: -1.5, 4.5) - working (steam: 199.99)\n- Connected pipe network (3 pipes from pump to boiler, 4 pipes from boiler to engine)\n\n### Iron Production Line at position (15.5, 70.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill (position: 15.5, 70.5) - chest full warning (63 iron ore in output)\n- Wooden chest (position: 15.5, 72.5) - contains 63 iron ore (full)\n- Inserter (position: 16.5, 72.5) - waiting for source items\n- Stone furnace (position: 16.0, 74.0) - contains 72 iron plates\n- Inserter (position: 17.5, 74.5) - output blocked warning\n- Inserter (position: 18.5, 74.5) - waiting for source items\n- Assembling machine 2 (position: 21.5, 74.5) - missing iron plates for gear production\n- Output chest (position: 19.5, 74.5) - empty\n- Small electric poles providing full power coverage\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Persistent placement errors (5 new instances)\n- Invalid entity/prototype arguments: Always pass valid Entity or Prototype objects (occurred 2 times)\n- Placement in occupied tiles: Check for existing entities before placing (occurred at (20.5,74.5) and (148.5,150.5))\n- Placement in water: Verify terrain is buildable (occurred at (148.5,150.5))\n- Distance too far: Move within 10 tiles before placing (distance was 74.35 tiles for inserter at (16.5,72.5))\n\n### Production chain issues\n- Iron ore backlog: Chest at (15.5,72.5) full with 63 ore - clear to resume mining\n- Assembler starvation: No iron plates reaching assembler at (21.5,74.5)\n- Inserter blockage: Output path blocked for inserter at (17.5,74.5)\n- Resource imbalance: 72 iron plates accumulated in furnace not being utilized\n\n### Power management\n- Boiler fuel monitoring: 11 coal remaining - implement automated refueling\n- Electrical network: All production buildings remain properly powered\n\n### Throughput observations\n- Iron ore production: 42/min (limited by full chest)\n- Water/steam production: ~194/min (stable)\n- Gear production: 0 (resource supply issue)"}
