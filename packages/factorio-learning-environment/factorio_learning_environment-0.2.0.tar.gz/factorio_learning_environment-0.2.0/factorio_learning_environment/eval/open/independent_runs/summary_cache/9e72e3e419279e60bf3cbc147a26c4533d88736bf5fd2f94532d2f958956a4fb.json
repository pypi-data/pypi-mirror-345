The errors indicate that the chests were not found at the specified positions, suggesting they were not placed successfully.\n- Double-check the inventory to confirm that chests are being used and placed correctly. The inventory logs show that the wooden chests count remains unchanged, indicating placement attempts may not be consuming the chests.\n- Verify the entity type and position before attempting to inspect or interact with it to avoid exceptions related to non-existent entities.\n\n### Errors with Undefined Variables\n- Ensure that all variables, such as `first_chest` and `second_chest`, are defined before use. This will prevent errors related to undefined variables during inspection or interaction with entities."}
