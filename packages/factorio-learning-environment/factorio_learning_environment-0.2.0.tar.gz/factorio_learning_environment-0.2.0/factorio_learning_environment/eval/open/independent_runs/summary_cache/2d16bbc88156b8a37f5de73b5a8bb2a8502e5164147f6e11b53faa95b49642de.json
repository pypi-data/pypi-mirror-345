{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Automation Science Pack Production Line at (8.5, 13.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine-1 at (8.5, 13.5)\n- Output inserter (burner) at (10.5, 13.5)\n- Output chest at (11.5, 13.5)\n- Iron gear input inserter at (7.5, 16.5)\n- Iron gear chest at (7.5, 17.5)\n- Copper input inserter at (9.5, 18.5)\n- Copper chest at (9.5, 19.5)\n\n### Power Generation System at (-4.5, 16.0)\nConsists of:\n- Boiler at (-4.5, 16.0)\n- Steam engine at (-4.5, 12.5)\n- Offshore pump at (-3.5, 27.5)\n- Connected by pipe networks (fluid systems 4236, 4244)\n- Electric pole network connecting power consumers\n\n### Iron Plate Production Lines\nMultiple production lines consisting of:\n1. First line:\n   - Burner mining drill at (-28.0, -61.0)\n   - Input chest at (-27.5, -59.5)\n   - Input inserter at (-26.5, -59.5)\n   - Stone furnace at (-25.0, -59.0)\n   - Output inserter at (-23.5, -58.5)\n   - Output chest at (-22.5, -58.5)\n\n2. Second line:\n   - Burner mining drill at (-18.0, -53.0)\n   - Input chest at (-17.5, -51.5)\n   - Input inserter at (-16.5, -51.5)\n   - Stone furnace at (-15.0, -51.0)\n   - Output inserter at (-13.5, -50.5)\n   - Output chest at (-12.5, -50.5)\n\n### Coal Mining System at (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0)\n- Output chest at (41.5, -80.5)\n- Inserter at (41.5, -79.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Collision Errors\n- Check for existing entities before placing new ones\n- Increase spacing or change direction when placing entities near existing structures\n- Pay attention to error messages that indicate which entities are blocking placement\n\n### Direction Related Errors\n- Only use valid direction enums (NORTHWEST is not a valid direction)\n- Use standard directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT\n\n### Resource Management Errors\n- Ensure required items are in inventory before attempting to insert them into chests\n- Check if you have crafted necessary intermediate products before trying to use them\n\n### Power System Issues\n- Keep boilers fueled to maintain power generation\n- Monitor power consumption and generation to ensure stable operation\n\n### Inserter Setup Issues\n- Ensure proper spacing between inserters and their target entities\n- Verify inserter pickup and drop positions are not blocked\n- Consider the direction of inserter placement relative to source and destination entities"}
