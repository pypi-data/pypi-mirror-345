{"content": "The error message indicates that the assertion `assert furnaces_nearby, \"No furnace available to manage.\"` failed because no furnaces were found near the specified position. This suggests that there might not be a furnace at the exact location you are checking, or the radius used for searching is too small.\n\nHere are some steps to troubleshoot and resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Verify the Position**: Ensure that the position `(0.0, 0.0)` is indeed where you expect the furnace to be. If the furnace is at a different location, update the position accordingly.\n\n2. **Increase the Search Radius**: If you're not certain of the exact position, you can increase the search radius to ensure that nearby furnaces are detected.\n\n3. **Check for Existing Furnaces**: Before attempting to remove and replace a furnace, you can list all nearby entities to confirm the presence and position of any existing furnaces.\n\nHere's how you can adjust your code:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Move the player to the expected furnace location.\nmove_to(Position(0.0, 0.0))  # Adjust this position if necessary.\n\n# Step 2: Check the player's inventory for coal.\nplayer_inventory = inspect_inventory()\ncoal_count = player_inventory.get(Prototype.Coal, 0)\nassert coal_count > 0, \"No coal present in player inventory.\"\n\n# Step 3: List all nearby entities to verify furnace presence.\nnearby_entities = get_entities(radius=5)  # Increase the radius to capture more entities.\nprint(\"Nearby entities:\", nearby_entities)\n\n# Step 4: Identify and manage the furnace.\nfurnaces_nearby = get_entities({Prototype.StoneFurnace}, position=Position(0.0, 0.0), radius=5)\nif not furnaces_nearby:\n    print(\"No furnace found at the specified position.
