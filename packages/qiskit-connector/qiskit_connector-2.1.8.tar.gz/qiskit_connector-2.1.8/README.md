**⚛️Quantum Computing Qiskit Connector For Quantum Backend Use In Realtime**

The Qiskit Connector transforms how quantum developers connect to IBM Quantum backends by automating every step of the authentication, plan detection, and backend selection process. Instead of writing extensive boilerplate setup code for each project, developers can now seamlessly authenticate, dynamically detect whether they are using an `Open` or `Paid` plan, and instantly access the optimal backend `QPU`resource which is least-busy using a single intuitive keyword: `backend`. The connector intelligently manages quantum computing plan environment variables and Qiskit runtime service configuration for sticky reusability of QPU resources from the backend, allowing quantum developers to streamline connection workflows and immediately focus on building, testing, and scaling quantum applications.
<br><br>
By eliminating manual configurations and connection complexities, Qiskit Connector empowers developers to reduce onboarding time, minimize human error, and accelerate quantum solution delivery. The tool is especially valuable for production-grade quantum development where agility, repeatability, and secure backend access are critical. Whether working in research environments, building enterprise-grade quantum solutions, or designing novel quantum algorithms, developers can now concentrate on high-value tasks without being slowed down by infrastructure setup challenges.
<br><br>
This package performs the following:
- Loads environment variables from config file (e.g. `.env`) to configure your IBM Quantum account plan and make the `backend` object available within your quantum application code for reuse in real-time.
- Detects your active plan (Open, Standard, Premium, Dedicated) and sets up the correct channel/instance.
- It has functions to save your account using its (`qiskit_smart`), to verify QPU resources using (`qpu_verify`, `is_verified`), and retrieve a ready-to-use backend using (`connector()`). Presents you with the least-busy backend to run your quantum application code in realtime instead of you using simulators.

## 📋 Features & API

These functions are available after you import the module:

```python
from qiskit_connector import (
    connector,
    plan_type
)
```
- **`connector()`**  
  **Primary Integration Point:** Seamlessly initializes your IBM Quantum account, selects the optimal QPU (or the first available device for open/paid plans), and emits a clear diagnostics summary. It returns a fully configured `backend` object that you can immediately pass to Qiskit’s sampler, estimator, transpiler, or any circuit execution API—so you can focus on your quantum workflows rather than connection boilerplate.

- **`plan_type()`**  
  **Subscription Plan Resolver:** Automatically evaluates your environment configuration (via `.env` or system variables) to identify whether you’re operating under the **Open Plan** or a **Paid Plan**. This guarantees that your code consistently targets the correct IBM Quantum service tier, eliminating manual plan management and minimizing configuration drift.

## 🔧 Installation

```bash
pip install qiskit-connector
```

This will also pull in functionalities powered by:
- `qiskit>=2.0.0`  
  

and any other Qiskit dependencies. (Qiskit 1.x is not supported).

---

## 🗂️ Environment Variable Setup
🔐 Security Practice: Do not check-in `.env or environment variable config file` or any environment variable file into version control. Add it to your .gitignore. During development, create a file named `.env` at your project root. The connector will automatically load it.Use the template below as the content of your .env file or variable config file.

```dotenv

## 📖 Usage

### Open Plan (default free tier) and Paid Plan

```python

from qiskit_connector import connector, plan_type
from qiskit_ibm_runtime import SamplerV2 as Sampler, Session

# QPU execution mode by plan: Use of 'backend' object.
current = plan_type()
backend = connector()

if current == "Open Plan":  # session not supported
    sampler = Sampler(mode=backend)
    print("Your Plan",current)
    print("Least Busy QPU:", backend.name)
    if isinstance(backend, IBMBackend):
        print("This is a real & live QPU device")
    else:
        print("This is a simulator")
    print(f"\n")
elif current == "Paid Plan":  # supports session
    with Session(backend=backend.name) as session:
        sampler = Sampler(mode=session)
        print("Your Plan",current)
        print("Least Busy QPU:", backend.name)
        if isinstance(backend, IBMBackend):
            print("This is a real & live QPU device")
        else:
            print("This is a simulator")
        print(f"\n")
else:
    raise ValueError(f"Unknown plan type: {current}")

# --- do other things below with backend, quantum circuit, sampler & transpilation ------
