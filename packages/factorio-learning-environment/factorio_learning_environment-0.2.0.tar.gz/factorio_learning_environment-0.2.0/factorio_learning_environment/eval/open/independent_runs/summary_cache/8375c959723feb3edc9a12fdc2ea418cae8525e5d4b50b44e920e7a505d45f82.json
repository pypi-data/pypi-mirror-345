{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) mining coal, with a drop position at a Wooden Chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5) storing mined coal.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (-20.0, -70.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Furnace at position (-18.0, -70.0) with warnings of no ingredients to smelt.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-20.5, -66.5) transferring items between belts and furnaces.\n- Chest at position (-16.5, -64.5) storing iron plates.\n- BeltGroup connecting the furnaces and chests with multiple belts, some of which are not working.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Storage\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) mining copper ore, with a drop position at a Wooden Chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-23.5, -69.5) storing mined copper ore.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) mining iron ore, with a drop position at a Wooden Chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-12.5, -54.5) storing mined iron ore.\n\n### Miscellaneous Structures\n- Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with warnings of no ingredients to smelt.\n- Burner Inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) waiting for source items, connected to chests at positions (1.5, 0.5) and (3.5, 0.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Non-Working Belts\n- Ensure all belts are correctly connected and powered. Check connections for belts at positions such as (-25.5, -70.5), (-24.5, -70.5), and others listed in the logs.\n\n### Errors with Furnaces Having No Ingredients\n- Ensure furnaces have a consistent supply of raw materials to smelt. Check the supply lines to the furnaces at positions (-18.0, -70.0) and (0.0, 0.0).\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that inserters have access to source items. Check the supply line to the burner inserter at position (2.5, 0.5).\n\n### Errors with Full Chests\n- Regularly check and empty chests to prevent production halts due to full inventories."}
