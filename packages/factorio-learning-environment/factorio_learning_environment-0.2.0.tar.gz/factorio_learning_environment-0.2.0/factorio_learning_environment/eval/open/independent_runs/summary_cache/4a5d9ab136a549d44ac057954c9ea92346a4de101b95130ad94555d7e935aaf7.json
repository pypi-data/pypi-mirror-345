{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position(41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 41.0, -82.0) which is currently working and extracting resources.\n- Wooden chest (position 41.5, -80.5) that is currently full and needs to be emptied to continue mining.\n\n### Stone Furnace at position(-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position -15.0, -50.0) which is currently working and processing iron ore into iron plates. It has a warning indicating that the furnace result inventory is full.\n\n### Wooden Chest at position(41.5, -80.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest (position 41.5, -80.5) which is currently holding coal and is full.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n- **Errors related to full inventories:**\n  - The wooden chest at position (41.5, -80.5) is full. To continue mining, ensure to regularly empty the chest to avoid interruptions in resource extraction.\n  - The stone furnace at position (-15.0, -50.0) has a full result inventory. Make sure to remove the produced items (iron plates) to allow the furnace to continue processing.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the current execution steps.\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `wood`: int\n  - `coal`: int\n  - `iron-ore`: int\n  - `iron-plate`: int\n  - `mining-drill-position`: Position (x=41.0, y=-82.0)\n  - `furnace-position`: Position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n  - `chest-position`: Position (x=41.5, y=-80.5)"}
