{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage at Position (x=53.0, y=-83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=53.0, y=-83.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=52.5, y=-84.5) for storing coal.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining at Position (x=-25.0, y=-64.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-25.0, y=-64.0) connected to a transport belt group starting at (x=-25.5, y=-65.5) and ending at (x=-23.5, y=-65.5).\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage at Position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-54.5) for storing iron ore.\n\n### Iron Plate Production at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with a Wooden Chest at position (x=1.5, y=0.5) for storing coal and iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=2.5, y=0.5) transferring items between chests at positions (x=1.5, y=0.5) and (x=3.5, y=0.5).\n\n### Belt System\nConsists of several belt groups:\n- Belt Group from (x=-26.5, y=-65.5) to (x=-22.5, y=-65.5) for transporting materials.\n- Belt Group from (x=-23.5, y=-64.5) to (x=-21.5, y=-64.5).\n- Belt Group from (x=-20.5, y=-64.5) to (x=-20.5, y=-66.5).\n- Belt Group from (x=-14.5, y=-63.5) to (x=-14.5, y=-65.5).\n- Belt Group from (x=-18.5, y=-63.5) to (x=-12.5, y=-58.5).\n- Belt Group from (x=-14.5, y=-54.5) to (x=-17.5, y=-59.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities without inventory\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to place an entity. For example, a transport belt could not be placed at (-22.5, -65.5) because it was not available in the inventory.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity in a tile before attempting placement. A transport belt could not be placed at (-21.5, -65.5) due to an existing object blocking the target location."}
