{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=0.5, y=28.0)\nConsists of:\n- Boiler at position (x=0.5, y=28.0)\n- Offshore pump at position (x=-3.5, y=27.5)\n- Steam engine at position (x=7.5, y=39.5)\n- Connected pipe groups facilitating water and steam transport\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at position (x=40.0, y=-84.0) connected to a wooden chest at position (x=40.5, y=-82.5)\n- Wooden chest at position (x=41.5, y=-83.5)\n- Burner inserter at position (x=54.5, y=-83.5) connected to a chest at position (x=56.5, y=-83.5)\n- Belt group transporting coal from position (x=50.5, y=-86.5) to (x=48.5, y=-86.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Storage\nConsists of:\n- Iron chest at position (x=0.5, y=0.5) containing iron plates\n- Additional iron chests at positions (x=1.5, y=0.5) and (x=2.5, y=0.5)\n\n### Laboratory\n- Lab with input for automation science pack, currently not powered\n\n### Copper Plate Production\n- Furnace at position (x=-15.0, y=-49.0) with a warning of no ingredients to smelt\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Using Extracting but Being Too Far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors with Full Output Inventory\n- Ensure that the output inventory, such as chests, has enough space to accommodate the items being produced or transferred. For example, the chest at position (x=40.5, y=-82.5) is full, preventing further mining.\n\n### Errors with Power Supply\n- Ensure that all power-consuming entities, such as labs, are connected to a functional power network to avoid no power status.\n\n### Errors with Fluid Connections\n- Verify that all fluid-related entities, such as boilers and steam engines, are properly connected to ensure the flow of necessary fluids like water and steam."}
