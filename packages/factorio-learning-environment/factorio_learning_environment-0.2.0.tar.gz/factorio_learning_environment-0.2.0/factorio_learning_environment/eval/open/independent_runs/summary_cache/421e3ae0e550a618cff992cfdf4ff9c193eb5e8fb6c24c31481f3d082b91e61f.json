{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\u2022 No new permanent structures have been successfully established during these steps. In several recovery updates the agent attempted to supply a Lab for Automation Science Packs by placing one at (0.5, 2.5), but all placement and crafting attempts failed due to missing inventory and sub-ingredient issues.\n\u2022 Processing operations made use of existing smelting facilities. Although not newly constructed, the agent interacted with two furnaces for resource processing:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Iron Smelting Furnace at Position(x=5.0, y=5.0) used to convert iron ore into iron plates.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Copper Smelting Furnace at Position(x=-27.0, y=-60.0) used to transform copper ore into copper plates.\nThese entities are referenced solely for their production role and do not constitute a multi-component structure assembled by the agent.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 API Usage Errors with get_entities\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Avoid using unsupported keywords (e.g. \u2018radius\u2019) or incorrect positional arguments. Verify the function\u2019s signature and call get_entities with only the accepted parameters.\n\u2022 Lab Placement and Inventory Validation\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Ensure that a Lab is available in the inventory before attempting placement. Checking inventory preconditions will help avoid \u201cNo lab in inventory\u201d errors.\n\u2022 Handling NoneType Returns in Entity Retrieval\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 When filtering results from get_entities, confirm that the return value is not None. Implement fallback logic (such as defaulting to an empty list) to prevent iteration over a None value.\n\u2022 Lab Crafting and Resource Chain Shortfalls\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Multiple lab crafting attempts failed due to missing sub-ingredients (e.g. iron-gear-wheel, electronic-circuit, copper-cable). Fully assess required intermediate items and ensure that the complete production chain (smelting resources and crafting components) is operational prior to lab crafting.\n\u2022 Consolidated Resource Management\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Persistent shortages in essential resources (iron-plates, copper-plates, and their derived products) have contributed to lab crafting failures. Review and balance resource production to meet the recipe prerequisites before initiating further lab production attempts."}
