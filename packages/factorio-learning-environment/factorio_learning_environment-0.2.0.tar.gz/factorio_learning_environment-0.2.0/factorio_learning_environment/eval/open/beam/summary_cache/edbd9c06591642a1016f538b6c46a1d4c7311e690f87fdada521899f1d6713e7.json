{"content": "The issue seems to be that the furnace is not receiving the necessary resources, and its inventory is empty. Let's address this step by step:\n\n1. **Verify Furnace Existence**: Ensure the furnace is correctly identified.\n2. **Check Global Inventory**: Make sure there are enough resources available to insert into the furnace.\n3. **Insert Resources**: Insert coal and copper ore into the furnace.\n4. **Allow Processing**: Give time for the furnace to process the materials.\n5. **Craft Items**: Use the processed materials to craft the necessary items.\n\nLet's go through these steps:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Verify the furnace entity\nfurnace = next((entity for entity in get_entities() if entity.name == \"stone-furnace\" and entity.position == Position(x=5.0, y=5.0)), None)\nassert furnace, \"Furnace not found at expected coordinates.\"\n\n# Step 2: Check global inventory for resources\nglobal_inventory = inspect_inventory()\navailable_coal = global_inventory.get(Prototype.Coal, 0)\navailable_copper_ore = global_inventory.get(Prototype.CopperOre, 0)\n\nprint(f\"Available Coal: {available_coal}, Available Copper Ore: {available_copper_ore}\")\n\n# Step 3: Insert resources into the furnace\nif available_coal > 0:\n    try:\n        insert_item(Prototype.Coal, furnace, quantity=min(10, available_coal))\n        print(\"Coal inserted into the furnace.\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Error inserting coal: {e}\")\n\nif available_copper_ore > 0:\n    try:\n        insert_item(Prototype.CopperOre, furnace, quantity=min(5, available_copper_ore))\n        print(\"Copper ore inserted into the furnace.\")\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Error inserting copper ore: {e}\")\n\n# Step 4: Allow time for processing\nsleep(10)\n\n# Step 5: Check the furnace inventory after processing\nfurnace_inventory_after_processing = inspect_inventory(furnace)\nprint(\"Furnace inventory after processing:\", furnace_inventory_after_processing)\n\n# Extract copper plates if available\ncopper_plates = furnace_inventory_after_processing.get(Prototype.CopperPlate, 0)\nif copper_plates > 0:\n    extract_item(Prototype.CopperPlate, furnace.position, copper_plates)\n    craft_item(Prototype.CopperCable)\n\n# Step 6: Attempt to craft the small electric pole\ncrafted_poles = craft_item(Prototype.SmallElectricPole)\nassert crafted_poles > 0, \"Failed to craft the small electric pole.\"\n\n# Step 7: Place the small electric pole\npole_position = Position(x=4.0, y=3.0)\ntry:\n    electric_pole = place_entity(Prototype.SmallElectricPole, Direction.UP, pole_position)\n    assert electric_pole, \"Failed to place the electric pole.\"\n    print(\"Electric pole placed successfully.\")\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"Error placing the electric pole: {e}\")\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- **Ensure Resource Availability**: Before attempting to insert items into the furnace, confirm that the resources are available in your global inventory.\n- **Check Inventory After Each Step**: After inserting resources, always check the furnace inventory to ensure the items were successfully added.\n- **Handle Exceptions**: Use try-except blocks to gracefully handle any errors that occur during resource insertion or crafting.", "summary_range": "[1-154]"}
