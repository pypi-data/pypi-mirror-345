{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, y=-50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, y=-50.0) extracting iron ore, fueled by coal.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-14.5, y=-48.5) and (-15.5, y=-48.5) for temporary storage of iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, y=-48.5) transferring iron ore from chests to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, y=-48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, y=-46.5) for storing excess iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-14.5, y=-47.5) moving iron ore from chests to the furnace.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-5.5, y=-48.5) containing 129 iron plates.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-6.5, y=-48.5) containing 1600 iron plates (full).\n\n### Secondary Iron Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-10.0, y=-48.0) for additional smelting of iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-8.5, y=-47.5) transferring items to the furnace.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-7.5, y=-47.5) for storing processed materials.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-6.5, y=-47.5) containing 465 iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Insufficient Inventory\n- Ensure you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities. For example, ensure coal is available before trying to insert it into a mining drill.\n\n### Inserter Errors\n- **Inserter Waiting for Source Items**: Ensure that the source entity has items available for the inserter to pick up.\n- **Inserter Waiting for Space in Destination**: Ensure that the destination entity has enough space to accommodate incoming items from the inserter.\n\n### Furnace Errors\n- **No Ingredients to Smelt**: Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients (e.g., iron ore) to process.\n- **Furnace Belt at Drop Position is Blocked**: Ensure that there is space available at the drop position for the inserter to place items.\n\n### Chest Full Warnings\n- Regularly check and clear out full chests to prevent bottlenecks in production and storage.\n\nBy addressing these errors and warnings, the efficiency of the production line can be significantly improved."}
