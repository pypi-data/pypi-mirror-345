{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0) fueled by coal, smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter 1** at position (1.5, 0.5), transferring iron plates from the furnace to a wooden chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (2.5, 0.5) storing iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter 2** at position (3.5, 0.5), extracting iron plates from the wooden chest and placing them onto a transport belt.\n- **Transport Belt Group** connecting positions from (3.5, 0.5) to (6.5, 0.5), moving iron plates along the line.\n- **Burner Inserter 3** at position (6.5, 0.5), transferring iron plates from the transport belt to an end wooden chest.\n- **End Wooden Chest** at position (7.5, 0.5) collecting iron plates from the transport belt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied tiles\n- Ensure there is no existing entity at the target position before placing a new entity. Consider adjusting the spacing, direction, or reference position to avoid conflicts.\n\n### Errors when connecting belts directly from a chest\n- Use an inserter to transfer items from a chest to a belt. Belts cannot be directly connected to chests.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient inventory items\n- Verify that you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to place or craft entities. Gather raw resources if required.\n\n### Errors when crafting items without required sub-ingredients\n- Ensure you have all necessary sub-ingredients before crafting an item. For example, wood must be gathered as it cannot be crafted.\n\nThese tips should help mitigate common errors encountered during the setup and operation of production lines and entity placements."}
