{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo new structures have been successfully placed on the map. All attempts to deploy a Lab (the intended structure for supplying Automation Science Packs) have failed due to inventory and resource shortages. While the agent accessed existing smelting facilities (an iron furnace at Position(x=5.0, y=5.0) and a copper furnace at Position(x=-27.0, y=-60.0)) for processing raw materials, no new building constructions have been completed.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 get_entities API misuse\n\u2003\u2013 Verify the function signature before calling. Avoid using unsupported keywords (such as \u201cradius\u201d) or supplying extra positional arguments.\n\u2003\u2013 Incorporate proper fallback handling when the call returns None to prevent iteration errors.\n\u2022 Lab placement and crafting failures\n\u2003\u2013 Confirm that a Lab is available in the inventory before attempting placement.\n\u2003\u2013 Check for resource sufficiency by ensuring all required sub-ingredients (e.g. iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, copper-cables) are available prior to initiating Lab crafting.\n\u2003\u2013 Validate that retrieved collections are not None before iterating over them.\n\n"}
