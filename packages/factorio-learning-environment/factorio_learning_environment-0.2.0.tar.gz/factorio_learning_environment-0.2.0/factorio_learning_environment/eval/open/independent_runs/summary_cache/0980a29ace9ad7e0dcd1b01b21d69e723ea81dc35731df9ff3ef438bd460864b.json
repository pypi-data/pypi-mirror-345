{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) for extracting iron ore.\n- Stone Furnaces at positions:\n  - (x=-13.0, y=-48.0)\n  - (x=-11.0, y=-48.0)\n  - (x=-9.0, y=-48.0)\n- Iron Chests for storage at positions:\n  - (x=-18.5, y=-48.5)\n  - (x=-16.5, y=-48.5)\n  - (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n  - (x=-15.5, y=-48.5)\n  - (x=-13.5, y=-49.5)\n  - (x=-9.5, y=-49.5)\n  - (x=-14.5, y=-47.5)\n- Wooden Chests at positions:\n  - (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n  - (x=-12.5, y=-49.5)\n  - (x=-9.5, y=-49.5)\n\n### Coal Storage and Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0) for coal extraction.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=43.0, y=-82.0).\n- Iron Chests for coal storage at positions:\n  - (x=41.5, y=-80.5)\n  - (x=42.5, y=-80.5)\n  - (x=44.5, y=-80.5)\n  - (x=45.5, y=-80.5)\n  - (x=47.5, y=-80.5)\n  - (x=49.5, y=-80.5)\n- Burner Inserters at positions:\n  - (x=43.5, y=-80.5) for transferring coal and iron plates.\n  - (x=41.5, y=-78.5) for transferring items to the wooden chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=41.5, y=-79.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when clearing furnace outputs\n- Ensure that the furnace is not full or blocked before attempting to clear outputs. Make sure there is space in the target inventory for extracted items.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors with inserters not working\n- Verify that the connected chest has the required items and that the inserter is properly fueled and positioned to transfer items."}
