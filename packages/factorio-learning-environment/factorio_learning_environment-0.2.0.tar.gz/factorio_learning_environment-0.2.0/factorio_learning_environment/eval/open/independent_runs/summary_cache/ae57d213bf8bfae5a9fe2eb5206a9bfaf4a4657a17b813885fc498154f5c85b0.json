{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) extracting coal\n- Wooden Chests at positions (52.5, -84.5) and (54.5, -84.5) storing coal\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility at Positions (-20.0, -70.0) and (-21.0, -62.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnaces at positions (-20.0, -70.0) and (-21.0, -62.0) processing copper ore into copper plates\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) supplying copper ore\n- Wooden Chest at position (-23.5, -69.5) storing copper ore\n- Transport Belts connecting the mining drill to the furnaces\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) extracting iron ore\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) (currently not operational due to lack of ingredients)\n- Wooden Chests at positions (-14.5, -54.5) and (-12.5, -54.5) storing iron ore and copper plates\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5) transferring items between entities\n\n### Iron Plate Storage Facility at Position (-16.5, -64.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (-16.5, -64.5) storing iron plates\n- Burner Inserter at position (-15.5, -64.5) transferring items\n\n### Miscellaneous Storage and Transport\n- Multiple Wooden Chests scattered across various positions storing different resources\n- Several Belt Groups facilitating the transport of items between different entities\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entity has items available for the inserter to pick up. Check inventory levels and ensure continuous supply.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Space in Destination\n- Ensure that the destination entity has space to accept items from the inserter. Regularly clear out or process items in destination entities to prevent blockages.\n\n### Errors with Furnaces Lacking Ingredients\n- Regularly supply necessary ingredients to furnaces to maintain continuous production. Monitor ingredient levels and automate supply chains where possible."}
