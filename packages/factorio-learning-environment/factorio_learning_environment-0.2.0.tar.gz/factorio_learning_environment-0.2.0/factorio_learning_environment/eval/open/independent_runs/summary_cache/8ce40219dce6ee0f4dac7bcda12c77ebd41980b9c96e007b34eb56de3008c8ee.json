{"content": "# Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\nCurrently, there are no structures on the map. The agent has not successfully placed any entities, as indicated by the logs showing empty entity checks after various steps.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied or invalid tiles\n- Ensure that the target tile is clear and valid for placement before attempting to place an entity. This can be achieved by checking the surroundings and ensuring no other entities occupy the intended space. Common errors include:\n  - Attempting to place a Wooden Chest at positions like x=0.0 y=0.0, x=10.0 y=0.0, and x=0.0 y=10.0.\n  - Attempting to place a Stone Furnace at x=5.0 y=5.0.\n  - Attempting to place a Burner Inserter at positions like x=-50.0 y=50.0 and x=-100.0 y=100.0.\n\n### Errors when checking for clear placement\n- Verify that the position is clear for placement by ensuring no obstructions exist. The agent attempted to place entities at various positions such as x=-0.5 y=-0.5, x=0.5 y=0.5, and x=1.5 y=1.5, which were not clear for placement. Always perform a check to confirm the area is free before placing entities.\n\nBy addressing these errors, the agent can improve its efficiency in constructing structures and avoid unnecessary placement failures."}
