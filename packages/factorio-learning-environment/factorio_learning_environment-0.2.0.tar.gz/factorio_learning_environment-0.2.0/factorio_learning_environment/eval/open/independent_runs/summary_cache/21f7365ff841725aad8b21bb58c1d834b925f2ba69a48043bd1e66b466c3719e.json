{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report: Steps 0-15\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Basic Power Generation at x=-5.0 y=2.5\n*   **Purpose:** Generates steam from water and burns coal to produce electricity.\n*   **Components:**\n    *   Offshore Pump at `Position(x=-9.5, y=-0.5)` extracting water.\n    *   Boiler at `Position(x=-5.0, y=2.5)` consuming coal (currently fueled) and heating water.\n    *   Steam Engine at `Position(x=-0.5, y=2.5)` consuming steam and generating power.\n    *   Pipe Group connecting Offshore Pump to Boiler (`fluid_system=6106`).\n    *   Pipe Group connecting Boiler to Steam Engine (`fluid_system=6109`).\n    *   Electric poles connecting the Steam Engine to the power grid (`ElectricityGroup id=72214`).\n\n### Iron Mining and Smelting at x=19.5 y=73.5\n*   **Purpose:** Mines Iron Ore, smelts it into Iron Plates, and stores them in a chest. It is powered and fueled.\n*   **Components:**\n    *   Electric Mining Drill at `Position(x=19.5, y=73.5)` placed over Iron Ore.\n    *   Stone Furnace at `Position(x=20.0, y=77.0)` for smelting (fueled with Coal).\n    *   Inserter at `Position(x="}
