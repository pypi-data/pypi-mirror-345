Check the inventory of the chest to confirm it contains items.\n\n### Errors with inserters waiting for source items\n- Ensure that the source entity (e.g., chest or belt) contains items that the inserter can pick up. Verify that the supply chain is not disrupted and that the source is adequately stocked.\n\n### Errors with mining drills due to full chests\n- Regularly check and empty chests at the drop positions of mining drills to prevent them from becoming full and halting production."}
