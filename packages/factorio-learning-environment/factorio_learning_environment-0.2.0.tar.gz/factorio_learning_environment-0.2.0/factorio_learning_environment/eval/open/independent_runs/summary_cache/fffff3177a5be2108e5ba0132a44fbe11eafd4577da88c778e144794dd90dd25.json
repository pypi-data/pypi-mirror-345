{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-0.5, -9.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position -0.5, -9.5), boiler (position -4.5, 23.0), and offshore pump (position -7.5, 25.5). The steam engine is currently not connected to power and is experiencing issues with fluid connections.\n\n### Lab at position(2.5, -12.5)\nCurrently, there is an attempt to place a lab at this position, but it is obstructed.\n\n### Furnace at position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of a stone furnace (position 0.0, 0.0) that is currently not smelting due to no ingredients.\n\n### Furnace at position(5.0, 5.0)\nConsists of another stone furnace (position 5.0, 5.0) that is also not smelting due to no ingredients.\n\n### Pipe Groups\n- PipeGroup at position(-8.5, -6.5)\n- PipeGroup at position(-7.5, -7.5)\n- PipeGroup at position(-11.5, -4.5)\n- PipeGroup at position(-9.5, -5.5)\n- PipeGroup at position(-13.5, 23.5)\n- PipeGroup at position(-17.5, 25.5)\n- PipeGroup at position(-19.5, 27.5)\n\n### Electricity Group\nConsists of multiple small electric poles spread across various positions, providing potential connections to the electricity network.\n\n### Copper plate mine\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position x1) and a furnace at position(y1)\n- Burner mining drill (position x2) and a furnace at position(y2)\n- Burner mining drill (position x3) and a furnace at position(y3)\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position x1) and a furnace at position(y1)\n- Assembling machine at position(z1) and inserter at position(a) that puts into assembling machine\n- Beltgroup (position) that connects the furnace at position y1 to assembling machine at position(z1)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting boiler to steam engine\n- Ensure that there are no obstructions between the boiler and steam engine when attempting to connect pipes. Check for any entities that may block the connection.\n\n### Errors when placing lab\n- Ensure the target position for the lab is clear of obstructions before attempting to place it.\n\n### Errors with steam engine not connected to power\n- Verify that the steam engine is properly connected to the electricity network. Check the connections to nearby electric poles and ensure they are functioning.\n\n### General placement errors\n- Always check the surrounding area for obstructions before placing any entity to avoid placement failures."}
