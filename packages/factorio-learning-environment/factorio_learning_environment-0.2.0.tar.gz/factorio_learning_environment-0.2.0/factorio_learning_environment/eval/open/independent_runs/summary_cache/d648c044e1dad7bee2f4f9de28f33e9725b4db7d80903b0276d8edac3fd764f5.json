{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Ore Mining and Storage Facility at Position (4.0, -60.0)\n- Consists of:\n  - Burner Mining Drill at Position (4.0, -60.0) with warnings about being out of fuel and a full chest at the drop position.\n  - Wooden Chest at Position (4.5, -58.5) containing iron ore.\n  - Wooden Chest at Position (5.5, -60.5) containing iron plates.\n\n#### Iron Plate Storage Area\n- Consists of multiple Wooden Chests at various positions:\n  - Position (-21.5, -54.5) containing iron plates.\n  - Position (-20.5, -54.5) containing iron plates.\n  - Position (-18.5, -54.5) containing iron plates.\n  - Position (-19.5, -54.5) containing iron plates.\n  - Position (-4.5, -52.5) containing iron plates with a warning that the chest is full.\n  - Position (-5.5, -52.5) containing iron ore.\n  - Position (-3.5, -52.5) containing iron plates.\n  - Position (-2.5, -52.5) containing iron ore.\n  - Position (-14.5, -50.5) empty.\n  - Position (-13.5, -50.5) empty.\n  - Position (-12.5, -50.5) empty.\n  - Position (-11.5, -50.5) containing iron plates.\n  - Position (-10.5, -50.5) empty.\n  - Position (-9.5, -50.5) containing iron plates.\n  - Position (-8.5, -50.5) containing iron plates.\n  - Position (-7.5, -50.5) containing iron plates.\n  - Position (-6.5, -50.5) containing iron plates.\n  - Position (-5.5, -50.5) containing iron plates.\n\n#### Iron Smelting Facility\n- Consists of:\n  - Stone Furnace at Position (-15.0, -48.0) with coal as fuel, containing iron plates, but with no ingredients to smelt.\n  - Stone Furnace at Position (-13.0, -48.0) with coal as fuel, containing iron plates, but with no ingredients to smelt.\n  - Stone Furnace at Position (-11.0, -48.0) with coal as fuel, containing iron plates, but with no ingredients to smelt.\n  - Wooden Chest at Position (-15.5, -49.5) containing iron plates with a warning that the chest is full.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Inventory Management Errors\n- Ensure there is enough space in the inventory before attempting to extract items from chests. This will prevent repeated errors of \"Not enough space in inventory to extract iron ore from chest at x=4.5 y=-58.5\".\n\n#### Fuel Management for Mining Drills\n- Regularly check and refuel mining drills to avoid warnings about being out of fuel.\n\n#### Chest Management\n- Regularly empty chests to prevent them from becoming full and halting production processes.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n#### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined by the agent in the provided logs.\n\n#### Important Variables\n- `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Represents the current inventory with item names as keys and their quantities as values. Current inventory includes items like 'wooden-chest', 'wood', 'coal', 'iron-ore', and 'iron-gear-wheel'."}
