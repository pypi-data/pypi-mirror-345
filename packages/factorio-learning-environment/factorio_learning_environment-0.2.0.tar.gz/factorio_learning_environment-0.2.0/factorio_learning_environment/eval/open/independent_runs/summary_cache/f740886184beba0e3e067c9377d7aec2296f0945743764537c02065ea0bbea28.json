{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (x=53.0, y=-83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=53.0, y=-83.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=52.5, y=-84.5) for coal extraction and storage.\n\n### Copper and Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-25.0, y=-64.0) connected to a transport belt system for copper and iron ore extraction.\n- Transport Belt Group connecting positions (x=-26.5, y=-65.5) to (x=-22.5, y=-65.5) for ore transportation.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-19.0, y=-65.0) for ore smelting, currently with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-17.5, y=-64.5) with a warning of output blocked, indicating a need for a sink entity.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage Facility at Position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-54.5) for iron ore extraction and storage.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) for iron plate production, currently with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=2.5, y=0.5) waiting for source items, connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=1.5, y=0.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Inventory Items\n- Ensure you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities. For example, attempting to insert coal without having any in your inventory will result in an error.\n\n### Errors with Inserters and Output Blockage\n- When using inserters, ensure that there is a destination entity available to receive the output. If the output is blocked, the inserter will not function properly.\n\n### Errors with Smelting Operations\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. If a furnace has no ingredients, it will not produce any output."}
