{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Setup at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nThis setup is designed to extract and process iron ore into iron plates. It consists of the following entities:\n\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0)\n  - Responsible for extracting iron ore from the ground.\n  - Currently has warnings: \"out of fuel\" and \"chest at drop position is full. Empty the chest at (-14.5, -48.5) to continue mining.\"\n  \n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5)\n  - Serves as a storage unit for the extracted iron ore.\n  - Currently contains 23 units of iron ore.\n\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5)\n  - Transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the stone furnace.\n  - Requires regular refueling with coal to operate.\n\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0)\n  - Used to smelt iron ore into iron plates.\n  - Currently has a warning: \"no ingredients to smelt,\" indicating it is not receiving iron ore from the inserter.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Alignment and Functionality\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items from the source (wooden chest) to the destination (stone furnace).\n- Regularly check and refuel the inserter with coal to maintain its operation.\n\n### Errors with Resource Management\n- Monitor the inventory of the wooden chest to prevent it from becoming full, which halts the mining drill operation.\n- Regularly extract iron ore from the chest to free up space and ensure continuous mining.\n\n### Errors with Fuel Management\n- Ensure that all fuel-dependent entities, such as the burner mining drill and inserter, are adequately refueled with coal to avoid operational interruptions.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Operation\n- Verify that the stone furnace is receiving the necessary ingredients (iron ore) to function. Adjust the inserter setup if the furnace is not receiving materials."}
