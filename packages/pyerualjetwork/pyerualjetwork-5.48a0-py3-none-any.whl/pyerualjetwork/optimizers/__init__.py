Optimizers
==============
PyereualJetwork is a large wide GPU-accelerated machine learning library in Python designed for professionals and researchers.
It features PLAN, MLP Deep Learning and PTNN training, as well as ENE (Eugenic NeuroEvolution) for genetic optimization, 
which can also be applied to genetic algorithms or Reinforcement Learning (RL) problems. 
The library includes functions for data pre-processing, visualizations, model saving and loading, prediction and evaluation, 
training, and both detailed and simplified memory management.
