{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) with a fuel inventory of coal. This drill is actively working and is connected to:\n  - **Wooden Chests** at positions (-14.5, -48.5) and (-15.5, -48.5) for storage.\n  - **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5) which transfers mined iron ore to the furnaces.\n- **Stone Furnaces**:\n  - Furnace at position (-12.0, -48.0) is working, fueled by coal, with iron ore and iron plate inventories.\n  - Furnace at position (-10.0, -48.0) is not working due to a lack of ingredients.\n- **Burner Inserters**:\n  - Inserter at position (-14.5, -47.5) is working, transferring items between chests and furnaces.\n  - Inserter at position (-11.5, -46.5) is waiting for source items.\n  - Inserter at position (-8.5, -47.5) is waiting for source items.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage\n- **Wooden Chests**:\n  - Positioned at (-7.5, -48.5), (-6.5, -48.5), (-6.5, -49.5), (-4.5, -48.5), (-5.5, -48.5), and (-3.5, -48.5) with varying quantities of iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Extracting Items\n- Ensure that the target entity or position has the items available for extraction before attempting to extract. This will prevent extraction errors.\n\n### Errors when Inserting Items\n- Verify that there is space available in the target entity for the items you wish to insert. This will avoid insertion errors.\n\n### Blockage at Inserter Drop Position\n- Regularly check and clear the drop positions of inserters to prevent blockages that can halt production.\n\n### Errors when Using Extracting but Being Too Far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when Placing into a Tile Which is Occupied by Another Entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
