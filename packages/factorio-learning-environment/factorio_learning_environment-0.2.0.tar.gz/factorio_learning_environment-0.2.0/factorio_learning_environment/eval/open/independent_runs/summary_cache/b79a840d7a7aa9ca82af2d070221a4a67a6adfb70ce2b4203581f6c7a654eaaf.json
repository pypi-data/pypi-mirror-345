{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Boiler at position (-5.5, 24.0) fueled with coal, working status.\n- Steam engine at position (-1.5, 24.5) connected to the boiler, working status.\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, 24.5) supplying water to the boiler, working status.\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine, ensuring fluid flow.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace at position (6.0, -62.0) fueled with coal, currently not smelting due to lack of ingredients.\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) transferring items between entities, working status.\n- Wooden chest at position (7.5, -61.5) and another at position (6.5, -59.5) for storing items.\n\n### Research Lab\n- Lab with input of automation science packs, currently not conducting research.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Insufficient Inventory\n- Ensure you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities. For example, coal was not available in the inventory when trying to insert it into the boiler.\n\n### Errors When Furnace Lacks Ingredients\n- Regularly check the stone furnace for required ingredients to maintain continuous production. Ensure that the necessary raw materials are available for processing."}
