# Instructlab Docs

The directory `instructlab/docs` serves two purposes:

1. To provide advanced user, and maintainer documentation.
2. A place for the infrastructure to autogenerate the (sphinx) docs website to live.

A preview of the site can be done locally by running `make docs` and opening up `docs/build/html/index.html1 in a web browser.
