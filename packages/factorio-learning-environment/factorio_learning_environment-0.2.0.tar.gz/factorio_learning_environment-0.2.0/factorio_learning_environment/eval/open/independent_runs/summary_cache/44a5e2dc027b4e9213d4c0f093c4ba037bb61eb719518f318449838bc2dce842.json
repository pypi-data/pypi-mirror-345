{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining Operation at (-24, -15)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (x=24.0, y=-15.0) mining coal\n- Wooden chest (x=23.5, y=-16.5) collecting coal output\n\n### Iron Mining Operation at (-14, 23)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (x=-14.0, y=23.0) mining iron ore\n- Wooden chest (x=-14.5, y=21.5) collecting iron ore output\n\n### Copper Processing Complex at (20-24, 20-22)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (x=20.0, y=20.0) mining copper ore\n- Complex inserter system:\n  - Central inserter (x=21.5, y=21.5) moving items between chests\n  - Input chest (x=20.5, y=21.5) collecting from miner\n  - Buffer chest (x=22.5, y=21.5) for copper ore\n  - Two support inserters (x=20.5, y=22.5 and x=22.5, y=22.5)\n  - Furnace input inserter (x=22.5, y=20.5)\n- Stone furnace (x=24.0, y=20.0) for smelting\n- Output system:\n  - Inserter (x=24.5, y=18.5) moving processed items\n  - Output chest (x=24.5, y=17.5) storing copper plates\n\n### Unused Furnace Group at (-11, 20)\nConsists of:\n- Two stone furnaces (x=-11.0, y=20.0 and x=-9.0, y=20.0) currently inactive\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Furnace Fuel Management\n- Check furnace fuel capacity before attempting to insert more coal\n- The furnace at (24, 20) is already at maximum fuel capacity (50/50)\n\n### Resource Management\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them\n- When attempting to insert coal, verify you have collected it from storage first\n\n### Structure Efficiency\n- Furnaces without ingredients are inefficient - ensure proper input supply\n- Multiple furnaces are idle with \"no ingredients to smelt\" warning - implement proper material flow"}
