{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n--------------------\nNo new structures have been successfully built on the map. Multiple recovery updates attempted to supply a Lab facility at (0.5, 2.5) for research support, but all placement and crafting attempts failed due to inventory shortages and unmet sub-ingredient dependencies. No other production structures have been created by the agent.\n\nERROR TIPS\n----------\n\u2022 API Usage \u2013 get_entities Issues\n  - When retrieving entities, use the correct function signature. Avoid passing unsupported keyword arguments (for example, do not use 'radius') and ensure the proper number of positional parameters is given.\n  \n\u2022 Lab Placement and Retrieval\n  - Verify that the Lab is present in the inventory before attempting placement. Prevent placement errors by checking both inventory and positional availability.\n  \n\u2022 Iteration over None\n  - Before iterating over a collection of entities (such as labs), confirm that the returned value is not None.\n  \n\u2022 Lab Crafting Dependencies\n  - Ensure that all sub-ingredients for Lab crafting (e.g. iron-gear-wheels and electronic-circuits) are available. Verify that prerequisite production steps\u2014such as smelting and intermediate crafting (copper-cable, copper-plate, and related components)\u2014have been successfully completed before reattempting Lab production."}
