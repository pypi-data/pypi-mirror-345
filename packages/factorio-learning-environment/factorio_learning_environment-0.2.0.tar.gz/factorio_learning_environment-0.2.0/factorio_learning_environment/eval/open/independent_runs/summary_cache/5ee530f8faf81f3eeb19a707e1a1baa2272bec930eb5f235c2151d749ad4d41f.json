{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Fuel: Coal (2 units)\n  - Neighbours: Wooden Chest, Burner Inserter\n  - Warnings: Chest at drop position is full. Empty the chest at (-14.5, -48.5) to continue mining.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Inventory: 11 units of Iron Ore\n  - Neighbours: Burner Mining Drill, Burner Inserter\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Status: Waiting for source items\n  - Fuel: Coal (5 units)\n  - Neighbours: Wooden Chest, Burner Mining Drill, Stone Furnace\n  - Pickup Position: (x=-12.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Drop Position: (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0)\n  - Status: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Fuel: Coal (1 unit)\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Neighbours: Burner Inserter\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities too far from the player\n- Ensure the player is within the maximum placement distance (10 units) from the target position. Move closer to the target area before attempting to place entities.\n\n### Errors when placing entities where there is a collision\n- Verify that the target position is clear of other entities and not on restricted terrain (e.g., water). Consider adjusting the spacing, direction, or reference position to avoid collisions.\n\n### Errors when the furnace is not receiving iron ore\n- Check the inserter setup to ensure it is correctly aligned and fueled to transfer items from the chest to the furnace. Ensure the inserter is properly positioned to pick up and drop items between entities."}
