{"content": "It appears that the variable `wooden_chest_inventory` was not defined in the current context due to the previous operations. Let's ensure we retrieve the **Wooden Chest** entity again, check its inventory, and then proceed with the extraction and smelting process.\n\n### Immediate Steps:\n1. Retrieve the **Wooden Chest** entity.\n2. Check its inventory for **Iron Ore**.\n3. Extract the **Iron Ore** into the primary inventory.\n4. Insert the **Iron Ore** into the **Stone Furnace** for smelting.\n\nLet's execute these steps now. \n\n```python\n# Step 1: Retrieve the Wooden Chest entity again to verify contents\nwooden_chest = get_entity(Prototype.WoodenChest, Position(x=-16.5, y=23.5))\n\n# Step 2: Inspect the inventory of the Wooden Chest\nif wooden_chest:\n    wooden_chest_inventory = inspect_inventory(wooden_chest)\n    print(f\"Wooden Chest Inventory: {wooden_chest_inventory}\")\n\n# Step 3: After verifying, if Iron Ore exists, transfer it into the inventory \nif wooden_chest_inventory.get(Prototype.IronOre, 0) > 0:\n    # Extract Iron Ore from the Wooden Chest into my inventory\n    extract_item(Prototype.IronOre, wooden_chest.position, quantity=1)  # Transfer 1 Iron Ore from the Wooden Chest\n\n# Step 4: Now insert the Iron Ore into the Stone Furnace for smelting\nif inspect_inventory().get(Prototype.IronOre, 0) > 0:\n    insert_item(Prototype.IronOre, furnace_entity, quantity=1)  # Insert available Iron Ore\n\n# Step 5: Wait again for the smelting process\nfor _ in range(30):  # Maximum wait for processing\n    iron_plates_produced = inspect_inventory(furnace_entity).get(Prototype.IronPlate, 0)\n    if iron_plates_produced > 2:  # Check if more than 2 Iron Plates have been produced\n        break\n    sleep(1)\nelse:\n    print(\"Iron smelting process timeout - check fuel and inputs again.\")\n\n# Step 6: Check the updated inventory after this process\nprint(f\"Inventory after attempting to smelt Iron Ore again: {inspect_inventory()}\")\nprint(f\"Entities on the map after smelting attempt: {get_entities()}\")  # Review status after the smelting attempt.\n``` \n\nThis code will ensure we correctly handle the Iron Ore extraction and smelting process. Let's execute this sequence.", "summary_range": "[1-250]"}
