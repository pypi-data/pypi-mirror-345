{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll generate a report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining Setup (around position 41, -82)\n- Burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0) mining coal\n- Connected to input iron chest at (41.5, -83.5)\n- Output wooden chest at (41.5, -80.5)\n- Additional storage iron chest at (41.5, -84.5)\n\n### Iron Smelting System (around position 46, -81)\n- Two stone furnaces at (45.0, -81.0) and (47.0, -81.0)\n- Input wooden chest with iron ore at (45.5, -79.5)\n- Two burner inserters at (45.5, -78.5) and (46.5, -78.5) feeding the furnaces\n- Output wooden chest at (49.5, -80.5) containing iron plates\n- Additional wooden chest at (45.5, -84.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Conflicts\n- Multiple failed attempts to place burner inserters at various positions around (45, -80)\n- Before placing entities, check if the target location is clear of other entities\n- Consider implementing a position validation check before attempting placement\n\n### Resource Management\n- Coal mining system has reached storage capacity with full chests\n- Implement a system to balance resource distribution or expand storage capacity\n- Monitor chest capacities and implement overflow prevention\n\n### Furnace Operation Issues\n- Both furnaces showing \"NO_INGREDIENTS\" status despite having fuel\n- Ensure proper inserter placement and orientation for material flow\n- Verify the complete production line connectivity from input to output\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nFunctions:\n- place_entity(): Places entities on the map, fails when position is occupied\n\nImportant Variables:\n- first_inserter: EntityRef (burner-inserter)\n- second_inserter: EntityRef (burner-inserter)\n\nSystem Status:\n- Iron ore chest inventory: 41 units\n- First furnace: No ingredients\n- Second furnace: No ingredients\n- Inserter positions verified and documented"}
