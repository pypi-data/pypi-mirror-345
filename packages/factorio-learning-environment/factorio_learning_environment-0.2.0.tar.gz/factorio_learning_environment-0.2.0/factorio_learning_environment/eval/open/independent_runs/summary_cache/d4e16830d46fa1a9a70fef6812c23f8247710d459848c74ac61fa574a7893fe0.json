{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) fueled with coal, extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) and (x=-15.5, y=-48.5) for storing extracted iron ore.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (x=-12.0, y=-48.0) and (x=-10.0, y=-48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserters**:\n  - At position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n  - At position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5) transferring iron ore between chests.\n  - At position (x=-8.5, y=-47.5) transferring iron plates from the furnace to the output chest.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (x=-7.5, y=-47.5) and (x=-6.5, y=-47.5) for storing iron plates.\n\n### Iron Ore Storage and Transfer System\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-46.5) storing iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-11.5, y=-45.5) for transferring items.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Space in Destination\n- Ensure the destination chest or entity has enough space to accommodate items being transferred by the inserter. Regularly monitor and clear the destination to prevent blockages.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Verify that the source entity or chest contains items for the inserter to pick up. Ensure continuous supply to maintain operational efficiency.\n\n### Furnace Output Full\n- Regularly transfer items from the furnace output to prevent production halts due to full output inventory. Consider adding more storage or increasing the frequency of item transfers.\n\n### Inserter Belt Blockage\n- Ensure that the drop position for inserters is clear and not blocked by other entities or items. Adjust the layout or increase the frequency of item removal to avoid blockages."}
