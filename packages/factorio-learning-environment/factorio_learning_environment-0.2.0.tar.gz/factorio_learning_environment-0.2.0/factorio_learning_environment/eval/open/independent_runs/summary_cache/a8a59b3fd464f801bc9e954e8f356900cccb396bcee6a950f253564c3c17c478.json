{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=1.5, y=23.0)\nThis structure is responsible for generating electricity and consists of the following entities:\n- **Steam Engine** at position (x=17.5, y=20.5), connected to a boiler and various pipes, actively working with energy of 15000.0.\n- **Boiler** at position (x=1.5, y=23.0), fueled with coal, actively working with energy of 2000.0, connected to pipes and steam output point at position (x=1.5, y=21.5).\n- **Offshore Pump** at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5), actively working, supplying water to the system through connected pipes.\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- **Steam Pipe Network**: A series of pipes transporting steam, starting from position (x=3.5, y=17.5) and extending through multiple positions to the steam engine.\n- **Water Pipe Network**: A series of pipes transporting water from the offshore pump, starting from position (x=-9.5, y=23.5) and extending through multiple positions to the boiler.\n\n### Electricity Distribution Network\n- **Electricity Poles**: Positioned at various coordinates including (x=10.5, y=17.5), (x=26.5, y=17.5), (x=30.5, y=17.5), and others, forming a network to distribute electricity generated by the steam engine.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using stale entity data\n- Ensure that the entity data is refreshed or updated before performing operations that depend on the current state of entities on the map. Stale data can lead to incorrect assumptions about the game state.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions**: None defined in the current steps.\n- **Variables**: None explicitly assigned or mentioned in the current steps."}
