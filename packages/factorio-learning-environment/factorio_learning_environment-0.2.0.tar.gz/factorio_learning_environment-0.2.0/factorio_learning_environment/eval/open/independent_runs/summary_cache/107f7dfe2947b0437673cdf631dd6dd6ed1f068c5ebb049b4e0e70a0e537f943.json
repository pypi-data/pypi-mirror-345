{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) with a drop position at (-14.5, -48.5), currently working and fueled with coal. It extracts iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -48.0), fueled with coal, which smelts iron ore into iron plates. It currently holds 100 iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-14.5, -46.5), fueled with coal, which transfers iron ore from the mining drill to the furnace.\n\n### Additional Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0), fueled with coal, but currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Misalignment Errors with Inserters\n- Ensure that the inserter's pickup position aligns with the mining drill's drop position to avoid misalignment errors. Reposition the inserter if necessary.\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities on Occupied Tiles\n- Before placing an entity, confirm that the target tile is unoccupied to avoid placement errors. Adjust the spacing, direction, or reference position as needed.\n\n### Output Blockage Warnings\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity in place to accept the output from the mining drill to prevent blockage. Clear any items blocking the output path.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Verify that the source entity has items available for the inserter to pick up to prevent it from waiting for source items."}
