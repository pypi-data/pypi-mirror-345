{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll generate a comprehensive report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing System (around position x=41-45, y=-80 to -84)\nComplex automated coal mining and storage setup consisting of:\n- Burner mining drill (x=41.0, y=-82.0) mining coal\n- Storage system with multiple chests:\n  - Two iron chests (x=41.5, y=-84.5 and x=41.5, y=-83.5) each storing 1600 coal\n  - Wooden chest (x=41.5, y=-80.5) acting as buffer storage\n- Transport system:\n  - Chest inserter (x=42.5, y=-80.5) moving coal from wooden chest to belt\n  - Transport belt (x=43.5, y=-80.5) moving right\n  - Furnace inserter (x=43.5, y=-81.5) for fuel insertion\n- Processing units:\n  - Stone furnace (x=45.0, y=-81.0) with fuel storage\n  - Additional stone furnace (x=47.0, y=-81.0) with fuel storage\n- Output storage:\n  - Wooden chest (x=49.5, y=-80.5) containing 1500 iron plates\n\n### Belt Transport System\n- Belt group running from y=-68.5 to y=-77.5 at x=42.5\n- Additional belt at x=43.5, y=-80.5 moving right\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Conflicts\n- Verify target location is clear before placing entities\n- Check for overlapping entity footprints when placing larger structures\n- Consider using different positions if initial placement fails\n\n### Transport System Issues\n- Belt blocking issues detected - ensure belts have space to move items\n- Monitor chest fullness to prevent backup in the transport chain\n- Ensure inserter pickup and drop positions are correctly aligned with the intended source and destination\n\n### Furnace Operation Issues\n- Furnaces showing \"no ingredients\" status - verify input logistics\n- Check fuel delivery system is properly configured\n- Ensure inserters are correctly oriented for both fuel and material input\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nFunctions:\n- place_entity(): Places entities in the world, requires clear space at target location\n\nImportant Variables:\n- furnace_inserter: BurnerInserter type, used for fuel insertion\n- Mining drill fuel: Inventory type containing coal\n- Chest inventory: Inventory type containing resources\n- Belt inventory: Inventory type tracking items on belts\n- Furnace fuel: Inventory type tracking furnace fuel levels"}
