{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-12.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-12.0, -48.0) with coal as fuel and currently producing iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -48.5) transferring iron ore from a chest to the furnace.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) storing iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-15.5, -48.5) storing additional resources.\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) extracting resources and transferring them to the chest.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-10.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-10.0, -48.0) with coal as fuel and currently producing iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-8.5, -47.5) transferring resources from a chest to the furnace.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-7.5, -47.5) storing resources.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items into a full inventory\n- Ensure that the target inventory (e.g., furnace) has enough space before attempting to insert items. If the inventory is full, extract some items or use them elsewhere to free up space.\n\n### Errors when inserting items without sufficient inventory\n- Make sure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. Regularly check your inventory to ensure you have the necessary resources.\n\n### Errors when inserters are waiting for source items\n- Verify that the source entity (e.g., chest or mining drill) has items available for the inserter to transfer. If not, ensure the source entity is properly supplied or operational."}
