{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo new structures have been successfully established on the map. Although the agent repeatedly attempted to create a Lab at position (0.5, 2.5) for supplying Automation Science Packs to ongoing research, all placement and crafting attempts failed. Other facilities (for example, the furnace at Position(x=5.0, y=5.0) and the copper furnace at Position(x=-27.0, y=-60.0)) were used for resource smelting but were not created as new map structures.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 API Usage for Entity Retrieval\n  \u2013 Avoid supplying unexpected keyword arguments (e.g. \u201cradius\u201d) or excess positional arguments when calling get_entities. Verify and adhere to its required signature before invocation.\n  \n\u2022 Lab Placement and Inventory Validation\n  \u2013 Prior to attempting to place a Lab, ensure that the lab item exists in the inventory to avoid placement failures.\n  \n\u2022 Handling Null Returns from Entity Queries\n  \u2013 When retrieving entities (such as labs), confirm that the returned value is a valid list rather than None to prevent iteration errors.\n  \n\u2022 Lab Crafting and Missing Ingredients\n  \u2013 Confirm that the production chain for intermediary items (iron-gear-wheel, electronic-circuit, and copper-cable) is operational and that sufficient base resources (iron-plate, copper-plate) are available before attempting Lab crafting.\n  \u2013 Address recurrent shortages (for instance, missing iron-gear-wheel quantities or insufficient copper-cable components) by proactively boosting production (via smelting or resource gathering) prior to reattempting crafting."}
