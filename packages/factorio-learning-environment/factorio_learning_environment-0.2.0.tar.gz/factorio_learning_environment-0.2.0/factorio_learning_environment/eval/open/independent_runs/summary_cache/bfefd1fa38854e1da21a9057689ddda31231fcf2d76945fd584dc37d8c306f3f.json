{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 19.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (-5.5, 19.5)\n- Boiler at position (-2.5, 24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe-group connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and the boiler to the steam engine, with segments at positions (-4.5, 16.5) and (-9.5, 23.5)\n- Electricity-group at position (-6.5, 20.785714285714285), currently not plugged into the electric network\n\n### Stone Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0), currently with no ingredients\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Entities with Pipes\n- Ensure that the entities you are trying to connect with pipes are correctly aligned and within the connection range. Double-check the positions and ensure there are no obstructions.\n\n### Errors Due to Inventory Shortages\n- Always verify that you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to place or insert them. For example, ensure you have coal before trying to insert it into the boiler.\n\n### Errors with Electric Network Connections\n- Make sure that all electric poles and entities are correctly connected to form a complete electric network. Check the positions and ensure that small electric poles are placed within the connection range of each other and the electricity group.\n\n### Errors with Index Out of Range\n- When accessing lists or arrays, ensure that the index you are trying to access exists. This can be avoided by checking the length of the list or using try-except blocks to handle potential errors.\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities\n- Verify that the tile where you want to place an entity is unoccupied and that the entity is available in your inventory."}
