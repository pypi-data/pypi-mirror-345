{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-59.5, -111.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (-59.5, -111.5)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-47.5, -123.5)\n- Multiple PipeGroups connecting the offshore pump to the steam engine, with positions ranging from (-52.5, -122.5) to (-48.5, -111.5)\n- Small Electric Poles at positions (-61.5, -111.5), (-61.5, -110.5), (-57.5, -111.5), (-57.5, -110.5)\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -76.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-15.5, -77.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -73.0) with coal as fuel\n- Stone Furnace at position (9.0, -64.0) with coal as fuel\n- Stone Furnace at position (6.0, -62.0) with coal as fuel\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (6.5, -59.5) and a Stone Furnace at position (6.0, -62.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (7.5, -61.5)\n\n### Research Lab\n- Lab with input of automation science packs, located at an unspecified position but connected to the electricity network\n\n### Electricity Network\n- Multiple Small Electric Poles forming a network, with positions ranging from (-52.5, -119.5) to (11.5, -65.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors When Placing Boiler\n- Ensure the target location for placing a boiler is clear of any existing objects. Check the area before attempting to place the boiler to avoid obstruction errors.\n\n### Errors Related to Power Connectivity\n- Connect all entities requiring electricity to the power network. Ensure that all inserters, labs, and other electrical entities are within the range of electric poles and that the poles are connected to a power source.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Fuel\n- Regularly check the fuel levels of burner mining drills and stone furnaces to ensure continuous operation. Refill them as necessary to avoid interruptions in mining and smelting processes.\n\n### Errors Due to Full Inventory\n- Monitor the inventory of chests connected to mining drills. Empty them periodically to prevent mining operations from halting due to full inventory."}
