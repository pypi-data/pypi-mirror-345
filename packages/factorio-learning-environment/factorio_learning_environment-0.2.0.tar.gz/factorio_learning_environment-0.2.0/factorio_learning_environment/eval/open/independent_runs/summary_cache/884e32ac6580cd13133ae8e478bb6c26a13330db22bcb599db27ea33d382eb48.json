{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mine and Smelter at position (16.0, 71.0)\nConsists of the following entities\n- Burner Mining Drill (position: 16.0, 71.0)\n- Wooden Chest (position: 16.5, 72.5)\n- Stone Furnace (position: 18.0, 73.0)\n- Burner Inserter (position: 15.5, 72.5) that moves iron ore from the chest to the furnace\n- Burner Inserter (position: 18.5, 74.5) that fuels the furnace with coal\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n* Errors when placing entities too far away or with incorrect spacing\n  - Make sure to move to the target position before placing an entity. The maximum distance for placing entities is 10 units. Check for existing entities that might be blocking the placement and adjust the spacing or direction accordingly.\n* Errors when inserting items into an entity\n  - Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into an entity.\n* Errors due to undefined variables\n  - Ensure all variables are defined before using them in your code. Check for typos and ensure that the variable is within the scope of the current execution context.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\nNo user-defined functions were found in the provided execution logs.\n\nImportant variables that have been assigned:\n- `drill`: Burner Mining Drill entity (type not explicitly annotated)\n- `chest`: Wooden Chest entity (type not explicitly annotated)\n- `furnace`: Stone Furnace entity (type not explicitly annotated)"}
