This network manages the input and output of smelting operations.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Automation Setup\nConsists of a burner\u2011mining drill located at (\u201315.0, \u201350.0) paired with a nearby wooden chest at (\u201313.5, \u201351.5). This setup is integrated into a transport\u2011belt network that efficiently distributes the mined ore.\n\n### Steam Power Generation System\nCentered on a boiler at (8.0, 20.5) equipped with connection points at approximately (8.5, 18.5) and (8.5, 22.5), this system powers multiple steam engines placed at (0.5, 9.5), (18.5, 11.5), (1.5, 13.5), (13.5, 14.5), (19.5, 14.5), (22.5, 18.5), (17.5, 20.5), (12.5, 21.5) and (4.5, 23.5). Note that an additional steam engine intended for this network remains unplaceable because of severe congestion and obstructions in the boiler zone.\n\n### Automation Research Lab\nFeatures a laboratory configured for automation science pack research. The lab is currently experiencing unstable power connectivity, affecting its operation.\n\n### Electrical, Transport, and Fluid Infrastructure\nAn integrated backbone comprised of electrical poles (organized into electricity groups), numerous belt groups, and various pipe groups. These interconnected systems manage the coordinated flow of power, materials, and fluids across the map.\n\n### Offshore Pump and Fluid Network\nConsists of an offshore pump positioned at (0.5, 30.5) that feeds water into the fluid system via a network of connected pipe groups.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 Persistent Extra Steam Engine Placement Issue  \n  \u2013 The extra steam engine remains unplaceable due to severe congestion around the boiler area. Overlapping burner\u2011inserters and misaligned transport belts are obstructing the designated buildable zone (near approximately (8.5, 22.5)).  \n  \u2013 Recommendation: Conduct a thorough manual inspection of the entire boiler zone and its connection interfaces, then remove or reposition interfering entities. Alternatively, consider relocating the extra steam engine to a less congested area or modifying the boiler layout to ensure adequate clearance.\n\n\u2022 Fuel Supply Shortages in Burner\u2011Powered Entities  \n  \u2013 Several burner\u2011inserters and the burner\u2011mining drill are repeatedly flagged as \u201cout of fuel\u201d or \u201cwaiting for source items,\u201d which can disrupt continuous operation.  \n  \u2013 Recommendation: Ensure that fuel sources are placed immediately adjacent to these burner\u2011powered machines and verify that the transport\u2011belt routing efficiently delivers fuel to all required stations.\n\n\u2022 Steam Engine Connectivity and Fluid Input Issues  \n  \u2013 Multiple steam engines report issues such as \u201cnot connected to power network\u201d and \u201cno input liquid,\u201d compromising the overall performance of the power generation system.  \n  \u2013 Recommendation: Review the electrical wiring and fluid piping arrangements. Reconfigure connection points and clear any obstructions to secure reliable network and fluid supplies for each steam engine.\n\n\u2022 Laboratory Power Instability  \n  \u2013 The Automation Research Lab continues to experience unstable power connectivity, affecting its research capabilities.  \n  \u2013 Recommendation: Reassess the placement and wiring of nearby electrical poles and related power infrastructure to stabilize the lab\u2019s power supply."}
