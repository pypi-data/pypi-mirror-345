{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nNo structures have been successfully created on the map. All attempts to place entities such as the Wooden Chest, Burner Mining Drill, and Stone Furnace have failed, resulting in no entities being present on the map.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure the target position is valid and unoccupied before attempting to place an entity. Multiple attempts to place a Wooden Chest, Burner Mining Drill, and Stone Furnace failed because the positions were either invalid or occupied.\n\n### Errors with incorrect API usage\n- When using the `get_entities` function, ensure that the second argument is a valid Position object. An error occurred due to incorrect argument type.\n- When creating a BuildingBox, ensure that the dimensions are correctly specified, as an error occurred with the Wooden Chest dimensions.\n- Avoid using non-callable objects as functions. An error was encountered when trying to use a 'Position' object as if it were callable.\n\n### General placement errors\n- Verify that the area is buildable before attempting to place entities. Errors occurred due to failure in finding a buildable area or placing an entity.\n\nThese tips should help mitigate the errors encountered and assist in successfully placing entities on the map."}
