{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and drops it into the adjacent chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates but currently not receiving iron ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Misalignment and Fueling Issues\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly aligned and positioned to transfer materials from the chest to the furnace. Repeated checks and repositioning indicate persistent misalignment.\n- Regularly refuel inserters and mining drills with coal to maintain operational status. Ensure sufficient coal supply in the inventory to avoid interruptions.\n\n### Chest Management\n- Monitor the chest's capacity to prevent it from becoming full, which halts the mining drill's operation. Regularly extract iron ore to free up space.\n- Keep track of the chest's inventory to ensure a steady supply of iron ore for the furnace.\n\n### Furnace Operation\n- Verify that the furnace is receiving the necessary iron ore from the inserter. Address any warnings about \"no ingredients to smelt\" by ensuring the inserter is functioning correctly and the chest has sufficient iron ore."}
