# `preswald deploy`

The `preswald deploy` command deploys your application to a desired environment, such as Structured Cloud, Google Cloud Platform, or a local container. It streamlines the deployment process, handling configuration and execution seamlessly.

Note: `preswald deploy` creates a `.env.structured` in the current directory for Structured Cloud deployments that is useful for `preswald stop` and `preswald deployments`.

## Options

- **`--target`**: Specifies the deployment target. Options include:
  - `structured`: Deploys to Structured Cloud. Requires Structured API Key.
  - `gcp`: Deploys to Google Cloud Platform. Requires GCloud CLI installed.
  - `local` (default): Builds and runs a container locally without deploying to the cloud.
- **`port` (int):**  
  The port on which to run the Preswald server. Default is 8501
- **`log-level` (str):**  
  The log level for the Preswald server. Options are DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL. Default is INFO
- **`github` (str):**  
  Github username (what you used to create your structured account with).
- **`api-key` (str):**  
  Structured API Key. See app.preswald.com for account and org details.

## Requirements for Cloud Deployment

- **Structured Cloud Deployment:**  
  Get an API key from Settings at https://app.preswald.com. The CLI will provide guidance on setup.
- **Google Cloud Deployment:**  
  Install the [GCloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install). If not, the CLI will provide guidance on setup.

## Example Deployment Commands

### 1. **Structured Cloud  Deployment**

To deploy your app to Structured Cloud:

```bash
preswald deploy --target structured --github <github-username> --api-key <structured-api-key> hello.py
```

This command packages your app into a container and deploys it to Structured Cloud, providing a shareable live preview link.

---

### 2. **Google Cloud Run Deployment**

To deploy your app to Google Cloud Run:

```bash
preswald deploy --target gcp
```

This command packages your app into a container and deploys it to Google Cloud Run, providing a shareable live preview link.

---

### 3. **AWS Deployment** (Coming soon!)

To deploy your app to AWS:

```bash
preswald deploy --target aws
```

Install and configure AWS CLI before running this command.

---

### 4. **Local Deployment (Dry Run)**

To build and test your app locally without deploying it to the cloud:

```bash
preswald deploy --target local
```

This creates a container locally for testing purposes.

---

### 5. **Default Deployment**

If no `--target` is specified, the deployment defaults to local execution:

```bash
preswald deploy
```

This builds and runs your app in a local container.

## What Preswald Handles

- **Cloud deployment:** Automates the process of containerizing your app, configuring the environment, and deploying it to the target platform.
- **Local testing:** Builds a container locally to let you verify your app before cloud deployment.
- **Live preview:** Provides a shareable URL (for cloud deployments) so others can interact with your app.

---

With `preswald deploy`, you can transition from local testing to cloud deployment in a few simple steps, making your app accessible to a broader audience.
