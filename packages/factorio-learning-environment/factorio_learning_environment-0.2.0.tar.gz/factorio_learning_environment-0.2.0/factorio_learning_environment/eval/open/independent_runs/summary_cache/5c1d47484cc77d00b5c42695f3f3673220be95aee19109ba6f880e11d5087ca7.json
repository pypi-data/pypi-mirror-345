{"content": "# Factorio Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electric pole at position (3.9, 3.1)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Electric pole (position (3.9, 3.1))\n\n### Steam engine at position (unknown)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam engine (position not specified)\n\n### Furnace at position (1.0, 1.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position (1.0, 1.0))\n\n### Wooden chest at position (3.5, 1.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest (position (3.5, 1.5))\n\n### Lab at position (unknown)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab (position not specified)\n\n### Offshore pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore pump (position (-9.5, 24.5))\n\n### Additional wooden chests\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest (position (3.5, 3.5))\n- Wooden chest (position (3.5, 5.5))\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to electric pole attributes\n- Ensure that the attributes accessed on the `ElectricityGroup` object are valid and exist. The errors indicate that `energy` and `connection_points` attributes do not exist for the `ElectricityGroup` object. Review the documentation to confirm the correct attributes to use.\n\n### Errors when finding nearest steam engine\n- Ensure that there is at least one steam engine placed on the surface before attempting to find the nearest one.\n\n### Errors related to building box dimensions\n- Ensure that the width and height attributes for the `BuildingBox` are correctly accessed as integers. Review the prototype attributes to ensure they are being accessed correctly.\n\n### Errors when using int() on non-numeric types\n- Ensure that the values being passed to the `int()` function are of the correct type (string, bytes-like object, or real number). Check the data types before conversion to avoid TypeErrors.\n\n### Errors when accessing private attributes\n- Ensure that you are accessing attributes correctly. The error indicates that you may be trying to access a private attribute. Review the prototype documentation for correct access methods.\n\n### Errors related to steam engine placement\n- Ensure that the target location for placing the steam engine is valid and not obstructed by other entities or terrain types (e.g., water). Check the surrounding area before attempting to place the steam engine.\n\n### Errors related to undefined names\n- Ensure that all necessary names and variables are defined in the current scope before usage. Review the code for any missing definitions or imports, particularly for built-in functions or variables."}
