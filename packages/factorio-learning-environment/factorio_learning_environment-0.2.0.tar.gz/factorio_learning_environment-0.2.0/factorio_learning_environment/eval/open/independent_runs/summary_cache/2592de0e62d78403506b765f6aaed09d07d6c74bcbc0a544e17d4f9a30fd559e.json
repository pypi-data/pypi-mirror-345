{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll generate a comprehensive report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining Setup at (41.0, -82.0)\nComplex automated coal mining system consisting of:\n- Burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0)\n- Wooden chest at (41.5, -80.5) for coal storage\n- Two burner inserters:\n  - Fuel inserter at (42.5, -81.5) taking from belt to feed drill\n  - Output inserter at (42.5, -80.5) taking coal from chest to belt\n- Belt system starting at (43.5, -80.5) flowing right\n\n### Iron Smelting Setup at (-15.0, -50.0)\nBasic smelting operation with:\n- Stone furnace at (-15.0, -50.0)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Belt Connection Errors\n- Cannot connect belts directly to wooden chests - must use inserters as intermediaries\n- When creating belt systems, ensure the path is clear of existing entities\n\n### Entity Placement Errors\n- Check for existing entities before placing new ones - multiple attempts to place inserters failed due to occupied spaces\n- When placing inserters, ensure the target location is completely clear\n\n### Belt System Issues\n- Belt systems getting blocked - implement proper clearing mechanisms before rebuilding\n- Ensure proper connection between belt segments when creating new systems\n\n### Resource Management\n- Monitor chest contents to prevent overfilling\n- Keep track of fuel levels in all burner entities\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nFunctions:\n- connect_entities(): Connects entities with transport belts\n- place_entity(): Places new entities on the map\n- extract_item(): Extracts items from entities\n- clear_belt_system(): Clears blocked belt systems\n\nImportant Variables:\n- drill_status: EntityStatus\n- inserter_status: EntityStatus\n- chest_contents: Dictionary[str, int]\n- furnace_contents: Dictionary[str, Dictionary[str, int]]\n\nThe agent has implemented a complex automated mining system but struggles with entity placement and belt connections. The main issues revolve around spatial planning and proper connection of transport systems."}
