{"content": "The repeated error message indicating that `random` is not defined suggests that the import statement for the `random` module is not being recognized by the environment. This is unusual, especially since the import statement is correctly placed at the top of the script.\n\nHere are a few steps to troubleshoot and resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Ensure the Import is at the Very Top**: Double-check that the `import random` statement is indeed at the very top of your script, before any other code.\n\n2. **Environment Check**: Verify that the execution environment supports the `random` module. Some restricted environments might not allow certain imports.\n\n3. **Syntax and Indentation**: Ensure there are no syntax errors or indentation issues before the import statement that might cause it to be skipped.\n\n4. **Reinitialize the Environment**: If possible, try restarting or reinitializing the environment to clear any potential state issues.\n\n5. **Minimal Test**: Run a minimal test script to check if the `random` module can be imported and used:\n   ```python\n   import random\n   print(random.uniform(-10, 10))\n   ```\n\n6. **Alternative Random Generation**: If the issue persists, consider using a different method for generating random numbers, such as using a predefined list of positions or a custom random function if the environment allows.\n\nHere is the script again with the import statement emphasized:\n\n```python\n# Import the random module at the start of the script\nimport random\n\ndef ensure_entity_placement(prototype, position=None):\n    \"\"\"Ensure that a given entity is placed.
