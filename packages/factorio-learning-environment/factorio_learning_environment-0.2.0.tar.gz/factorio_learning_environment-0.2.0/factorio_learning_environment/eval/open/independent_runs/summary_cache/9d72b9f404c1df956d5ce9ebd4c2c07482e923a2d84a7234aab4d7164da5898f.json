{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Consists of a stone furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) which is currently fueled by coal and has produced iron plates.\n- The furnace has warnings indicating \"no ingredients to smelt\" and \"furnace fuel source is full.\"\n\n### Pipe Network at Position (-12.5, 21.5)\n- Consists of a series of connected pipes forming a PipeGroup with fluid system ID 9827.\n- Pipe positions include: (x=-12.5, y=21.5), (x=-11.5, y=21.5), (x=-11.5, y=22.5), (x=-10.5, y=22.5), (x=-10.5, y=23.5), (x=-9.5, y=23.5).\n- The status of the pipe network is currently empty.\n\n### Electricity Network\n- Consists of an ElectricityGroup with poles positioned at various coordinates, including (x=-7.5, y=17.5), (x=-8.5, y=16.5), (x=-6.5, y=16.5), and others extending to (x=-0.5, y=22.5).\n- The network is currently without voltage.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Offshore Pump\n- Ensure that the position for placing an offshore pump is suitable and adjacent to a water source. Multiple attempts to place the pump were unsuccessful due to unsuitable positions.\n\n### Errors when Placing Boiler\n- Before attempting to place a boiler, verify that the intended position is suitable for placement. Attempts to place the boiler at positions like (x=-12.5, y=25.5) and (x=-12.5, y=25.0) were unsuccessful due to unsuitability.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Operations\n- Ensure that the furnace has the necessary ingredients to smelt and that the fuel source is not full to avoid warnings and inefficiencies in production."}
