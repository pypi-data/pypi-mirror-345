{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) fueled with coal, extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-15.5, y=-51.5) storing extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-51.5) transferring iron ore from the chest to the transport belt.\n- **Transport Belt Group** connecting the mining drill output to the furnace input, with belts running from (x=-13.5, y=-51.5) to (x=-11.5, y=-51.5) and from (x=0.5, y=-3.5) to (x=0.5, y=-1.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) fueled with coal, processing iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=0.5, y=-1.5) transferring iron plates from the furnace to the output belt.\n- **Transport Belt Group** facilitating the movement of materials between the furnace and other entities.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors when inserting items without available inventory\n- Ensure that the required items are present in the inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. For example, the error \"Could not insert: No coal to insert from your inventory\" indicates an attempt to insert coal when none was available.\n\n### Errors related to full storage entities\n- Regularly monitor and empty storage entities such as chests to prevent them from becoming full, which can halt production processes. For instance, the warning \"chest at drop position is full. Empty the chest at (-15.5, -51.5) to continue mining\" suggests that the mining process is stopped due to a full chest.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- **Function Definitions:**\n  - `insert_item(item: Prototype, target: Entity, quantity: int) -> None`: Attempts to insert a specified quantity of an item into a target entity.\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `mining_drill`: Represents the mining drill entity, used in the context of inserting items.\n  - `furnace`: Represents the furnace entity, used for processing iron ore into iron plates.\n  - `inventory`: A dictionary tracking the quantities of various resources available to the agent."}
