{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n###Iron Plate Production Area at position(-11.5, 19.5)\nConsists of two stone furnaces for smelting iron ore into iron plates:\n- First stone furnace at position(-11.0, 20.0)\n- Second stone furnace at position(-9.0, 20.0)\nBoth furnaces are operational and processing iron ore into iron plates, positioned near the iron ore source.\n\nERROR TIPS\n### Errors when attempting to craft items requiring assembly machines\n- Iron gear wheels cannot be crafted by hand as they require assembly machines\n- Before attempting to craft items like iron gear wheels, ensure you:\n  1. Have the required assembly machine built\n  2. Have the necessary raw materials (iron plates) available\n  3. Use the assembly machine for crafting instead of trying to craft manually\n\n### Errors when placing entities without having them in inventory\n- Verify that you have the required entity in your inventory before attempting to place it\n- Craft or obtain the entity first before trying to place it\n\n### Errors when crafting technology-locked items\n- Assembling machines require the \"Automation\" technology to be researched before they can be crafted\n- Check technology prerequisites before attempting to craft advanced items\n- Research required technologies first, then proceed with crafting"}
