{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (43.0, -82.0)\n- Burner Inserter at position (40.5, -80.5) and (42.5, -80.5)\n- Iron Chest at position (41.5, -80.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -79.5)\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0)\n- Stone Furnaces at positions (-13.0, -48.0), (-11.0, -48.0), and (-9.0, -48.0)\n- Burner Inserters at positions (-15.5, -48.5), (-14.5, -46.5), and (-14.5, -45.5)\n- Wooden Chests at positions (-14.5, -48.5) and (-12.5, -49.5)\n- Iron Chest at position (-14.5, -47.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when extracting items from chests\n- Ensure that the target chest contains the items you wish to extract. Verify the chest's inventory before attempting to move items.\n\n### Errors when transferring iron ore to furnaces\n- Confirm that the furnaces have available space and are not full. Ensure that the furnaces are ready to receive iron ore before attempting to transfer.\n\n### Errors when moving items from mining drill drop positions\n- Check that the chests at the drop positions are not full. Empty the chests regularly to prevent mining operations from halting.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items."}
