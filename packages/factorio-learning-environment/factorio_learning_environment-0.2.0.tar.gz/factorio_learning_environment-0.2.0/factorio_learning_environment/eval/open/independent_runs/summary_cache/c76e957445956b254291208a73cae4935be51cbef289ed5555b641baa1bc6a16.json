{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-47.5, -123.5)\n- Boiler at position (-46.5, -121.0)\n- Steam Engine at position (-41.5, -117.5)\n- Pipe connections between these entities are currently not established.\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -73.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Stone Furnace at position (9.0, -64.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Stone Furnace at position (6.0, -62.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Inserter and Storage System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) not receiving electricity.\n- Wooden Chest at position (7.5, -61.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (6.5, -59.5) containing iron plates.\n- Small Electric Poles at various positions, not connected to a power network.\n\n### Laboratory\n- Lab with input of automation science packs, currently not powered.\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- Multiple PipeGroups at various positions, all currently empty and not connected to fluid systems.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure all pipes are correctly aligned and connected between the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine. Verify that the pipe connections are not obstructed and that they cover the necessary distance.\n\n### Steam Engine Not Generating Power\n- Verify that the steam engine is properly connected to the power network and receiving steam from the boiler. Ensure that the boiler is supplied with water and fuel.\n\n### Inserter Not Receiving Electricity\n- Check the connection of small electric poles to ensure they are part of a complete power network. Ensure that the poles are connected to a power source and that the inserter is within the range of the electric poles.\n\n### Boiler and Steam Engine Warnings\n- Address the warnings of \"no input liquid\" and \"no fluid present in connections\" by ensuring that the offshore pump is operational and connected to the boiler, and that the boiler is connected to the steam engine with a continuous pipe network."}
