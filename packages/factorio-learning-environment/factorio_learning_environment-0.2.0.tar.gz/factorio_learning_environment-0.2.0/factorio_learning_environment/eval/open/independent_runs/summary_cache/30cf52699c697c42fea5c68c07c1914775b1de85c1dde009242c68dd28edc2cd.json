{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position(-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position -15.0, -50.0) with coal as fuel and extracting iron ore from the nearby wooden chest at position (-14.5, -48.5). The drill is currently working but has a warning indicating that the chest at drop position is full.\n\n### Wooden Chest at position(-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest (position -14.5, -48.5) containing iron ore (413 units).\n\n### Stone Furnace at position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace (position 0.0, 0.0) with coal as fuel, currently full and unable to output iron plates due to full output status. It has iron ore (5 units) as input and iron plates (100 units) as output.\n\n### Additional Wooden Chest at position(2.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest (position 2.5, 0.5) containing iron ore (661 units) and iron plates (100 units).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when the chest at drop position is full\n- Empty the chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) to allow the Burner Mining Drill to continue mining.\n\n### Errors when the furnace result is full\n- Ensure that the output of the Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) is cleared to allow for further production of iron plates.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `coal`: int\n- `iron-ore`: int\n- `wood`: int\n- `iron-plate`: int"}
