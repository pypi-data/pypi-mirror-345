(New instance at steps 82, 84, 89)\n* Errors when using non-existent entities or variables:\n  - Ensure that the entity or variable exists before using it. (New instances at steps 88, 90, 91, 92, 93)\n* Errors when attempting to place an entity without having the required sub-ingredients:\n  - Ensure you have the required sub-ingredients to craft the entity before attempting to place it. (New instance at step 95)\n\n### NAMESPACE\n* Important variables:\n  - `furnace_iron`: Furnace entity, type: `Entity`\n  - `entity`: Entity object, type: `Entity`\n  - `to`: Unknown type, possibly an entity or position\n  - `drill_iron`: Electric mining drill entity, type: `Entity`\n  - `inserter_iron`: Inserter entity, type: `Entity`\n  - `assembler_gear`: Assembling machine entity, type: `Entity`\n* Utility functions:\n  - `insert_item(item_type: `Prototype`, target: `Entity`, quantity: `int`)"}
