{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Iron Chest at position (-5.5, -50.5) storing iron ore and iron plates.\n- Stone Furnaces at positions (-15.0, -48.0), (-13.0, -48.0), and (-11.0, -48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates. Each furnace is fueled by coal and currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (4.0, -60.0) fueled by coal, extracting resources and dropping them into a wooden chest.\n- Wooden Chests at positions (5.5, -60.5), (4.5, -58.5), and other nearby positions for storing extracted resources.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Multiple Wooden Chests at positions (-14.5, -50.5), (-13.5, -50.5), (-12.5, -50.5), (-11.5, -50.5), (-10.5, -50.5), (-9.5, -50.5), (-8.5, -50.5), (-7.5, -50.5), (-6.5, -50.5), and (-5.5, -50.5) storing iron plates. Some chests are full, indicating a need for better inventory management.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Full Inventory\n- Ensure that chests used for storing resources are not full to prevent interruptions in mining and production processes. Regularly check and empty chests to maintain workflow.\n\n### Errors with No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Ensure that furnaces have a consistent supply of raw materials (iron ore) to avoid idle time. Automate the supply chain to keep furnaces running efficiently.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- None defined in the current logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `iron_ore_count: int` - Tracks the amount of iron ore available.\n- `iron_plate_count: int` - Tracks the amount of iron plates produced and stored.\n- `coal_count: int` - Tracks the amount of coal available for fueling machines.\n\nNo utility functions were defined or invoked in the provided logs."}
