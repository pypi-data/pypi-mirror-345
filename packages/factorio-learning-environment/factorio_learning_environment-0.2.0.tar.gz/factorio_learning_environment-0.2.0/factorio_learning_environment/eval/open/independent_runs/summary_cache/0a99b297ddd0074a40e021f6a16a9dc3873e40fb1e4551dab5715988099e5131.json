{"content": "# Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-59.5, -111.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (-59.5, -111.5)\n- Boiler at position (-46.5, -122.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-68.5, -95.5)\n- Pipe connections between the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -76.0) connected to an Iron Chest at position (-15.5, -77.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -73.0) for smelting iron ore\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (9.0, -64.0) for smelting copper ore\n- Stone Furnace at position (6.0, -62.0) with an Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) for moving items into a Wooden Chest at position (6.5, -59.5)\n\n### Storage Facilities\n- Iron Chest at position (-15.5, -77.5) containing iron ore\n- Wooden Chest at position (7.5, -61.5) containing iron plates\n- Wooden Chest at position (6.5, -59.5) containing iron ore, iron plates, and copper plates\n\n### Research Lab\n- Lab with no research in progress, requires automation science packs\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- Multiple Pipe Groups connecting various fluid systems, some are empty and some are full\n\n### Electrical Network\n- Small Electric Poles connecting various entities, but not all are receiving power\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure that the positions of entities are correctly aligned and within the connection range when attempting to connect pipes. Verify that there are no obstructions or misalignments in the intended path of the pipe connections.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Power\n- Ensure that all entities requiring electricity are connected to a powered electric pole. Check the power network to ensure it is properly supplying electricity to all connected entities.\n\n### Errors Due to Full Inventory\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are full to prevent interruptions in mining and production processes.\n\n### Errors Due to Missing Ingredients\n- Ensure that all required ingredients are available for entities like furnaces and assemblers to function correctly. Regularly supply these entities with necessary materials to maintain continuous production."}
