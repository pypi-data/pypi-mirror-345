{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line (around position x=3.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of 4 parallel smelting units:\n- 4 Stone furnaces at positions (0.0, 0.0), (2.0, 0.0), (4.0, 0.0), (6.0, 0.0)\n- Input inserters at positions (0.5, -1.5), (2.5, -1.5), (4.5, -1.5), (6.5, -1.5)\n- Output inserters at positions (0.5, 1.5), (2.5, 1.5), (4.5, 1.5), (6.5, 1.5)\n- Input coal/ore chests at positions (0.5, -2.5), (2.5, -2.5), (4.5, -2.5), (6.5, -2.5)\n- Output iron plate chests at positions (0.5, 2.5), (2.5, 2.5), (4.5, 2.5), (6.5, 2.5)\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Setup (around position x=-8.0, y=-59.0)\nConsists of 3 mining drills in a row:\n- Burner mining drills at positions (-10.0, -59.0), (-8.0, -59.0), (-6.0, -59.0)\n- Output wooden chests at positions (-9.5, -57.5), (-7.5, -57.5), (-5.5, -57.5)\n\n### Copper Ore Mining Setup (around position x=-28.0, y=-61.0)\nConsists of:\n- Single burner mining drill at position (-28.0, -61.0)\n- Currently has no output storage, warnings indicate output is blocked\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when crafting items requiring smelting\n- Automation science packs require copper plates which cannot be crafted directly\n- Set up proper smelting facilities for copper plates before attempting to craft items requiring them\n\n### Errors when placing entities without having them in inventory\n- Ensure you have the required entity in your inventory before attempting to place it\n- In this case, craft or acquire more burner mining drills before trying to place them\n\n### Errors with mining drill outputs being blocked\n- Always place a chest or other storage entity at the output position of mining drills\n- Check the mining drill's drop position and ensure it's clear or has a valid output entity"}
