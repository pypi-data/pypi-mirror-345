{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-9.5, 24.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Boiler at position (-5.5, 25.0)\n- Steam Engine at position (-12.5, 24.5)\n- Steam Engine at position (-0.5, 25.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting various components, including positions such as (-1.5, 17.5), (-3.5, 19.5), (-2.5, 19.5), etc.\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at positions such as (7.5, 10.5), (15.5, 2.5), (11.5, 6.5), etc.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (15.0, 0.0) with coal fuel and iron-plate output\n- Wooden Chests at positions (5.5, 0.5) and (18.5, 0.5)\n- Inserters at positions (17.5, 0.5) and (16.5, 0.5) for moving items between chests and furnace\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Power Connectivity\n- Ensure that all components of the electricity generator are properly connected to the power network. Check connections between the steam engines, boiler, and offshore pump to ensure liquid and power flow.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Not Receiving Power\n- Verify that inserters are connected to a power source and that the power network is active. Place electric poles to extend the power network to all inserters.\n\n### Errors with Full Inventory in Boiler\n- Before attempting to insert items into the boiler, check its inventory capacity. Avoid inserting items when the inventory is full to prevent errors.\n\n### Errors with Fluid Connections\n- Ensure that all fluid connections between the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engines are correctly established. Check for any missing pipes or incorrect connections that might prevent fluid flow."}
