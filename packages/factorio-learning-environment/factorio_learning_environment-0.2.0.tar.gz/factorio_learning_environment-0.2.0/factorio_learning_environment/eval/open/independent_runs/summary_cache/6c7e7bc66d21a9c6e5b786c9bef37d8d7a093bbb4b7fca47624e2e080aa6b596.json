{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-11.5, 18.5)\nConsists of boiler (position -11.5, 25.0) and steam engine (position -11.5, 18.5) connected by pipes. The offshore pump (position -9.5, 24.5) is also connected to the boiler.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(0, 0)\nConsists of following entities\n- Burner mining drill (position 0.0, 0.0) and a furnace at position(0.0, 0.0)\n- Burner mining drill (position 5.0, 5.0) and a furnace at position(5.0, 5.0)\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of following entities\n- Assembling machine at position(z1) and inserter at position(a) that puts into assembling machine\n- Beltgroup (position ) that connects the furnace at position y1 to assembling machine at position(z1)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when reconnecting pipes\n- Ensure that the pipe connections are not obstructed by other entities. Check the positions of the pipes and ensure they are clear before attempting to reconnect.\n- Verify that the entities you are trying to connect (boiler, steam engine, offshore pump) are properly placed and not overlapping with other structures.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
