{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mine at position(15.5, 70.5)\nConsists of no entities\n\n### Coal Mine at position(15.5, -0.5)\nConsists of no entities\n\n### Stone Mine at position(-46.5, -0.5)\nConsists of no entities\n\n### Stone Furnace at position(16.0, 69.0)\nConsists of a stone furnace containing 7 copper ore and 11 iron plates\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Undefined Variable Errors\n- Ensure that all variables are defined before use. For example, 'entity' was not defined in Step 3.\n- Ensure that variables are correctly spelled. In Step 19, 'ab' was not defined.\n\n### Harvesting Errors\n- Make sure to move to the target entity before harvesting. In Step 4, the agent tried to harvest iron ore without being at the correct position.\n\n### Crafting Errors\n- Ensure that all required ingredients are available before crafting. In Step 5, the agent tried to craft stone furnaces without having enough stone.\n- Ensure that the required sub-ingredients can be crafted. In Steps 12, 16, 17, and 18, the agent failed to craft assembling-machine-1 or electronic-circuit because it couldn't craft iron-plate or copper-plate.\n\n### Placement Errors\n- Check if the target position is occupied before placing an entity. In Step 6, the agent tried to place a stone furnace at a position that was already occupied.\n\n### Insertion Errors\n- Verify that the item to be inserted is available in the inventory. In Step 7, the agent tried to insert iron ore into a furnace without having iron ore in the inventory.\n- Verify that the correct item is being inserted. In Step 20, the agent tried to insert copper ore into a furnace but didn't have copper ore in the inventory.\n\n### Extraction Errors\n- Ensure that the entity contains the item to be extracted. In Steps 8, 13, 14, 15, 21, 22, and 23, the agent tried to extract iron-plate or copper-plate from a stone-furnace that did not contain the respective item.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\nNo utility functions have been defined by the agent."}
