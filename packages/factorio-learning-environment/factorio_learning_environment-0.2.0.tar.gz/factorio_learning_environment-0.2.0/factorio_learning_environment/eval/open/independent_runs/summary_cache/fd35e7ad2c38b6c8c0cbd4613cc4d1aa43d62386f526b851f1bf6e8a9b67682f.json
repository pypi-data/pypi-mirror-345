Avoid using unexpected keyword arguments (e.g., \u201cradius\u201d) or providing an incorrect number of positional arguments.\n\n\u2022 Entity Retrieval and Iteration\n  \u2013 Validate that the result of entity retrieval (e.g., existing_labs) is not None before attempting to iterate over it. Use a safe fallback (such as an empty list) to prevent NoneType errors.\n\n\u2022 Lab Placement and Crafting\n  \u2013 Check that the required Lab item is available in the inventory before attempting placement.\n  \u2013 Ensure that all prerequisite resources and sub-ingredients (iron\u2010gear-wheels, electronic circuits, copper cables, and their component copper plates) are sufficiently available and that the associated production chain is fully operational before initiating Lab crafting.\n\nNAMESPACE\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n(No agent-defined utility functions were identified.)"}
