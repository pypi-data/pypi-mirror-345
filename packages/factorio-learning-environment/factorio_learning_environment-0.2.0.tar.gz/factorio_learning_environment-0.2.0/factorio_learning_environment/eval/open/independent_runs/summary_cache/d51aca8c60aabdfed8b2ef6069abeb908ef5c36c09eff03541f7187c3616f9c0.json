The agent repeatedly attempted to supply a Lab for receiving Automation Science Packs at (0.5, 2.5), but all placement and crafting attempts failed due to inventory shortages and missing sub\u2010ingredients. In addition, two furnace entities were identified and used for resource processing:\n \n### Iron Smelting Furnace at Position (5.0, 5.0)\nUsed for converting iron ore into iron plates.\n \n### Copper Smelting Furnace at Position (\u201327.0, \u201360.0)\nUsed for converting copper ore into copper plates.\n \n(Note: These furnace structures appear to be pre\u2010existing facilities that the agent interacted with rather than newly constructed structures.)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 API Parameter Misuse  \n\u2003\u2013 When invoking get_entities, do not supply unsupported keywords (e.g. avoid using \u201cradius\u201d) or excess positional arguments.  \n\u2003\u2013 Review the function\u2019s signature and pass parameters in the expected format to prevent TypeErrors and unexpected argument errors.\n\n\u2022 Lab Placement and Crafting Issues  \n\u2003\u2013 Confirm that a Lab unit is present in the inventory before attempting placement at (0.5, 2.5).  \n\u2003\u2013 Verify that all required sub\u2010ingredients (such as iron-gear-wheels, electronic circuits, and copper cables) are available or can be produced with available facilities prior to crafting a Lab.  \n\u2003\u2013 When processing the returned entities (e.g. filtering labs), check for a None value and use a fallback (like an empty list) to avoid \u201cNoneType object is not iterable\u201d errors.\n\n\u2022 Resource Dependency Verification  \n\u2003\u2013 Monitor inventory levels and resource chains to ensure that essential base items (like iron plates and copper plates) are available to support subsequent crafting requirements.\n\n"}
