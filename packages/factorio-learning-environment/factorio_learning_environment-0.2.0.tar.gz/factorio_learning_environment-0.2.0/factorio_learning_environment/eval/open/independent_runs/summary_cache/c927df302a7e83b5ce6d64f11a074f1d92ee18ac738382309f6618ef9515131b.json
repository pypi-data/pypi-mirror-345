Remove the unsupported keyword argument (e.g. \u201cradius\u201d) and verify that the number of positional arguments matches the API\u2019s specification.\n\n\u2022 Lab Placement Failure:\n  \u2013 Confirm that a Lab is available in the inventory before attempting placement at (0.5, 2.5). Validate resource availability to meet all placement prerequisites.\n\n\u2022 Iterating Over a None Value:\n  \u2013 Check that get_entities returns a valid iterable. When a None value is possible, use a fallback (such as an empty list) before filtering or iteration.\n\n\u2022 Insufficient Ingredient Errors for Lab Crafting:\n  \u2013 Ensure all sub-ingredients (e.g. iron-gear-wheel, electronic-circuit, copper-cable) for Lab crafting are sufficiently stocked or producible.  \n  \u2013 Pre-coordinate precursor production (including smelting and intermediate crafting) so that each required component is available prior to initiating Lab synthesis.\n\n\u2022 Repeated Lab Crafting Failures:\n  \u2013 Monitor critical resource counts and craft missing components ahead of time to avoid recurring shortages during Lab creation attempts."}
