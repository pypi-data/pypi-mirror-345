{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (-1.5, 24.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe Group connecting these entities with fluid system 408\n\n### Iron Plate Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0) with a warning of no ingredients to smelt\n- Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0) with a warning of no ingredients to smelt\n- Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5) for storage\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) connected to the furnaces and chest\n- Small Electric Poles providing power to the inserter and other entities\n\n### Lab Setup\nConsists of:\n- Lab at Position (6.5, -57.5) connected to power source at Position (-1.5, 26.5)\n- Lab input contains 12 automation science packs but currently has no research in progress\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Pipe Connections\n- Ensure that pipes are correctly aligned and connected between the offshore pump and boiler. Check for obstructions or incorrect positioning that may prevent successful connections.\n\n### Errors in Research Initiation\n- Verify that the lab has the necessary science packs and is correctly powered. Ensure that a research task is selected and active to avoid idle labs.\n\n### Errors with Fuel Management\n- Regularly check fuel levels in boilers and furnaces to prevent warnings of \"out of fuel\" and ensure continuous operation.\n\n### Errors when Using Extracting but Being Too Far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when Placing into a Tile Which is Occupied by Another Entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placement."}
