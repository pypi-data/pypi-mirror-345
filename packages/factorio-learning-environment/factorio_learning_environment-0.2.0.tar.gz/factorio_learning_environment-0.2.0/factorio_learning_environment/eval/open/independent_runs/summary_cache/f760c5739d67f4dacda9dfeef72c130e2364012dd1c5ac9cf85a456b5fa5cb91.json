{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Automation Science Pack Production Line (around x=8.5, y=13.5)\nConsists of following entities:\n- Assembling machine-1 at position (x=8.5, y=13.5)\n- Iron gear input:\n  - Wooden chest at (x=7.5, y=10.5) containing iron gears\n  - Burner inserter at (x=8.5, y=10.5)\n- Output system:\n  - Burner inserter at (x=10.5, y=13.5)\n  - Wooden chest at (x=11.5, y=13.5)\n- Transport belt system connecting components with 11 belts from (x=8.5, y=11.5) to (x=1.5, y=16.5)\n\n### Power Generation System (around x=-4.5, y=12.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam engine at (x=-4.5, y=12.5)\n- Boiler at (x=-4.5, y=16.0)\n- Offshore pump at (x=-3.5, y=27.5)\n- Multiple pipe groups connecting water flow\n- Electric pole network connecting various entities\n\n### Mining and Smelting Setups\nMultiple setups consisting of:\n1. Setup at (-28.0, -61.0):\n   - Burner mining drill\n   - Wooden chest at (-27.5, -59.5)\n   - Burner inserter at (-26.5, -59.5)\n   - Stone furnace at (-25.0, -59.0)\n   - Output inserter at (-23.5, -58.5)\n   - Output chest at (-22.5, -58.5)\n\n2. Setup at (-18.0, -53.0):\n   - Burner mining drill\n   - Wooden chest at (-17.5, -51.5)\n   - Burner inserter at (-16.5, -51.5)\n   - Stone furnace at (-15.0, -51.0)\n   - Output inserter at (-13.5, -50.5)\n   - Output chest at (-12.5, -50.5)\n\n3. Coal mining setup at (41.0, -82.0):\n   - Burner mining drill\n   - Wooden chest at (41.5, -80.5)\n   - Burner inserter at (41.5, -79.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Conflicts\n- Check for existing entities before placing new ones - multiple attempts to place inserters and chests where entities already exist\n- When placing entities next to each other, verify the spacing parameter is appropriate for the available space\n- Consider the full dimensions of larger entities (like assembling machines) when placing items nearby\n\n### Power System Issues\n- Ensure power generating equipment (boilers) have fuel\n- Connect all electrical entities to the power network through electric poles\n\n### Production Line Setup\n- Verify all required input materials are available before setting up production chains\n- Ensure proper connections between input chests, inserters and assembling machines\n- Check that inserters are properly oriented to pick up and drop items in the correct direction\n\n### Resource Management\n- Keep mining drills fueled to maintain continuous resource extraction\n- Ensure sufficient fuel distribution to all burner-type entities\n- Stock input materials before starting automated production"}
