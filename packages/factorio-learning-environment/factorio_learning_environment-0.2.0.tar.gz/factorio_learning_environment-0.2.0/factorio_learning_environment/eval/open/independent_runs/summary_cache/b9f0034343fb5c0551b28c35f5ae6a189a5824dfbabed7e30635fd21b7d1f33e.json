Remove any existing entities that may obstruct placement.\n\n### Offshore Pump Connection Issues\n- Verify that the offshore pump is correctly connected to a fluid system. Ensure all necessary connections are established to avoid disconnection errors.\n\n### Inserter Power Issues\n- Check that inserters are connected to a power source. Ensure the electricity network is properly set up to supply power to all inserters."}
