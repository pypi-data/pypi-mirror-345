{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll generate a comprehensive report:\n\n# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining System (around position x=41, y=-82)\n- Burner mining drill (position 41.0, -82.0) mining coal\n- Two iron chests for coal storage:\n  - At position (41.5, -84.5) containing 1600 coal\n  - At position (41.5, -83.5) containing 797 coal\n\n### Iron Smelting System (around position x=46, y=-81)\n- Two stone furnaces:\n  - Left furnace at position (45.0, -81.0)\n  - Right furnace at position (47.0, -81.0)\n- Input system:\n  - Input chest at position (46.5, -77.5) containing iron ore\n  - Two burner inserters for furnace feeding:\n    - Left inserter at (45.5, -79.5)\n    - Right inserter at (47.5, -79.5)\n- Output system:\n  - Two burner inserters for output handling:\n    - Left inserter at (45.5, -82.5)\n    - Right inserter at (47.5, -82.5)\n  - Output chest at position (46.5, -83.5)\n\n### Storage System\n- Multiple wooden chests for resource storage:\n  - Coal storage chest at (49.5, -80.5) containing 800 coal\n  - Product storage chest at (49.5, -79.5) containing coal and iron plates\n  - Additional wooden chest at (45.5, -84.5)\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n- When placing entities, ensure the target location is clear of other objects\n- Consider the orientation and spacing requirements when rebuilding inserter systems\n- Pay attention to the relative positions between inserters and their target entities (chests/furnaces)\n- When rebuilding systems, verify that inserters can reach both their pickup and drop positions\n\n# NAMESPACE\n\n### Important Variables\n- `left_inserter`: BurnerInserter\n- `right_inserter`: BurnerInserter\n\n### System States\n- Input chest contents tracking\n- Furnace status monitoring\n- Inserter operational status checking\n\nThe logs show multiple attempts at rebuilding and reorienting an inserter system, with careful attention to positioning and orientation to ensure proper material flow between chests and furnaces."}
