sentidict
============

TL;DR
a python 3 package for dictionary based sentiment

This script provides many different sentiment dictionaries for performing sentiment analysis.
It has grown out of a project to make a particular dataset,
the language assessment by Mechanical Turk (labMT) word list,
accessible to wider range of people.
The labMT word list was created by combining the 5000 words most frequently appearing in four sources:
Twitter, the New York Times, Google Books, and music lyrics, and then scoring the words for sentiment on Amazon's Mechanical Turk.
The list is described in detail in the publication Dodds' et al. 2011, PLOS ONE, "Temporal Patterns of Happiness and Information in a Global-Scale Social Network: Hedonometrics and Twitter."
