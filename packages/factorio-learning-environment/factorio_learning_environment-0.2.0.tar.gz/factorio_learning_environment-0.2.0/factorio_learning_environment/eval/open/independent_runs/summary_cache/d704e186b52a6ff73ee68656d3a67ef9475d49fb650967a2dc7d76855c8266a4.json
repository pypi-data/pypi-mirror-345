{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Coal Mining Setup at Position (41.0, -82.0)\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (41.0, -82.0) with a drop position at (41.5, -80.5).\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (43.0, -82.0) with a drop position at (43.5, -80.5).\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (41.5, -80.5) with pickup position at (41.5, -81.5) and drop position at (41.5, -79.5).\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (41.5, -79.5) for storing coal.\n- **Belt Group** connecting the mining drills to the inserter and chest, with belts running from (43.5, -80.5) to (45.5, -80.5) and from (43.5, -77.5) to (42.5, -78.5).\n\n#### Stone Furnace at Position (-13.0, -50.0)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-13.0, -50.0) with fuel inventory containing 12 coal. Currently idle due to lack of ingredients.\n\n---\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Ensure the target tile is free before placing entities like inserters or belts. For example, the burner inserter at (41.5, -80.5) could not be placed initially due to an existing object.\n\n#### Errors when connecting entities with transport belts\n- Verify the path length and ensure there are no obstructions when connecting entities with belts. Repeated errors occurred when trying to connect the burner inserter at (41.5, -80.5) to the burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0). Clear any obstructions along the belt path.\n\n#### Errors when retrieving entities\n- Ensure the entity exists at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it. For example, the wooden chest at (41.5, -79.5) was not found initially because it had not been placed yet.\n\n#### Errors due to blocked outputs\n- Clear any blocked items near drill outputs to ensure smooth operation. Repeated errors occurred due to blocked items near the drill outputs at (41.0, -82.0) and (43.0, -82.0).\n\n#### Errors due to invalid belt positions\n- Ensure belt positions are valid and free from obstructions. Repeated errors occurred when trying to create a belt at (42.5, -79.5). Clear obstructions and verify the path before placing belts.\n\n#### Errors due to insufficient fuel in mining drills\n- Ensure mining drills have sufficient fuel to operate. The burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0) ran out of fuel, causing it to stop functioning. Regularly check and refill fuel in mining drills.\n\n#### Errors due to blocked inserter operations\n- Ensure inserters have a clear path to pick up and drop items. The burner inserter at (41.5, -80.5) was unable to pick up items due to obstructions. Clear any items blocking the inserter's path.\n\n#### Errors due to incorrect belt connections\n- Verify the direction and connections of belts to ensure they are correctly linked. Repeated errors occurred when trying to connect the burner inserter at (41.5, -80.5) to the burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0). Double-check belt connections and directions."}
