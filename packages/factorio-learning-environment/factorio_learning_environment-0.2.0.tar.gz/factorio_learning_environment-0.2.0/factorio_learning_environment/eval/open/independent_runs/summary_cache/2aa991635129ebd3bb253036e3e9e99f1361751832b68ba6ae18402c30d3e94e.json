{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nNo structures have been successfully created on the map as of the current steps. All placement attempts for structures such as Wooden Chests, Burner Mining Drills, and Stone Furnaces have failed.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure that the target position for placing entities like Wooden Chests, Burner Mining Drills, and Stone Furnaces is not occupied or obstructed by other entities or terrain features. Verify that the position is suitable for placement before attempting to place the entity.\n\n### Errors related to incorrect API usage\n- When using functions like `get_entities`, ensure that the arguments provided are of the correct type. For example, when specifying a position, ensure it is a valid Position object rather than a string or incorrect data type.\n\n### General placement errors\n- Double-check the coordinates and ensure there is enough space for the entity you are trying to place. If the placement returns false, reassess the position and ensure it meets the requirements for the entity type.\n\n### Consistent failure to place structures\n- Review the map and inventory to ensure that the placement logic aligns with the available resources and space. Consider repositioning or clearing the intended area before attempting to place structures again."}
