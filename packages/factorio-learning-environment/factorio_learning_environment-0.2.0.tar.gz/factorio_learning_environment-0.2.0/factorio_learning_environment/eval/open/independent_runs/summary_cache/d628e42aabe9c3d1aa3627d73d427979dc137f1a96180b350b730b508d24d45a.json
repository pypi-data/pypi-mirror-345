{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n-----------------------\n### Extraction System at position (\u20133.5, 27.5)\nConsists of:\n\u2013 Extraction system burner inserter located at (\u20133.5, 27.5) with a drop position at (\u20133.5, 28.5)  \nUse-case: Initiates the transfer of copper plates from the extraction area into the belt network.\n\n### Copper Cable Factory Interface at position (2.5, 17.5)\nConsists of:\n\u2013 Cable factory input chest at (2.5, 17.5)  \n\u2013 New factory burner inserter at (3.5, 17.5) with a drop position at (4.5, 17.5) and using direction RIGHT  \nUse-case: Serves as the receiving interface for copper plates that will be processed into copper cable.\n\n### Belt Depot Structure at position (3.5, 15.5)\nConsists of:\n\u2013 Depot wooden chest placed at (3.5, 15.5) acting as an isolated belt depot  \n\u2013 Transport belt segment adjacent to the chest at (4.5, 15.5)  \n\u2013 Depot burner inserter placed at (3.5, 14.5) with a pickup position aligning with the depot chest  \nUse-case: Functions as an intermediary transfer node, intended to receive copper plates from the extraction system before onward transport.\n\nERROR TIPS\n-----------------------\n\u2022 Transport Belt Connection Issues  \n\u2003\u2013 When connecting transport belts, do not target an entity that is interpreted as a Prototype.SteamEngine. Instead, add an inserter that inputs items into the target and use that as the connection point.\n\n\u2022 Entity Placement Range Error  \n\u2003\u2013 Ensure the player has moved close enough to the intended target position (within the allowed placement distance) before attempting to place an entity.\n\n\u2022 Inventory Shortage  \n\u2003\u2013 Confirm that the necessary item (e.g., a wooden chest) is present in your inventory before executing a placement command.\n\n\u2022 Variable Naming Errors  \n\u2003\u2013 Verify that all variables (such as the intended target chest) are properly defined and referenced to avoid NameError exceptions."}
