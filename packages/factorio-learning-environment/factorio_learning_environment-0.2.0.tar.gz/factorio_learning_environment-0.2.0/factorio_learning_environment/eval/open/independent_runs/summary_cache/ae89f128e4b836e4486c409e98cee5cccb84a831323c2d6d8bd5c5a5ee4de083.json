The agent made several attempts to establish a Lab at position (0.5, 2.5) in order to supply Automation Science Packs for research, but all such attempts failed because no Lab item was available and required sub\u2010ingredients were missing. Although retrieval operations referenced pre\u2010existing smelting facilities (an alternative furnace at Position(x=5.0, y=5.0) and a copper furnace at Position(x=-27.0, y=-60.0)) for resource processing, none of these were newly built structures assembled by the agent.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022\u2003Incorrect API usage for get_entities:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Avoid using unexpected keywords (e.g. \u201cradius\u201d) or supplying extra positional arguments.
