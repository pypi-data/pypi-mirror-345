{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Complex at (-10.0, -59.0)\nConsists of three burner mining drills in a row with wooden chests:\n- First drill at (-10.0, -59.0) with wooden chest at (-9.5, -57.5)\n- Second drill at (-8.0, -59.0) with wooden chest at (-7.5, -57.5)\n- Third drill at (-6.0, -59.0) with wooden chest at (-5.5, -57.5)\nAll drills are working and mining iron ore\n\n### Iron Plate Smelting Line (0.0, 0.0)\nComplex smelting setup consisting of:\n- Four stone furnaces at positions (0.0, 0.0), (2.0, 0.0), (4.0, 0.0), and (6.0, 0.0)\n- Input wooden chests at (0.5, -2.5), (2.5, -2.5), (4.5, -2.5), and (6.5, -2.5)\n- Burner inserters at (0.5, -1.5), (2.5, -1.5), (4.5, -1.5), and (6.5, -1.5) moving items from input chests to furnaces\n- Output wooden chests at (0.5, 2.5), (2.5, 1.5), (4.5, 1.5), and (6.5, 1.5)\n- Output burner inserter at (0.5, 1.5) moving items from first furnace to output chest\n- Additional burner inserter at (7.5, 0.5) for the rightmost furnace\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Output Blocking Issues\n- Multiple inserters are showing \"output blocked by item on the ground\" warnings\n- Ensure proper placement of destination entities (chests/belts) at inserter drop positions\n- Check that the output path for inserters is clear and has a valid destination entity\n\n### Chest Capacity Management\n- Mining drill warning about full chest at (-5.5, -57.5)\n- Regularly empty output chests to prevent production stoppage\n- Consider implementing an automated collection system for chest contents\n\n### Inserter Configuration\n- Some inserters are waiting for source items\n- Verify the pickup and drop positions are correctly configured\n- Ensure source entities contain items that inserters can pick up"}
