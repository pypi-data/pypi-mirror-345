{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, y=-48.0 to -11.0, y=-48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, y=-48.0) with inventory: coal (10), iron ore (2), producing iron plates (71).\n- Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, y=-48.0) with inventory: coal (10), iron ore (2), producing iron plates (71).\n- Stone Furnace at position (-11.0, y=-48.0) with inventory: coal (15), iron ore (2), producing iron plates (71).\n\n### Iron Ore Storage and Processing at Position (4.5, y=-58.5 to -5.5, y=-50.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (4.0, y=-60.0) fueled by coal (5), extracting iron ore, with a drop position at (4.5, y=-58.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (4.5, y=-58.5) storing iron ore (157).\n- Iron Chest at position (-5.5, y=-50.5) storing iron ore (418) and iron plates (1359).\n\n### Coal Supply Chain\n- Coal is harvested from the coal patch at position (40.5, y=-82.5) and inserted into the burner mining drill at position (4.0, y=-60.0).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Full Chests\n- Ensure that chests are emptied regularly to prevent mining drills from halting due to full storage. The chest at position (4.5, y=-58.5) is full, which stops the mining drill from continuing its operation.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Input\n- Ensure that furnaces have a continuous supply of both fuel and raw materials to maintain production efficiency. Check inventory levels regularly to avoid production stalls.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- None defined in the current steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `coal`: int, representing the amount of coal in inventory.\n- `iron_ore`: int, representing the amount of iron ore in inventory.\n- `iron_plate`: int, representing the amount of iron plates in inventory."}
