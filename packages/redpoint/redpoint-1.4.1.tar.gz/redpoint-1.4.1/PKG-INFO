# 🔴 redpoint

Converting climbing grades made easy!

`🔴 redpoint` is a Python library that simplifies climbing grade conversions.  It supports a wide range of climbing grade systems (sport, bouldering, and more) from thecrag.com, allowing users to easily convert between systems (e.g., YDS to French), compare the difficulty of grades, and even generate ranges of equivalent grades.

## Overview

Converting the grades between the systems:

```python
from redpoint import Grade

Grade("5.12a", "YDS").to("French")  # <7a+, 'French'>
```

when typing `Grade` gets tedious, individual systems can be imported as well:

```python
from grading.systems import YDS

YDS("5.12a").to("French")  # <7a+, 'French'>
```

Comparing the difficulty of grades:

```python
Grade("5.14a", "YDS") > Grade("8a", "French")  # True
Grade("V11", "V-Scale") == Grade("8A", "Fontainebleau")  # True
UIAA("4") >= Ewbanks("33")  # False
```

Getting the range of the grade in different system:

```python
Brittish("5a").to_range("French")  # [<5b, 'French'>, <5b+, 'French'>, <5c, 'French'>, <5c+, 'French'>, <6a, 'French'>]
```

For the full list of features check out the [documentation](https://ciszko.github.io/redpoint/).
