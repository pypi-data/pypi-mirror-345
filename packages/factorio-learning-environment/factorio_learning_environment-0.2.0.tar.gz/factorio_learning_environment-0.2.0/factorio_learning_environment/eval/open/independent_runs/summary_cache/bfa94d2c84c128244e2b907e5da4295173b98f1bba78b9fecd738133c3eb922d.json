{"content": "# Factorio Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position (10, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam engine at position (10.0, 0.0)\n- Boiler at position (10.0, 1.0)\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n\n### Copper plate factory at position (1, 1)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (1.0, 1.0)\n- Chest at position (3.5, 1.5)\n- Burner inserter at position (8.5, 1.5)\n- Furnace at position (10.0, 1.0)\n\n### Additional structures\n- Chest at position (3.5, 3.5)\n- Chest at position (3.5, 5.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing electric poles\n- Ensure the target location for placing electric poles is clear of obstacles. If the area is blocked or unplaceable (e.g., water), the placement will fail.\n\n### Errors when attempting to retrieve entities\n- Verify the position of the entity you are trying to retrieve. If the entity does not exist at the specified position, the retrieval will fail. \n\n### General tips\n- Regularly check the map for existing entities that may block new constructions.\n- Ensure you are in proximity to the entities you wish to interact with to avoid distance-related errors."}
