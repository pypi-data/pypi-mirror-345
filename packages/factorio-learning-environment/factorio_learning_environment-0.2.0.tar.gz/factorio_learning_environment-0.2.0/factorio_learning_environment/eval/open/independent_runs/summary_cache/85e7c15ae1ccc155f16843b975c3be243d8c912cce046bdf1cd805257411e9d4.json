{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-20.0, -70.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (-20.0, -70.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Furnace at position (-18.0, -70.0) actively working with iron ore supply.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-20.5, -66.5) waiting for source items.\n- BeltGroup connecting furnaces and inserters for efficient material transport.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining Facility at Position (-23.5, -69.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) extracting copper ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-23.5, -69.5) storing extracted copper ore.\n- Transport Belt network connecting the mining drill to the chest.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Facility at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-12.5, -54.5) storing extracted iron ore.\n- Transport Belt network connecting the mining drill to the chest.\n\n### Miscellaneous Storage and Transport\n- Multiple Wooden Chests at various positions for storing coal, iron ore, and iron plates.\n- Several BeltGroups facilitating the movement of materials across different facilities.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items into furnaces\n- Ensure that the inventory contains the items you wish to insert into the furnace. Check your inventory for the required items before attempting to insert.\n\n### Errors when using inserters waiting for source items\n- Verify that the source items are available and accessible to the inserter. Adjust the transport belt or source item placement if necessary to ensure the inserter can pick up items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placement. Check for existing entities occupying the target tile."}
