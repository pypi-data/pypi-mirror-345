{"content": "Here is the updated report incorporating steps 56-63:\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Operation at (15.5, 70.5)\n- Electric mining drill at (15.5, 70.5) extracting iron ore\n- Still disconnected from power network (status: NO_POWER)\n\n### Power Generation Plant at (55.5, 50.0) [NEW LOCATION]\n- Offshore pump at (-20.5, -3.5) (status: NOT_CONNECTED)\n- Boiler at (55.5, 50.0) with 20 coal (status: NOT_CONNECTED)\n- Steam engine at (58.5, 50.5) (status: NOT_CONNECTED)\n- Partial pipe network:\n  - Pipe at (51.5, 50.5)\n- Current issues:\n  - Broken connection between offshore pump and boiler\n  - Incomplete pipe network\n\n### New Smelting Setup at (25.0, 79.0)\n- Electric mining drill at (25.5, 75.5)\n- Stone furnace at (25.0, 79.0)\n- Input burner inserter at (25.5, 77.5)\n- Output wooden chest at (27.5, 79.5)\n- Output burner inserter at (26.5, 79.5)\n- Still non-functional due to power issues\n\n### Secondary Smelting Setup at (20.0, 73.0)\n- Electric mining drill at (20.5, 70.5)\n- Stone furnace at (20.0, 73.0)\n- Output wooden chest at (22.5, 73.5)\n- Still missing input inserter configuration\n\n### New Mining Operation at (20.5, 20.5)\n- Electric mining drill at (20.5, 20.5)\n- Still unconnected to any processing chain\n\n### New Furnace Setup at (20.0, 20.0)\n- Stone furnace at (20.0, 20.0) with 19 coal\n- Wooden chest at (21.5, 20.5)\n- Still idle due to missing input materials\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Persistent Placement Validation Failures\n- Multiple failed placements at (10.0,10.0) (steps 58,59,63)\n- Critical solutions:\n  - Implement pre-placement terrain validation\n  - Maintain clear area mapping\n  - Avoid water tiles for land-based structures\n\n### Power Plant Connection Issues\n- Continuing connection problems (steps 59,60,63)\n- Required fixes:\n  1. Complete pipe path from offshore pump to boiler\n  2. Verify boiler-to-engine steam connection\n  3. Ensure all connection points align\n\n### Resource Discovery Problems\n- Failed coal searches (steps 56,57,61,62)\n- Implement:\n  - Systematic spiral search patterns\n  - Resource cache system\n  - Fallback mining locations\n\n### Entity Collision Prevention\n- Continuing placement obstructions (steps 60,61)\n- Always:\n  - Scan 2x2 area for large entities\n  - Maintain minimum clearance buffers\n  - Implement placement validation wrapper\n\n### Fluid System Routing\n- Pipe placement failures (steps 59,60,61)\n- Critical checks:\n  - Verify path continuity before placement\n  - Maintain 1-tile spacing for large entities\n  - Implement alternative routing logic\n\n### Production Chain Verification\n- All production chains still non-functional\n- Verify:\n  1. Complete power connections\n  2. Fuel in all burner devices\n  3. Correct inserter alignment\n  4. Material flow paths\n\n### Variable Reference Errors\n- Undefined variables in resource search (step 57)\n- Always:\n  - Initialize all variables before use\n  - Maintain consistent naming conventions\n  - Implement variable validation checks\n\n### Inventory Management\n- Continuing resource shortages\n- Implement:\n  - Resource tracking system\n  - Minimum stock thresholds\n  - Emergency resource protocols\n\n### Location Selection Logic\n- Repeated failed placement attempts\n- Required improvements:\n  - Implement location scoring system\n  - Maintain buildable area map\n  - Add fallback position selection\n\n### System Status Monitoring\n- Missed connection status checks\n- Critical additions:\n  - Entity status verification\n  - Connection validation routines\n  - Automated repair triggers"}
