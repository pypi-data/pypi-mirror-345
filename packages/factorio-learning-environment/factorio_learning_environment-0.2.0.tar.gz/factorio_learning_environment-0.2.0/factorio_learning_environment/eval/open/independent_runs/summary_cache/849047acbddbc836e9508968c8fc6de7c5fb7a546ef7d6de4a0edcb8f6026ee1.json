{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (4.0, -60.0) with a drop position at (4.5, -58.5), currently out of fuel and with a full chest at the drop position.\n- Wooden Chests for storage at various positions:\n  - Position (5.5, -60.5) containing 183 iron plates.\n  - Position (4.5, -58.5) containing 494 iron ore.\n  - Position (-4.5, -52.5) containing 500 iron plates.\n  - Position (-5.5, -52.5) containing 232 iron ore.\n  - Position (-3.5, -52.5) containing 1476 iron plates.\n  - Position (-2.5, -52.5) containing 200 iron ore.\n  - Additional chests at positions (-14.5, -50.5) to (-10.5, -50.5) with varying inventories, some empty and others containing iron plates.\n\n### Iron Plate Smelting Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnaces at positions:\n  - Position (-15.0, -48.0) with 15 coal, no ingredients to smelt, and 34 iron plates in the result inventory.\n  - Position (-13.0, -48.0) with 11 coal, no ingredients to smelt, and 34 iron plates in the result inventory.\n  - Position (-11.0, -48.0) with 10 coal, no ingredients to smelt, and 1 iron plate in the result inventory.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Out of Fuel\n- Ensure that all Burner Mining Drills have sufficient fuel to operate. Regularly check fuel levels and replenish as necessary to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Errors due to Full Chests\n- Regularly monitor chest inventories and empty them when full to prevent stoppages in mining operations. Consider using larger capacity chests or setting up automated transport systems to manage overflow.\n\n### Errors due to No Ingredients in Furnaces\n- Ensure that stone furnaces have a continuous supply of raw materials to smelt. Regularly check and restock the furnace source inventories to avoid idle time.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined by the agent in the provided logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `iron-ore`: int, represents the quantity of iron ore in various inventories.\n- `iron-plate`: int, represents the quantity of iron plates in various inventories.\n- `iron-gear-wheel`: int, represents the quantity of iron gear wheels in the final inventory.\n- `wooden-chest`: int, represents the count of wooden chests in the final inventory."}
