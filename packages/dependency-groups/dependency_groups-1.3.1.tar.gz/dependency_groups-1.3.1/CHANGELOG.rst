CHANGELOG
=========

Unreleased
----------

1.3.1
-----

- Fix a bug in which names in includes were not normalized before comparisons,
  resulting in spurious ``LookupError``\s.
- Optimize the behavior of the ``resolve()`` function on multiple groups.

1.3.0
-----

- Bugfix: raise a ``TypeError`` on non-list groups (was ``ValueError``).
  Thanks :user:`henryiii`!

- Several improvements to the CLI interfaces! Thanks :user:`henryiii`!

  - Add support for a ``cli`` extra, as in
    ``pip install "dependency-groups[cli]"``, which ensures that ``tomli`` is
    present on older Pythons.

  - Add support for ``dependency-groups`` as an entrypoint, as an alias of
    ``python -m dependency_groups``.

  - The ``dependency-groups`` command now supports a ``--list`` flag to list
    groups instead of resolving them.

1.2.0
-----

- Switch to ``flit-core`` as the build backend
- Add support for supplying multiple dependency groups to the functional
  ``resolve()`` API: ``resolve(dependency_groups, *groups: str)``. Thanks
  :user:`henryiii`!
