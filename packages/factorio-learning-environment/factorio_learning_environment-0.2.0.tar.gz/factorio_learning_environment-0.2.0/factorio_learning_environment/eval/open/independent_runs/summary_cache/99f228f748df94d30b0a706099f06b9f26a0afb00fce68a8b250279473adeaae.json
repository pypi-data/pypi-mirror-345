Check connections to small electric poles for any disconnections.\n\n### Errors with no ingredients to smelt\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to operate. Check inventory and supply lines to ensure ingredients are available.\n\n### Errors with assembling machines not receiving electricity\n- Verify that assembling machines are connected to a power source and that the power supply is functional."}
