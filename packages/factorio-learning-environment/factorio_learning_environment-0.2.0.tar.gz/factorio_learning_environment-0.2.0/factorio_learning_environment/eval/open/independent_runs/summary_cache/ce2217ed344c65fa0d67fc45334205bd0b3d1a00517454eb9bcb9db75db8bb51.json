{"content": "# Factorio Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo structures have been created on the map yet.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n### Errors related to crafting items\n- Ensure that you have all required ingredients in your inventory before attempting to craft items. For example, to craft an iron gear wheel, you need iron plates, which require a furnace to produce.\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure that you have the required entity in your inventory before attempting to place it. For instance, you cannot place a stone furnace if it is not present in your inventory.\n- Make sure to check the position where you are trying to place an entity to ensure it is not occupied by another entity or invalid for placement. \n\n### Errors with type handling\n- When using functions that require specific data types, ensure that you are passing the correct type. For example, when specifying dimensions for a building box, ensure that the width and height are integers and not other types."}
