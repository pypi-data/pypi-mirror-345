{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Crude Oil Extraction and Processing at position (17.5, 40.5)\nConsists of a Pumpjack (position: x=17.5, y=40.5), Oil Refinery (position: x=23.5, y=43.5), and associated pipes and power poles.\n\n### Electricity Generation at position (-5.5, 2.0)\nConsists of a Boiler (position: x=-5.5, y=2.0), Steam Engine (position: x=-0.5, y=5.5), Offshore Pump (position: x=-9.5, y=-0.5), and associated pipes and power poles.\n\n### Water Supply at position (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of an Offshore Pump (position: x=-9.5, y=-0.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n* Errors when using undefined variables\n  - Ensure that all variables are defined before using them. For example, the error in steps 1, 2, and 9 was caused by using an undefined variable 'entity'.\n* Errors when placing entities at occupied or unplaceable positions\n  - Ensure that the target location is clear and placeable before attempting to place an entity. For example, the error in step 7 and 15 was caused by trying to place an entity at a location that was either occupied or unplaceable.\n* Errors when entities are not connected to power network\n  - Ensure that entities requiring power are connected to a power network. For example, the pumpjack at position (17.5, 40.5) and oil refinery at position (23.5, 43.5) were not initially connected to a power network.\n* Errors when entities are not connected properly\n  - Ensure that entities are connected properly. For example, the offshore pump at position (-9.5, -0.5) was not initially connected.\n* Errors when accessing list indices out of range\n  - Ensure that list indices are within the valid range before accessing them. For example, the error in step 10 was caused by trying to access an index that was out of range.\n* Errors when connecting entities without setting a recipe\n  - Ensure that a recipe is set for entities that require it before attempting to connect them. For example, the error in step 12 was caused by trying to connect the pumpjack to the oil refinery without setting a recipe.\n\n### NAMESPACE\nNo utility functions have been defined by the agent."}
