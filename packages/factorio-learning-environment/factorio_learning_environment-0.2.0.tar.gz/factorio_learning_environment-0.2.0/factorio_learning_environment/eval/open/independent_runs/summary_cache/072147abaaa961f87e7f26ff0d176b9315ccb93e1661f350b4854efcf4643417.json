{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nThere are currently no structures successfully established by the agent on the map. The logs indicate attempts to find suitable positions for placing structures, but no successful placements have been made.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Finding Suitable Positions for Offshore Pump\n- Ensure that the offshore pump is placed adjacent to a water source. The agent repeatedly failed to find a suitable position for the offshore pump, indicating a possible misunderstanding of the placement requirements. Check the map for valid water tiles and ensure the pump is placed directly next to them.\n\n### Errors in Boiler Placement\n- Verify the suitability of the terrain before attempting to place a boiler. The agent attempted to place a boiler at positions that were unsuitable multiple times. Consider examining the terrain and ensuring it is flat and clear of obstructions before placement.\n\n### General Placement Strategy\n- Before attempting to place any structure, confirm the suitability of the location by checking for obstructions and ensuring the terrain meets the requirements for the specific structure. This can prevent repeated failed placement attempts and optimize the construction process."}
