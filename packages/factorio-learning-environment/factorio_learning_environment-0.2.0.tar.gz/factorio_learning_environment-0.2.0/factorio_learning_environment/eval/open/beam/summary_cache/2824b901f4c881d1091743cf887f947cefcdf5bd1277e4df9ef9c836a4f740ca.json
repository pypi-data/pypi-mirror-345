Specifically, we need 2 units of wood, which we currently do not have in our inventory.\n\n### Current Inventory Status:\n- Coal: 10\n- Iron Ore: 10\n- **Missing:** 2 Wood\n\n### Current Furnace Status Recap:\n1. **First Furnace:**\n   - Fuel: 5 Coal\n   - Iron Ore: 4 (available for processing)\n   - Iron Plates Produced: 100 (total)\n   - Status: WORKING (currently processing)\n\n2. **Second Furnace:**\n   - Fuel: 7 Coal\n   - Iron Ore: 0 (none remaining, finished processing)\n   - Iron Plates Produced: 75 (total)\n   - Status: NO INGREDIENTS (currently idle)\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. We need to gather wood to craft the wooden chest. This can typically be done by harvesting trees.\n2. After gathering wood, we can proceed to craft the chest and store the iron plates.\n\nLet's find the nearest tree, move to it, and harvest some wood.\n\"\"\"\n\n# 1. Find the nearest tree position\ntree_position = nearest(Resource.Tree)\n\n# 2. Move to the tree position and harvest wood\nmove_to(tree_position)\nharvest_resource(tree_position, quantity=2)\n\n# 3.
