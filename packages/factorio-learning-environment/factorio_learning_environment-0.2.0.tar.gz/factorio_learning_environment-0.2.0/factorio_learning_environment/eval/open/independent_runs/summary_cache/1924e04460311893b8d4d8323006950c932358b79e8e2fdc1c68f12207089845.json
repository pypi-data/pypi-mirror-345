In step 85, an attempt was made to get a stone furnace at position (x=4.0, y=4.0), but no such entity was found. Double-check entity positions before accessing them.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
