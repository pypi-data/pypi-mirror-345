{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) storing extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Misalignment Issues\n- Ensure that inserters are correctly aligned with their source and destination. Misalignment can prevent the transfer of items. Verify both pickup and drop positions are correctly set.\n\n### Refueling Errors\n- Regularly check the fuel levels of all entities that require fuel, such as mining drills and inserters, to prevent interruptions in production. Maintain a sufficient coal supply in your inventory for refueling.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- If an inserter is waiting for source items, ensure that the source (e.g., chest or mining drill) contains the items to be transferred. Check the setup and alignment to ensure items can be transferred smoothly.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Iron Ore\n- Verify that the inserter transferring iron ore to the furnace is correctly positioned and operational. Ensure the chest contains iron ore and that the inserter is not misaligned or out of fuel."}
