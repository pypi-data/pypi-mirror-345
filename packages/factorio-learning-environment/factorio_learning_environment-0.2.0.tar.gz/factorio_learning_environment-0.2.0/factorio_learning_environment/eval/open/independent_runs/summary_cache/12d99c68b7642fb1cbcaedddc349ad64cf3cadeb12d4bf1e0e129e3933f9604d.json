{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0): Responsible for extracting iron ore. Currently out of fuel and unable to continue mining due to a full chest at drop position.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (x=-15.5, y=-48.5) and (x=-14.5, y=-48.5): Used for storing extracted iron ore and iron plates. The chest at (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) contains 2 iron ore and 9 iron plates.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0): Utilized for smelting iron ore into iron plates. Currently fueled with coal and has iron ore in its source inventory but has not produced any iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserters**:\n  - At position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5): Transfers items between the wooden chest and the furnace. Currently waiting for source items.\n  - At position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5): Transfers items between the wooden chests. Also waiting for source items.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Undefined Variables\n- Ensure all variables are defined before use. For example, the error \"NameError: name 'plate_inserter' is not defined\" suggests that the variable 'plate_inserter' was used without being defined. Verify variable names and ensure they are initialized correctly.\n\n### Errors When Extracting from Non-Existent Entities\n- Before attempting to extract items, confirm the existence of the target entity and its contents. The error \"Could not extract iron-ore from wooden-chest at (-14.5, -48.5)\" indicates an attempt to extract from a non-existent or empty entity. Regularly check the status of storage entities to ensure they contain the expected items.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Fuel\n- Regularly refuel entities that require fuel to operate, such as the burner mining drill and stone furnace. The mining drill is currently out of fuel, which halts the mining process. Ensure a steady supply of fuel to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Errors Due to Full Storage\n- Monitor storage entities like chests to prevent them from becoming full, which can halt production processes. The chest at the mining drill's drop position is full, preventing further mining. Regularly clear or expand storage to accommodate ongoing production."}
