{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) with sufficient fuel, extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chests**:\n  - Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) storing iron ore.\n  - Chest at position (x=-15.5, y=-48.5) currently empty.\n  - Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-46.5) storing iron ore.\n  - Chest at position (x=-7.5, y=-47.5) currently empty.\n- **Stone Furnaces**:\n  - Furnace at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0) producing iron plates, currently full with 100 iron plates.\n  - Furnace at position (x=-10.0, y=-48.0) producing iron plates, currently full with 100 iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserters**:\n  - Inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) waiting for source items, connected to the furnace at (x=-12.0, y=-48.0).\n  - Inserter at position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5) working, transferring items from chest at (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) to chest at (x=-14.5, y=-46.5).\n  - Inserter at position (x=-8.5, y=-47.5) waiting for source items, connected to the furnace at (x=-10.0, y=-48.0).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entities (e.g., chests or furnaces) have items available for the inserters to transfer. Regularly check and replenish the source inventory to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Space in Destination\n- Make sure that the destination entities (e.g., chests or furnaces) have enough space to accommodate items being transferred by inserters. Regularly clear or expand storage to prevent bottlenecks.\n\n### Errors with Furnaces Having No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Ensure that furnaces are continuously supplied with raw materials (e.g., iron ore) to maintain production. Monitor and refill the input inventory of furnaces as needed.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Result Being Full\n- Regularly extract produced items from furnaces to prevent them from reaching full capacity, which halts production. Implement efficient logistics to move items to storage or further processing."}
