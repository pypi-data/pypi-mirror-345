{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (42.0, -83.0) with a fuel inventory of coal and output blocked due to lack of a sink entity.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (42.5, -81.5) with a fuel inventory of coal, waiting for source items due to a full chest.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-15.0, -49.0) with a fuel inventory of coal, currently working and full of iron plates.\n\n### Transport Belt System\n- **BeltGroup** connecting from (42.5, -82.5) to (44.5, -82.5) and from (43.5, -81.5) to (43.5, -79.5), with outputs from (43.5, -80.5) to (42.5, -79.5). This belt system is empty but operational.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing transport belts\n- Ensure the intended position for placing transport belts is clear of obstructions and that the belts can connect properly to existing structures.\n\n### Errors when placing Wooden Chests\n- Verify that the intended position for placing wooden chests is not obstructed and that there is sufficient space for placement.\n\n### Errors when placing inserters\n- Confirm that the intended position for placing inserters is not occupied and that the inserter can connect to the necessary entities.\n\n### Output Blockage and Full Inventory Warnings\n- Address output blockages by ensuring there is a sink entity available to accept outputs from drills and furnaces.\n- Regularly clear full inventories to prevent production halts and ensure continuous operation."}
