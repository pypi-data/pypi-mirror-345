{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report (Updated)\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at position (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump (position: -9.5, -0.5) - working (water: 100, temp: 15\u00b0C)\n- Boiler (position: -6.0, 1.5) - now connected with pipes (50 coal remaining)\n- Steam engine (position: -1.5, 4.5) - now connected to boiler via 4 pipes\n- Pipe network (3 pipes from pump to boiler, 4 pipes from boiler to engine)\n\n### Iron Production Line at position (15.5, 70.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill (position: 15.5, 70.5) - missing (was previously present)\n- Wooden chest (position: 15.5, 72.5) - contains 38 iron ore\n- Stone furnace (position: 16.0, 74.0) - working with 48 coal, contains 21 iron plates\n- 3 Inserters (positions: 16.5,72.5; 17.5,74.5; 18.5,74.5) - all without power\n- Assembling machine 2 (position: 21.5, 74.5) - no power, missing iron plates for gear production\n- Output chest (position: 19.5, 74.5) - empty\n- Small electric poles providing power coverage (though currently not functioning)\n\n### Electricity Groups\nMultiple disconnected electricity groups detected at:\n- (30.5,32.5) with 3 poles\n- (50.5,54.5) with 1 pole\n- (100.5,104.5) with 1 pole\n- (150.5,154.5) with 2 poles\n- (200.5,204.5) with 1 pole\n- (300.5,300.5) with 2 poles\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Placement Errors (18 total instances)\n- Occupied tiles: Verify tile is empty before placing (occurred at (0.0,0.0), (25.5,69.5), (30.5,32.5))\n- Water placement: Check terrain type before placing (electric mining drills in water at (398.5,400.5))\n- Distance limitations: Move within 10 tiles before placing (occurred at (18.0,74.0) and (28.5,30.5))\n\n### Power System Issues\n- Boiler fuel depletion: Now at 50 coal remaining (improved from 48)\n- Electrical network: Steam engine now connected but still not producing power\n- Production halted: All electric devices remain without power\n\n### Entity Access Errors\n- Missing entities: Verify entity exists before accessing (electric mining drill at (15.5,70.5) disappeared)\n- Invalid object types: Ensure correct object type is passed to functions (Inventory object passed where Entity expected)\n\n### Movement and Pathfinding Errors\n- Pathfinding failures: Unable to calculate path from (401.5,400.5) to (601.0,600.5)\n- Invalid movement: String index error persists when attempting to move\n\n### Production Chain Issues\n- Iron ore backlog: Chest at (15.5,72.5) still full with 38 ore\n- Assembler starvation: No progress on gear production\n- Resource imbalance: 21 iron plates now accumulated in furnace\n\n### Code Execution Errors\n- Assertion failures: Area clearing assertions failing due to uncleared entities\n- Connection validation: Fluid connections between boiler and steam engine now established\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `find_empty_position()` -> Position: Still failing due to uncleared areas\n- `clear_area(position: Position, radius: float)` -> bool: Assertion failures persist\n\n### Important Variables\n- `entities_remaining: List[Entity]` - Still tracking uncleared entities\n- `empty_pos: Position` - Still storing found empty positions (when successful)"}
