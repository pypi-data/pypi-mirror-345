{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-3.5, 27.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-3.5, 27.5)\n- Boiler at position (-5.5, 25.0)\n- Steam Engine at position (-0.5, 25.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting offshore pump to boiler with pipes at positions [(x=-3.5, y=25.5), (x=-3.5, y=26.5)]\n- PipeGroup connecting boiler to steam engine with pipes at positions [(x=-1.5, y=17.5), (x=1.5, y=17.5), (x=0.5, y=17.5), ..., (x=-0.5, y=28.5), (x=0.5, y=28.5), (x=1.5, y=28.5)]\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (15.0, 0.0) with coal as fuel\n- Inserter at position (17.5, 0.5) transferring items to a chest\n- Inserter at position (16.5, 0.5) transferring items from a chest\n- Wooden Chest at position (5.5, 0.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (18.5, 0.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Steam Engine and Boiler Connections\n- Ensure that the steam engine is connected to the power network and has input liquid. Check the connections between the boiler and steam engine to ensure fluid flow.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Not Receiving Power\n- Make sure that inserters are connected to a power source. Check the connections to the electric network and ensure poles are placed correctly to supply power.\n\n### Errors with Offshore Pump Connections\n- Verify that the offshore pump is correctly connected to the boiler with pipes. Ensure that the fluid system is complete and there are no breaks in the pipe connections.\n\n### Errors when Connecting Entities with Pipes\n- When connecting entities like boilers and steam engines with pipes, ensure that the correct positions are used and that the entities are within reach of each other. Check for any nil or incorrect connections.\n\n### General Tips for Entity Connections\n- Always verify the status of entities after placement to ensure they are functioning as expected. Look for warnings and address them promptly to maintain efficient operation."}
