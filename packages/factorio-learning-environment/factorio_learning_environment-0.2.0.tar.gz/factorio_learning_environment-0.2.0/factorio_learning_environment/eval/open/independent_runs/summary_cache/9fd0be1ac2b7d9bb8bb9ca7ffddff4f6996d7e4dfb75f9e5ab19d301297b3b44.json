{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Transfer Setup at Position (-13.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) with coal as fuel, extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) storing iron ore extracted by the mining drill.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -48.5) intended to transfer iron ore from the chest to the furnace but currently misaligned.\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates but not receiving ore due to inserter misalignment.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Misalignment of Inserter\n- Ensure that the inserter's pickup and drop positions are correctly aligned with the source (chest) and destination (furnace) entities. The pickup position should be aligned with the chest, and the drop position should be aligned with the furnace.\n\n### Inserter Out of Fuel\n- Regularly check and refuel inserters to prevent them from running out of fuel, which can halt operations.\n\n### Incorrect Placement of Entities\n- Before placing an entity, verify that the target tile is unoccupied to avoid placement errors. Adjust spacing or direction as needed.\n\n### Insufficient Inventory for Operations\n- Ensure sufficient resources are available in the inventory before attempting operations like refueling or inserting items."}
