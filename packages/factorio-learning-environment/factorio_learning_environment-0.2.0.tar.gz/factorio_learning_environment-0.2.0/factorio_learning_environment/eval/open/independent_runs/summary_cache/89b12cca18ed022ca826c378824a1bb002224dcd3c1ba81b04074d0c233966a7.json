{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone mine at position(-46.0, 0.0)\nConsists of \n- Burner mining drill at position(-46.0, 0.0)\n- Wooden chest at position(-45.5, 1.5)\n\n### Stone furnace at position(-43.0, 2.0)\nConsists of \n- Stone furnace at position(-43.0, 2.0)\n\n### New Stone mine at position(-47.5, 4.5)\nConsists of \n- Electric mining drill at position(-47.5, 4.5)\n- Small electric pole at position(-47.5, 6.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n* Errors when placing entities too far away\n  - Make sure to move to the target position before attempting to place an entity. \n  - The maximum distance for placing entities is 10 units.\n* Errors when crafting items without required resources or machines\n  - Ensure that you have the required resources and machines before attempting to craft an item.\n  - Stone-brick requires a furnace to be smelted.\n* Errors when crafting items that are raw resources\n  - Stone is a raw resource that must be gathered first.\n* Errors when furnace is not fueled\n  - Ensure that the furnace is fueled before attempting to smelt items.\n* Errors when chest is full\n  - Ensure that the chest is emptied before continuing to mine resources.\n* Errors when Burner Mining Drill is out of fuel\n  - Ensure that the Burner Mining Drill is fueled before continuing to mine resources.\n* Errors when researching a technology that is already researched\n  - Check the current research status before attempting to research a technology.\n* Errors when attempting to place an entity at a position occupied by another entity\n  - Ensure that the target position is clear of other entities before attempting to place an entity.\n* Errors when using non-existent technology or prototype\n  - Ensure that the technology or prototype exists before attempting to use it.\n* Errors when accessing entities that do not exist on the map\n  - Ensure that the required entities exist on the map before attempting to access them.\n  - For example, attempting to access a Steam Engine when none are present on the map will result in an error.\n* Errors when accessing an empty list\n  - Check if the list is empty before attempting to access its elements. For example, the error in step 51 occurred because the list of steam engines was empty.\n* Errors when getting an entity that does not exist at a specific position\n  - Ensure that the entity exists at the specified position before attempting to access it.\n* Errors when inserting items into a full inventory\n  - Check if the inventory is full before attempting to insert items. For example, the error in step 60 occurred because the furnace inventory was full.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\nThe following variables have been assigned:\n- `stone`: count of stone resources (type: int)\n- `stone-brick`: count of stone-brick resources (type: int)\n\nThe following function has been defined:\n- `get_entities(entities: List[Prototype]) -> List[Entity]`: Returns a list of entities on the map that match the given prototype. \n  - Failure mode: IndexError when the list is empty.\n  - Success mode: Returns a list of entities when the list is not empty. \n- `get_entity(prototype: Prototype, position: Position) -> Entity`: Returns an entity on the map that matches the given prototype and position.\n  - Failure mode: Exception when the entity does not exist at the specified position.\n- `place_entity(prototype: Prototype, position: Position) -> Entity`: Places an entity on the map at the specified position.\n  - Failure mode: Exception when the entity cannot be placed at the specified position due to an existing object in the way.\n- `insert_item(prototype: Prototype, entity: Entity, quantity: int)`: Inserts items into the specified entity.\n  - Failure mode: Exception when the entity's inventory is full."}
