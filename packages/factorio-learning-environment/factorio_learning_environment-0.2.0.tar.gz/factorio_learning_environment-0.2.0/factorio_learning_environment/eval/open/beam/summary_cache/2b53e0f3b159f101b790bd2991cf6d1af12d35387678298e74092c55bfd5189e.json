{"content": "Let me analyze what's happening:\n\n1. The drill's drop position is at (20.296875, -17.49609375)\n2. When we try to place the inserter at that exact position, it's snapping to a different position (19.5, -18.5)\n3. The drill is showing \"waiting for space in destination\" because its output at (20.5, -17.5) is blocked\n\nLet's try a different approach - using a chest as an intermediate:\n\n```python\n# First move to the drill's position\nmove_to(Position(19.0, -17.0))\nprint(\"Moved to drill position\")\n\n# Get our drill reference\ndrill = get_entities({Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill})[0]\nprint(f\"Working with drill at {drill.position}\")\nprint(f\"Drill drop position: {drill.drop_position}\")\n\n# Place a chest at the drill's drop position\nchest = place_entity(\n    Prototype.WoodenChest,\n    position=Position(x=20.5, y=-17.5)  # Rounded from drill's drop position\n)\nprint(f\"Placed chest at {chest.position}\")\n\n# Place furnace with proper spacing\nfurnace = place_entity(\n    Prototype.StoneFurnace,\n    position=Position(22.5, -17.5)  # 2 tiles right of chest\n)\nprint(f\"Placed furnace at {furnace.position}\")\n\n# Place inserter between chest and furnace\ninserter = place_entity(\n    Prototype.BurnerInserter,\n    position=Position(21.5, -17.5)  # Between chest and furnace\n)\nrotate_entity(inserter, Direction.RIGHT)\nprint(f\"Placed inserter at {inserter.position}\")\n\n# Add fuel to all machines\ninsert_item(Prototype.Coal, drill, quantity=5)\ninsert_item(Prototype.Coal, inserter, quantity=1)\ninsert_item(Prototype.Coal, furnace, quantity=5)\nprint(\"Added fuel to all machines\")\n\n# Let system work\nprint(\"Waiting for system to process ore...\")\nsleep(10)\n\n# Check final status\nprint(f\"Final status:\")\nprint(f\"Drill status: {drill.status}\")\nprint(f\"Chest inventory: {inspect_inventory(chest)}\")\nprint(f\"Inserter status: {inserter.status}\")\nprint(f\"Furnace status: {furnace.status}\")\nprint(f\"Furnace inventory: {inspect_inventory(furnace)}\")\n```\n\nThis approach should work better because:\n1. The chest can collect items from the drill's output\n2. The inserter has clear pickup and drop positions\n3. Everything is aligned on the same y-coordinate\n4. We're using whole number coordinates that the game seems to prefer\n\nLet me know if this works better!", "summary_range": "[1-3354]"}
