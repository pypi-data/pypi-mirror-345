{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nNo structures have been successfully created on the map as all placement attempts have failed.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when moving to positions\n- Ensure that the 'Position' object is used correctly. The error \"'Position' object is not callable\" suggests that there might be an attempt to use 'Position' as a function. Verify the syntax and ensure 'Position' is being used as an object with attributes.\n- When moving to a new position, ensure that the indices used are integers. The error \"Cannot move. string indices must be integers, not 'str'\" indicates incorrect index usage.\n\n### Errors when requesting path\n- Ensure that the path request parameters are correctly set. The error \"Could not get path from x=199.5 y=199.5 to x=400.5 y=400.0\" suggests a problem with the pathfinding request. Verify the start and goal positions are valid and reachable.\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Verify that the target tile for placing an entity is not already occupied. The repeated errors such as \"Cannot place Wooden Chest at x=0.0 y=0.0\" indicate that the placement location might be invalid or occupied.\n- Ensure that the coordinates for placing entities are within the valid map boundaries and are not overlapping with other entities or obstacles.\n- Consider checking the inventory to ensure that the required items for placement are available and that the placement logic aligns with the game rules."}
