{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=-5.5, y=24.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Boiler** at position (x=-5.5, y=24.0) with status 'NO_FUEL'\n- **Steam Engine** at position (x=-1.5, y=24.5) with status 'NOT_CONNECTED'\n- **Offshore Pump** at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5) with status 'WORKING'\n- **Pipe Group** connecting the boiler, steam engine, and offshore pump, with fluid system ID 67420\n\n### Lab at Position (x=6.5, y=-57.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Lab** at position (x=6.5, y=-57.5) with status 'NO_POWER'\n  - Contains 10 Automation Science Packs\n\n### Copper Plate Furnace at Position (x=6.0, y=-62.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnace** at position (x=6.0, y=-62.0) with status 'NO_INGREDIENTS'\n  - Contains 50 Copper Plates\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Undefined Entities\n- Ensure that all entities are correctly defined and imported before use. For example, use `entities.Lab` instead of `Lab`.\n\n### Errors Related to Power Supply\n- Ensure that all entities requiring power are connected to a power source. The lab at position (x=6.5, y=-57.5) is not receiving power, which can be resolved by connecting it to an active power network.\n\n### Errors Related to Fuel Supply\n- Ensure that boilers and other fuel-dependent entities are supplied with the necessary fuel to function. The boiler at position (x=-5.5, y=24.0) is out of fuel, which needs to be addressed to generate electricity.\n\n### Errors Related to Connection of Entities\n- Verify that all entities are properly connected to the necessary networks, such as power and fluid networks. The steam engine at position (x=-1.5, y=24.5) is not connected to the power network, which should be resolved to ensure functionality."}
