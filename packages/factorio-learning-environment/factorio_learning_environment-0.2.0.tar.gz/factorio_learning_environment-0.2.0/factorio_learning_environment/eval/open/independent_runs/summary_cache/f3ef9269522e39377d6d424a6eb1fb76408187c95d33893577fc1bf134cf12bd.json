{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) extracting iron ore, refueled with coal.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0) producing iron plates, currently full with 100 iron plates.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-10.0, y=-48.0) producing iron plates, currently with 55 iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) transferring iron ore from a chest to the furnace at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0), waiting for space in destination.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5) transferring items between chests, waiting for source items.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-8.5, y=-47.5) transferring iron plates from the furnace at position (x=-10.0, y=-48.0) to a chest, waiting for space in destination.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (x=-14.5, y=-48.5), (x=-15.5, y=-48.5), (x=-14.5, y=-46.5), (x=-7.5, y=-47.5), and (x=-6.5, y=-47.5) for storage of materials and products.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Space in Destination\n- Ensure that the destination for the inserter is not full before attempting to transfer items. Consider adding more storage or using the items in the destination to free up space.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Verify that the source for the inserter has items available to transfer. Ensure that the supply chain is continuous and that resources are being fed into the system adequately.\n\n### Errors when Inserting Items with Insufficient Inventory\n- Before attempting to insert items into an entity, confirm that you have the necessary items in your inventory. Regularly check and manage your inventory to ensure you have the required resources for operations."}
