{"content": "The repeated issue of not seeing any output between the start and end diagnostics messages suggests that the script is not executing as expected. Here are some potential reasons and troubleshooting steps:\n\n1. **Output Suppression**: Ensure that the environment is configured to display print statements. If the environment suppresses output, you won't see any intermediate results.\n\n2. **Entity Retrieval**: The `get_entities` function might not be retrieving any entities, or it might not be functioning as expected. If the entities are not found, the assertions should trigger an exception, but if they are found and not being printed, there might be an issue with how the print statements are executed.\n\n3. **Print Statements**: Verify that the print statements are correctly placed and that they are not being skipped due to conditional logic. You can add additional print statements to confirm the flow of execution.\n\n4. **Functionality of `move_to`, `inspect_inventory`, and `connect_entities`**: Ensure these functions are working as expected. If they fail silently, they might not produce any output.\n\n5. **Environment Logs**: Check if there are any logs or console outputs in the environment that might provide additional context or errors that aren't being caught by the script.\n\n6. **Debugging**: Add more granular print statements to trace the execution path and identify where the output might be getting lost.\n\nHere's a revised approach with additional debug statements:\n\n```python\nprint(\"Begin System Diagnostics\")\n\ntry:\n    print(\"Retrieving entities...\")\n    offshore_pump_list = get_entities({Prototype.OffshorePump})\n    boiler_list = get_entities({Prototype.Boiler})\n    steam_engine_list = get_entities({Prototype.SteamEngine})\n    electric_pole_list = get_entities({Prototype.SmallElectricPole})\n    assembling_machine_list = get_entities({Prototype.AssemblingMachine1})\n\n    # Log the number of each entity found\n    print(f\"Offshore Pumps Found: {len(offshore_pump_list)}\")\n    print(f\"Boilers Found: {len(boiler_list)}\")\n    print(f\"Steam Engines Found: {len(steam_engine_list)}\")\n    print(f\"Electric Poles Found: {len(electric_pole_list)}\")\n    print(f\"Assembling Machines Found: {len(assembling_machine_list)}\")\n\n    # Assert presence of all required entities\n    assert offshore_pump_list, \"Offshore Pump not found!\"\n    assert boiler_list, \"Boiler not found!\"\n    assert steam_engine_list, \"Steam Engine not found!\"\n    assert electric_pole_list, \"Electric Pole not found!\"\n    assert assembling_machine_list, \"Assembling Machine not found!\"\n\n    print(\"All necessary entities are present.\")\n\n    # Assign first entity in the list to variables\n    offshore_pump = offshore_pump_list[0]\n    boiler = boiler_list[0]\n    steam_engine = steam_engine_list[0]\n    electric_pole = electric_pole_list[0]\n    assembling_machine = assembling_machine_list[0]\n    print(\"Entity assignments completed.\")\n\n    # Move to each entity's position, logging action\n    print(f\"Moving to Boiler position at {boiler.position}.\")\n    move_to(boiler.position)\n\n    # Inspect and refuel the boiler if needed\n    print(\"Inspecting boiler coal level...\")\n    current_coal = inspect_inventory(boiler).get(Prototype.Coal, 0)\n    print(f\"Boiler initial coal level: {current_coal}\")\n    if current_coal < 5:\n        insert_item(Prototype.Coal, boiler, 10 - current_coal)\n        new_coal_level = inspect_inventory(boiler).get(Prototype.Coal, 0)\n        print(f\"Boiler refueled.
