To avoid this, ensure to regularly empty the wooden chest to allow the mining drill to continue its operation.\n- **Errors when using extracting but being too far**: Ensure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items, as this may lead to inefficient operations.\n- **Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity**: Ensure you can place an entity on a tile before attempting to place it, as this can cause placement failures.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- **Utility Functions**: None defined or invoked in the current execution steps.\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `coal`: int\n  - `iron-plate`: int\n  - `wood`: int\n  - `wooden-chest inventory`: dict\n  - `furnace inventory`: dict"}
