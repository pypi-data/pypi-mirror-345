{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Ore Mining Site at Position (-23.0, -68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0)\n- Transport Belts connecting to a Wooden Chest at position (-23.5, -69.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (-23.5, -69.5) storing copper ore\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Site at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0)\n- Transport Belts connecting to a Wooden Chest at position (-12.5, -54.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (-12.5, -54.5) storing iron ore\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-18.0, -70.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-18.0, -70.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -70.0)\n- Transport Belts connecting the furnaces with a Burner Inserter at position (-20.5, -66.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Storage Facility at Position (-16.5, -64.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (-16.5, -64.5) storing iron plates\n- Burner Inserter at position (-17.5, -64.5) transferring items into the chest\n\n### Coal Mining Site at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5) storing coal\n\n### Miscellaneous Storage at Position (1.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5) storing various items\n- Burner Inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) transferring items between chests\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Non-Functional Belts\n- Ensure all belts are properly connected to form a continuous path for items to travel. Check connections at positions such as (-25.5, -70.5), (-24.5, -70.5), and others.\n\n### Errors with Full Inventory\n- Before attempting to insert items into an entity, check if there is available space. For example, the burner-inserter at position (-20.5, -66.5) had a full inventory, preventing further insertion.\n\n### Errors with Missing Ingredients\n- Ensure that all furnaces have the necessary ingredients to operate. The furnace at position (-18.0, -70.0) was missing ingredients, halting production.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Check that the source entity for inserters has items available for transfer. The burner-inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) was waiting for source items, indicating a potential supply issue."}
