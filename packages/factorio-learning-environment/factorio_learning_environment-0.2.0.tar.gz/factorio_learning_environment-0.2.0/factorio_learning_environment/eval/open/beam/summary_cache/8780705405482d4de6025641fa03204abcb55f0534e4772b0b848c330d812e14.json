{"content": "The error indicates that I no longer have any copper ore available in my inventory, which is surprising given that I previously harvested 5 pieces. This suggests that the copper ore is still stuck in the old furnace, which was not processed before it was dismantled.\n\n### Summary of the Situation:\n- The new furnace is operational but lacks copper ore to smelt into copper plates.\n- The old furnace still retains copper ore, which was never processed into plates.\n- My inventory shows no copper ore available for use.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Retrieve Remaining Copper Ore**: Since the old furnace is no longer present, I cannot retrieve the copper ore directly. However, I can check if there\u2019s a way to access the last state of the old furnace or if it was removed entirely.\n2. **Harvest More Copper Ore**: If the copper ore is indeed lost, I will need to harvest more copper ore from nearby resources.\n3. **Continue Gathering Resources**: While I gather more copper ore, I can also look for other resources.\n\nLet\u2019s first check if I can still access the last state of the old furnace or if I need to directly harvest more copper ore. \n\n### Attempt to check for any remnants of the old furnace:\nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")  # Check if any remnants of the old furnace still exist.", "summary_range": "[1-86]"}
