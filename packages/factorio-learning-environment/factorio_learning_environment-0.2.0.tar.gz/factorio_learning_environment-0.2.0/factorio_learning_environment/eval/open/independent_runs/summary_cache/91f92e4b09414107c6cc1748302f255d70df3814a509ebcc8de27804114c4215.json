{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Coal mining drill at position (41, -82)\nConsists of a burner-mining-drill at position (41, -82), a wooden-chest at position (40.5, -83.5), and another wooden-chest at position (41.5, -83.5). The burner-mining-drill is connected to the wooden-chest at position (40.5, -83.5) for dropping resources.\n\n### Coal transportation system\nConsists of a burner-inserter at position (39.5, -81.5) that picks up resources from the wooden-chest at position (40.5, -83.5) and drops them at position (39.5, -80.5).\n\n### Furnace at position (0, 0)\nConsists of a stone-furnace at position (0, 0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n* Errors when inserting coal into a full burner-mining-drill:\n\t+ Ensure the burner-mining-drill's inventory is not full before attempting to insert coal.\n\t+ Empty the chest at the drop position to continue mining.\n* Errors when extracting coal from a chest:\n\t+ Ensure the chest is not empty before attempting to extract coal.\n* Errors when using a burner-inserter:\n\t+ Ensure the source chest is not empty and the inserter has a valid pickup position.\n* Errors when using a furnace:\n\t+ Ensure the furnace has ingredients to smelt and the fuel source is not full.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n* Important variables:\n\t+ `coal_chest`: a wooden-chest at position (40.5, -83.5) containing coal.\n\t+ `iron_chest`: a wooden-chest at position (41.5, -83.5) containing coal.\n\t+ `drill`: a burner-mining-drill at position (41, -82).\n\t+ `inserter`: a burner-inserter at position (39.5, -81.5).\n\t+ `furnace`: a stone-furnace at position (0, 0).\n* Utility functions:\n\t+ `insert_item`: inserts an item into an entity's inventory.\n\t+ `extract_item`: extracts an item from an entity's inventory.\n\t+ Failure modes:\n\t\t- Inserting into a full inventory.\n\t\t- Extracting from an empty inventory.\n\t+ Success modes:\n\t\t- Successfully inserting or extracting an item."}
