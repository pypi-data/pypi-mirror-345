{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-10.5, 25.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (-1.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe connections between the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Furnace at Position (-19.0, -73.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n- Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n- Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n\n### Storage and Transfer System\nConsists of:\n- Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5)\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) not receiving electricity\n- Wooden Chest at Position (6.5, -59.5) containing iron plates\n\n### Laboratory Setup\nConsists of:\n- Lab with automation science packs, currently not receiving power\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of:\n- Multiple small electric poles connecting various entities, but currently not providing power\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Electricity Poles\n- Ensure that electricity poles are within range and correctly aligned to connect them successfully. Verify that the poles are not overlapping with other entities and that they are part of the same electricity network.\n\n### Steam Engine Not Generating Power\n- Check that the steam engine is properly connected to a functioning boiler and that the boiler is receiving water from the offshore pump. Ensure that the entire setup is correctly aligned and that there are no missing connections or misplaced pipes.\n\n### Inserter Not Receiving Electricity\n- Verify that the inserter is connected to a powered electric pole. Check the electricity network for any disconnections or issues preventing the flow of electricity to the inserter."}
