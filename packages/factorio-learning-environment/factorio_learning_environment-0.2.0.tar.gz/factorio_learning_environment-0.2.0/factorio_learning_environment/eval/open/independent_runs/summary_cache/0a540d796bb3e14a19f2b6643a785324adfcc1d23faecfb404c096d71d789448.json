{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report (Updated)\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator Complex at positions (-9.5,-0.5) to (-4.5,0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, -0.5) (NOT_CONNECTED)\n- Additional offshore pump at (-9.5, 1.5) (NOT_CONNECTED)\n- Boiler at (-7.5, 0.0) (NOT_CONNECTED, contains coal)\n- Steam engine at (-4.5, 0.5) (NOT_CONNECTED)\n- Multiple failed pipe connection attempts between components\n\n### Iron Production Facility at position (15.5, 70.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill at (15.5, 70.5) (NO_POWER)\n- Wooden chest at (15.5, 72.5) containing 99 iron ore\n- Inserter at (16.5, 72.5) (NO_POWER)\n- Inserter at (19.5, 73.5) (NO_POWER)\n- Small electric poles throughout the area (voltage: 0)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Persistent power system issues\n- ElectricityGroup attribute access errors (use correct properties like 'voltage' instead of 'energy')\n- Power network remains unpowered despite multiple attempts\n- Verify all power pole connections form a complete network\n\n### Entity placement distance errors (critical)\n- Repeated attempts to place entities from 75+ tiles away\n- Always move within 10 tiles before placement operations\n- Implement distance checks before placement attempts\n\n### Fluid system connection failures\n- Multiple pipe connection failures between offshore pumps and boiler\n- Verify connection points are unobstructed and properly aligned\n- Consider using underground pipes for longer distances\n\n### Entity collision errors (persistent)\n- Attempted to place pipes/boilers where entities already exist\n- Always scan target area before placement\n- Remove existing entities before rebuilding\n\n### Invalid position errors\n- Attempted to place offshore pump at invalid coordinates (300,300)\n- Verify positions are within valid map bounds\n- Check terrain type before placement (water for offshore pumps)\n\n### Movement system errors\n- Invalid movement command syntax\n- Verify movement coordinates are properly formatted numbers\n\n### Power network verification\n- Assembling machine and mining drills remain without power\n- Ensure all production buildings are connected to powered poles\n- Monitor electricity group voltage levels\n\n### Fluid system monitoring\n- All generator components remain disconnected\n- Verify fluid flow directionality in pipe connections\n- Maintain coal supply to boiler once operational"}
