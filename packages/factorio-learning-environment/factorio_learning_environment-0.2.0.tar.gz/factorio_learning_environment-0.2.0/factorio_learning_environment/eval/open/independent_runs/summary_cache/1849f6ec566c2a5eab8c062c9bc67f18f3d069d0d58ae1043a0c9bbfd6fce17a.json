{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-2.5, 25.0)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-7.5, 25.5)\n- Boiler at position (-2.5, 25.0)\n- Pipe connections between the offshore pump and the boiler:\n  - Pipes at positions (-6.5, 24.5), (-7.5, 24.5), (-4.5, 25.5), (-4.5, 24.5), (-5.5, 24.5)\n- Electricity poles forming an Electricity Group with poles at positions including (-7.5, 22.5), (-6.5, 22.5), (-4.5, 22.5), ..., (-8.5, 22.5)\n\n### Pipe Network\n- PipeGroup at position (-12.5, 21.5) with pipes at positions (-12.5, 21.5), (-11.5, 21.5), (-10.5, 23.5), (-10.5, 22.5), (-11.5, 22.5), (-9.5, 23.5), currently empty.\n\n### Furnace Setup\n- Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with coal fuel and iron-plate production.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Finding and Placing Offshore Pumps\n- Ensure the target water source is accessible and the position for the offshore pump is valid. Avoid positions that are too far from the water or already occupied.\n\n### Errors when Placing Boilers\n- Ensure the position for the boiler is valid and not obstructed by other entities. Verify that the height and width inputs are integers and correctly formatted.\n\n### Errors in Connecting Pipes\n- Verify that the connections between pipes and other entities like offshore pumps and boilers are valid. Ensure that the PipeGroup object is used correctly and is subscriptable.\n\n### General API Misuse\n- Avoid using non-integer indices for string operations and ensure that all callable objects are correctly instantiated before use."}
