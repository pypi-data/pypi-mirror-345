{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron plate production setup at position around (16.0, 71.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (16.0, 71.0) facing down, extracting iron ore from the nearby patch\n- Stone furnace at position (16.0, 73.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates\n- Wooden chest at position (17.5, 73.5) to collect iron plates from the furnace output\n- Burner inserter at position (16.5, 74.5) facing down, moving iron ore from the mining drill to the furnace\n- Burner inserter at position (18.5, 73.5) facing right, moving iron plates from the furnace to the wooden chest\n\nThis structure forms a connected production chain for iron plates, with fuel (coal) inserted into the drill, furnace, and inserters to keep them operational.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors placing inserters due to occupied tile\n- When placing an inserter next to another entity (e.g., wooden chest), ensure the target tile is free. If occupied, increase spacing, change the direction, or adjust the reference position to avoid placement conflicts.\n\n### Fuel management errors causing production stoppage\n- Multiple entities (burner mining drill, furnace, inserters) ran out of fuel causing them to stop working.\n- Always verify fuel insertion into all fuel-consuming entities in the production chain to maintain continuous operation.\n- Implement checks to confirm fuel levels before attempting extraction or insertion actions.\n\n### Inserter waiting for source items or waiting for space in destination\n- Inserters may wait if source inventories are empty or destination inventories are full.\n- Monitor inventories of chests and furnaces to prevent bottlenecks.\n- Ensure the output chest has capacity to receive items to avoid inserter blockage.\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nNo user-defined functions have been defined by the agent yet."}
