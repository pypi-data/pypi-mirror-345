{"content": "I'll create a new report based on the provided execution logs.\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage System (around position 41,-82)\n- Burner mining drill (41.0, -82.0) mining coal\n- Connected to multiple storage chests:\n  - Iron chest (41.5, -84.5) storing coal (1600)\n  - Iron chest (41.5, -83.5) storing coal (1600)\n  - Wooden chest (41.5, -80.5) storing coal (800)\n\n### Coal Transport System (around position 42,-81)\n- Transport belt system:\n  - First belt (42.5, -81.5)\n  - Second belt (43.5, -81.5)\n- Burner inserter (42.5, -80.5) for moving items from chest to belt\n\n### Smelting Area (around position 45,-81)\n- Two stone furnaces:\n  - First furnace (45.0, -81.0)\n  - Second furnace (47.0, -81.0)\n  - Both fueled with coal (50 each)\n- Storage chest (wooden) at (49.5, -80.5) containing iron plates (1500)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Collision Errors\n- Before placing entities, ensure the target location is clear of other objects\n- Check for overlapping entity footprints, especially with larger entities like furnaces and mining drills\n- Consider the full size of entities when planning layouts (e.g., mining drills are 2x2, furnaces are 2x2)\n\n### Resource Management Issues\n- Monitor chest capacity - multiple chests are showing \"chest is full\" warnings\n- Implement better chest management to prevent production stoppage due to full storage\n- Consider adding overflow protection or additional storage solutions\n\n### Production Flow Issues\n- Mining drill is waiting for space in destination chest\n- Inserters are waiting for source items indicating potential belt/logistics issues\n- Furnaces have no ingredients despite having fuel, suggesting transport chain problems\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nFunctions:\n- `place_entity()`: Places entities on the map. Fails when target location is occupied.\n\nImportant Variables:\n- `chest_inserter`: BurnerInserter type\n- `furnace_inserter`: BurnerInserter type\n- `first_belt`, `second_belt`: TransportBelt type\n- `mining_drill`: BurnerMiningDrill type\n\nStatus Variables:\n- EntityStatus.WORKING: Entity is operating normally\n- EntityStatus.WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION: Entity cannot output due to full destination\n- EntityStatus.WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS: Entity is waiting for input materials\n- EntityStatus.NO_INGREDIENTS: Entity lacks required materials for operation\n- EntityStatus.NORMAL: Entity is in normal state\n- EntityStatus.EMPTY: Entity contains no items"}
