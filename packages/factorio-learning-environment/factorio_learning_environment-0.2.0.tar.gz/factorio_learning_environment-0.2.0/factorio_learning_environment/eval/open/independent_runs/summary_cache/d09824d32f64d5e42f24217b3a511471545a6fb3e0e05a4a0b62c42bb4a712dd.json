{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) with a drop chest at position (-14.5, -48.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0) connected to the mining drill\n- Iron Chests at positions (-16.5, -48.5), (-15.5, -48.5), and (-13.5, -49.5) for ore storage\n- Wooden Chests at positions (-14.5, -48.5) and (-12.5, -49.5) for additional storage\n\n### Iron Plate Smelting Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnaces at positions (-13.0, -48.0), (-11.0, -48.0), and (-9.0, -48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates\n- Iron Chests at positions (-13.5, -49.5) and (-14.5, -47.5) for storing iron plates\n- Wooden Chest at position (-9.5, -49.5) for additional storage\n\n### Coal Storage and Distribution System at Position (47.5, -80.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Iron Chests at positions (41.5, -80.5), (42.5, -80.5), (44.5, -80.5), (45.5, -80.5), (47.5, -80.5), and (49.5, -80.5) for storing coal\n- Burner Inserters at positions (43.5, -80.5) and (41.5, -78.5) for transferring coal between chests\n- Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -79.5) for additional storage\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Fuel Management\n- Ensure all inserters have sufficient fuel to operate. Check fuel levels regularly and refuel as necessary to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Errors with Full Storage Chests\n- Regularly check and clear storage chests to prevent overflow. Full chests can halt production processes, so ensure there is always space for new items.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Refueling\n- Monitor fuel levels in furnaces to ensure continuous smelting. Refuel furnaces before they run out of fuel to avoid production delays.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Operation\n- Ensure inserters are correctly positioned and have access to both source and destination entities. Check that inserters are not blocked and have clear paths for item transfer."}
