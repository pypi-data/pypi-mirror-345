Check the fuel status and replenish as necessary.\n\n- **Errors when the Burner Inserter is waiting for source items**\n  - Verify that the source (e.g., wooden chest) has enough items available for the inserter to pick up. If the source is empty, refill it before attempting to use the inserter.\n\n- **Errors when the Stone Furnace is reported as 'NO_FUEL'**\n  - Ensure that the Stone Furnace has sufficient fuel to operate. Insert fuel items into the furnace to avoid it being idle.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions Defined:**\n  - No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the current execution steps.\n\n- **Important Variables Assigned:**\n  - `burner_mining_drill_status: EntityStatus` - Represents the status of the burner mining drill.\n  - `burner_inserter_status: EntityStatus` - Represents the status of the burner inserter.\n  - `wooden_chest_inventory: dict` - Represents the inventory of the wooden chest.\n  - `stone_furnace_status: EntityStatus` - Represents the status of the stone furnace."}
