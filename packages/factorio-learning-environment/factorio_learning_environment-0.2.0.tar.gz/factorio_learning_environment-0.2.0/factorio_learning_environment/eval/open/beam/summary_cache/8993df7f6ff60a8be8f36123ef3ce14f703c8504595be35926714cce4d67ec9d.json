{"content": "It appears that the script is consistently outputting only the initial message, \"Starting detailed diagnostic procedure...\", without progressing further. This suggests that the script might be encountering an issue very early in its execution, possibly within the entity retrieval process or due to an unhandled exception that prevents further output.\n\nHere are some steps and strategies to diagnose and resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Verify Entity Retrieval**: Ensure that the `get_entities` function is correctly implemented and that the entities exist in the game world. If the entities are not being retrieved, the script will not proceed past the initial checks.\n\n2. **Add Debugging Statements**: Place print statements immediately after each `get_entities` call to verify whether entities are being retrieved. This will help identify which specific entity retrieval is failing.\n\n3. **Check for Exceptions**: Ensure that any exceptions are being caught and printed. If an exception occurs before the assertions, it might not be visible in the output. Double-check the exception handling block to ensure it captures and prints any errors.\n\n4. **Test Environment Setup**: Confirm that your Factorio environment is set up correctly with all necessary entities placed and accessible. If the environment is not set up correctly, the entities might not be found.\n\n5. **Logging and Assertions**: Temporarily comment out the assertions to see if the script progresses further, which will help identify if the issue is with missing entities or elsewhere.\n\nHere\u2019s a refined version of the script with additional debugging prints:\n\n```python\nprint(\"Starting detailed diagnostic procedure...\")\n\ntry:\n    # Attempt to retrieve entities with detailed logging\n    print(\"Retrieving entities...\")\n    offshore_pumps = get_entities({Prototype.OffshorePump})\n    print(f\"Offshore Pumps: {offshore_pumps}\")\n\n    boilers = get_entities({Prototype.Boiler})\n    print(f\"Boilers: {boilers}\")\n\n    steam_engines = get_entities({Prototype.SteamEngine})\n    print(f\"Steam Engines: {steam_engines}\")\n\n    electric_poles = get_entities({Prototype.SmallElectricPole})\n    print(f\"Electric Poles: {electric_poles}\")\n\n    assembling_machines = get_entities({Prototype.AssemblingMachine1})\n    print(f\"Assembling Machines: {assembling_machines}\")\n\n    # Check for presence of entities\n    missing_entities = []\n    if not offshore_pumps:\n        missing_entities.append(\"Offshore Pump\")\n    if not boilers:\n        missing_entities.append(\"Boiler\")\n    if not steam_engines:\n        missing_entities.append(\"Steam Engine\")\n    if not electric_poles:\n        missing_entities.append(\"Electric Pole\")\n    if not assembling_machines:\n        missing_entities.append(\"Assembling Machine\")\n\n    if missing_entities:\n        raise AssertionError(f\"Missing Entities: {', '.join(missing_entities)}\")\n\n    print(\"All necessary entities are present.
