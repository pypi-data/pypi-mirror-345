{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining Complex at position(x=35-41, y=-83 to -87)\nComplex mining setup consisting of:\n- 4 Burner mining drills at positions (41.0,-86.0), (37.0,-85.0), (39.0,-85.0), (41.0,-83.0)\n- 4 Wooden chests collecting coal at positions (40.5,-87.5), (36.5,-86.5), (39.5,-83.5), (34.5,-86.5)\n- 2 Burner inserters at positions (35.5,-86.5) and (35.5,-85.5) moving coal between chests\n\n### Iron/Copper Ore Processing at position(x=-28, y=-61)\nMining and smelting setup consisting of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-28.0,-61.0) extracting iron and copper ore\n- Stone furnace at (-27.0,-58.0) for smelting\n- Wooden chest at (-27.5,-59.5) collecting ore\n- 2 Burner inserters at (-26.5,-59.5) and (-25.5,-58.5) moving materials\n- Output chest at (-24.5,-58.5) collecting plates\n\n### Smelting Array at position(x=0-6, y=0)\nLarge smelting setup with:\n- 4 Stone furnaces at positions (0.0,0.0), (2.0,0.0), (4.0,0.0), (6.0,0.0)\n- Input chests at (0.5,-2.5), (2.5,-2.5), (4.5,-2.5), (6.5,-2.5)\n- Output chests at (0.5,2.5), (2.5,2.5), (4.5,2.5), (6.5,2.5)\n- Multiple burner inserters moving materials between chests and furnaces\n\n### Power Generation at position(x=-3.5 to 4.5, y=17-27)\nPower setup consisting of:\n- Offshore pump at (-3.5,27.5)\n- Boiler at (-1.5,22.0)\n- Steam engine at (4.5,20.5)\n- Connected by pipe network\n- Electric poles distributing power\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when trying to extract from invalid locations\n- Verify that the target position contains extractable resources before attempting extraction\n- Move within range of the resource before attempting to extract\n\n### Entity fuel management issues\n- Multiple burner mining drills are out of fuel - implement proper fuel distribution system\n- Ensure inserters maintain fuel levels in burner devices\n\n### Chest capacity issues\n- Chest at (-5.5,-55.5) is full - implement better output handling\n- Monitor chest capacities and empty them before they block production\n\n### Fluid system connectivity issues\n- Steam engine has no input liquid - ensure proper pipe connections\n- Verify fluid system connectivity between boiler and steam engine"}
