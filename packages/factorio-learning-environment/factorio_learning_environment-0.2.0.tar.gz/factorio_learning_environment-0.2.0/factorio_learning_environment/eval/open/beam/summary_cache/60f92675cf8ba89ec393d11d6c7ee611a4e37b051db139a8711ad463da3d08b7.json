{"content": "The attempt to insert iron ore into the furnace failed because there are no iron ore pieces available in my inventory. This indicates that the previous attempts to extract or harvest iron ore were unsuccessful, and I currently have no means to produce more iron plates.\n\n### Current Inventory Overview:\n- 4 pieces of stone furnaces\n- **8 pieces of iron plates** (available)\n- **18 pieces of copper cables**\n- **13 pieces of Iron Gear Wheels**\n\n### Current Situation:\n- The furnace is unable to process any iron ore since it is not present in the inventory.\n- The Assembling Machine cannot be crafted without the necessary iron plates, which I cannot produce without iron ore.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Locate Iron Ore**: I need to find a nearby iron ore patch to gather iron ore. Since previous attempts to find iron ore were unsuccessful, I will need to move around the map to search for a valid resource patch.\n2. **Harvest Iron Ore**: Once I locate an iron ore patch, I will harvest enough iron ore to allow the furnace to produce the required iron plates.\n3. **Retry Crafting the Assembling Machine**: After obtaining iron ore and processing it into plates, I will attempt to craft the Assembling Machine again.\n\nLet's search for iron ore patches on the map and see if I can find any nearby resources to harvest.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Check for any nearby iron ore patches again\nnearby_entities = get_entities({Prototype.IronOre})\nif nearby_entities:\n    print(\"Iron ore patches found nearby:\")\n    for entity in nearby_entities:\n        print(f\" - Iron Ore Patch at Position: {entity.position}\")\nelse:\n    print(\"No iron ore patches found nearby.
