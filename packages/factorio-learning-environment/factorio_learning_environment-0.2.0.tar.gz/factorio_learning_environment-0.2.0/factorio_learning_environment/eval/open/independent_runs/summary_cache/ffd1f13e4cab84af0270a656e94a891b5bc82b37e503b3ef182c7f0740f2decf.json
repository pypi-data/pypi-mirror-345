{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Burner Mining Drill Setup at Position (41.0, -86.0)\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (41.0, -86.0) with fuel (coal: 9).\n- **Transport Belt** at position (41.5, -85.5) connected to the drill, dropping resources at (41.5, -84.5).\n\n#### Wooden Chest at Position (41.5, -79.5)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (41.5, -79.5) with an empty inventory.\n\n#### Stone Furnace at Position (-13.0, -50.0)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-13.0, -50.0) with fuel (coal: 12) but no ingredients to smelt.\n\n#### Belt Group\n- **Belt Group** with inputs at (41.5, -85.5) and outputs at (41.5, -83.5), transporting coal.\n\n---\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Ensure the target tile is clear before placing entities like **Burner Mining Drills** or **Transport Belts**. Use the `clear_entities` function to remove blocking entities before placement.\n\n#### Errors when inspecting non-existent entities\n- Verify the existence of an entity at the specified position before attempting to inspect its inventory. Use `get_entity` to confirm the entity's presence.\n\n#### Repeated placement errors\n- The agent repeatedly attempted to place entities on occupied tiles. Always check for blocking entities and clear them before placement to avoid wasting resources and time.\n\n#### Errors when placing transport belts\n- Ensure the target position for **Transport Belts** is free and aligns with the intended direction. Misaligned belts can block other entities or fail to connect properly.\n\n#### Errors when refueling or placing drills\n- Ensure the **Burner Mining Drill** is placed correctly before refueling. Misplaced drills cannot be refueled and will result in errors."}
