{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nThis facility is designed to extract and process iron ore. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore from the resource patch.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the stone furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0): Intended for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities too far from the player\n- Ensure the player is within the maximum placement distance (10 units) from the target position before attempting to place an entity. Move closer to the desired location.\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied tiles\n- Before placing an entity, verify that the target tile is unoccupied and can accommodate the new entity. Consider adjusting the spacing, direction, or reference position to avoid collisions with existing entities.\n\n### Inserter alignment and functionality issues\n- Double-check the alignment and setup of inserters to ensure they are correctly positioned to transfer items between entities. Misalignment can prevent the transfer of resources, leading to production halts.\n\n### Refueling entities\n- Regularly check and refuel entities like mining drills, furnaces, and inserters to maintain continuous operation. Lack of fuel can cause these entities to stop working.\n\n### Chest capacity management\n- Monitor the capacity of chests to prevent them from becoming full, which can halt the mining process. Regularly transfer items from chests to maintain space for incoming resources."}
