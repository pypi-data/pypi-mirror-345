{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and deposits it into a chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore, currently containing 671 units.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace. It has been repositioned multiple times to align correctly.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates but currently not receiving iron ore due to misalignment issues.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Alignment Issues\n- Ensure that the inserter's pickup and drop positions are correctly aligned with the source (chest) and destination (furnace) entities. Misalignment can prevent the transfer of materials.\n\n### Fuel Management\n- Regularly check and refuel the burner inserter and mining drill to maintain continuous operation. Consider mining more coal or redistributing existing coal to avoid running out.\n\n### Inventory Management\n- Ensure that there is sufficient coal in your inventory before attempting to refuel entities. If coal is low, prioritize harvesting or redistributing coal resources.\n\n### Furnace Input Issues\n- Verify that the furnace is receiving iron ore. If not, check the inserter setup and ensure it is correctly positioned and fueled to transfer iron ore from the chest to the furnace."}
