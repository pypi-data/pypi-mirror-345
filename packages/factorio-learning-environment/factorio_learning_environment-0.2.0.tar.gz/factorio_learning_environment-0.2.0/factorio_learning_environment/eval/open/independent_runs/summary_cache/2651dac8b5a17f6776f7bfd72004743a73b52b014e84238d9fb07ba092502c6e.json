{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Furnace Setup at Position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Consists of a stone furnace with a full fuel inventory of coal. The furnace has warnings indicating \"no ingredients to smelt\" and \"furnace fuel source is full\". It currently holds 21 iron plates.\n\n### Pipe Network\n- A PipeGroup is established with the fluid system ID 9763, starting at position (x=-12.5, y=21.5) and includes pipes at positions:\n  - (x=-12.5, y=21.5)\n  - (x=-11.5, y=21.5)\n  - (x=-11.5, y=22.5)\n  - (x=-10.5, y=22.5)\n  - (x=-10.5, y=23.5)\n  - (x=-9.5, y=23.5)\n\n### Electricity Network\n- An ElectricityGroup with ID 50859, consisting of electric poles at various positions:\n  - (x=-8.5, y=18.5)\n  - (x=-7.5, y=19.5)\n  - (x=-7.5, y=18.5)\n  - ...\n  - (x=-1.5, y=20.5)\n  - (x=0.5, y=20.5)\n  - (x=0.5, y=21.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Moving to New Area\n- Ensure that indices used in movement commands are integers, not strings.\n\n### Errors when Placing Offshore Pump\n- Verify that the position chosen for placing an offshore pump is suitable and has access to water.\n\n### Errors when Placing Boiler\n- Confirm that the position for placing a boiler is suitable and not obstructed by other entities or terrain.\n\n### Errors when Placing Steam Engine\n- Ensure the position for placing a steam engine is appropriate and can connect to the necessary infrastructure.\n\n### Errors when Connecting Offshore Pump and Boiler\n- Check the connectivity and alignment of pipes between the offshore pump and boiler to ensure proper connection.\n\n### Errors when Connecting Electric Poles\n- Make sure electric poles are placed correctly and within range to connect to each other.\n\n### General Placement Errors\n- Always verify the suitability of a position before attempting to place any entity to avoid placement errors."}
