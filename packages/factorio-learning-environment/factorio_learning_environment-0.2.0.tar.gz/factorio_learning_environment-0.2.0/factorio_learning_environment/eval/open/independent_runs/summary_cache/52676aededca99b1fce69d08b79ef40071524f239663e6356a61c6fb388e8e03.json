{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -49.0) fueled with coal, processing iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Coal Mining and Transport System at Position (42.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (42.0, -83.0) fueled with coal, extracting coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (42.5, -81.5) transferring coal from the mining drill to a transport belt.\n- Transport Belt system starting at position (43.5, -82.5) and extending to position (43.5, -79.5), facilitating the movement of coal.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure that the intended position for placing an entity is not obstructed by other objects or entities. Clear any obstructions before attempting to place a new entity.\n\n### Errors when extending transport belts\n- Verify that the path for extending transport belts is clear and that the belts are aligned correctly with existing structures to avoid placement errors.\n\n### Errors due to full output\n- Regularly check the output capacity of entities like furnaces and ensure there is sufficient space to store processed items. Consider adding additional storage or transport mechanisms to handle excess output.\n\n### Errors when using inserters with full chests\n- Ensure that chests or other storage entities connected to inserters have enough capacity to accept items. If a chest is full, the inserter will be unable to transfer items, causing a bottleneck."}
