{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron gear wheel production line at position around (16.0, 71.0) to (21.5, 73.5)\nConsists of the following connected entities forming a production chain for iron gear wheels:\n- Burner mining drill at position (16.0, 71.0) extracting iron ore, fueled by inserted coal\n- Stone furnace at position (17.0, 73.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates, fueled by inserted coal\n- Burner inserters at positions (17.5, 71.5), (19.5, 73.5), and (23.5, 73.5) moving items between mining drill, furnace, assembling machine, and chest; all fueled by inserted coal\n- Assembling machine 2 at position (21.5, 73.5) set to craft iron gear wheels from iron plates, currently unpowered\n- Wooden chest at position (18.5, 73.5) collecting iron gear wheels\n- Small electric poles at positions (19.5, 74.5) and (21.5, 75.5) intended to provide electricity connections to the assembling machine and inserters, but power delivery is incomplete or absent\n\nThis structure integrates mining, smelting, assembling, and storage within a compact area, connected by inserters and electric poles, with fuel inserted into burner entities.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to assembler not receiving power despite electric poles placed\n- Ensure that the electric poles are properly connected to a power source such as a steam engine or power grid; poles alone do not supply power.\n- Verify that the power network is active and that poles are within range of power-producing entities.\n- Check that the assembler and inserters are within the coverage radius of the electric poles.\n- Confirm that no gaps or disconnected poles exist in the power network.\n\n### Errors inserting coal into burner entities due to inventory shortages\n- Before attempting to insert coal into burner mining drills, furnaces, or burner inserters, confirm that sufficient coal is present in the inventory.\n- Harvest or acquire coal proactively to maintain a steady supply.\n- Avoid repeated insertion attempts when inventory is empty to prevent exceptions.\n\n### Errors from attempting to insert coal into inserters unnecessarily\n- Burner inserters do not require fuel insertion; only burner mining drills and furnaces need coal.\n- Avoid inserting coal into burner inserters to prevent wasted actions and errors.\n\n### Errors from repeated failed insert_item calls due to no coal in inventory\n- Implement inventory checks prior to insert_item calls to prevent exceptions.\n- Manage coal harvesting and insertion logic to maintain coal availability and avoid redundant insertion attempts.\n\n### General placement and connection error tips (from previous report)\n- Confirm target tiles are free before placing entities.\n- Use inserters to extract items from furnaces before feeding transport belts.\n- Ensure correct assembling machine types are available in inventory before placement.\n- Verify power network connectivity and energy levels regularly.\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nNo user-defined functions have been defined in the current steps."}
