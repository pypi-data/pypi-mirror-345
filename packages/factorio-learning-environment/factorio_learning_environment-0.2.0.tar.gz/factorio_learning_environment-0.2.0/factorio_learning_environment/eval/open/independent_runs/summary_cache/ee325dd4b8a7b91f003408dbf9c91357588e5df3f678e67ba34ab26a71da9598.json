{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining Setup at Position (x=53.0, y=-83.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position x=53.0, y=-83.0) connected to a Wooden Chest (position x=52.5, y=-84.5)\n\n### Copper Ore Mining Setup at Position (x=-23.0, y=-68.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position x=-23.0, y=-68.0) connected to a Wooden Chest (position x=-23.5, y=-69.5)\n- Transport Belt network connecting the mining drill to various positions\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Setup at Position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position x=-14.0, y=-53.0) connected to a Wooden Chest (position x=-14.5, y=-54.5)\n- Burner Inserter (position x=-13.5, y=-54.5) transferring items to another Wooden Chest (position x=-12.5, y=-54.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Production at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace (position x=0.0, y=0.0) with a Wooden Chest (position x=1.5, y=0.5) and a Burner Inserter (position x=2.5, y=0.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Production at Position (x=-19.0, y=-65.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace (position x=-19.0, y=-65.0) with a Burner Inserter (position x=-17.5, y=-64.5) transferring items to a Wooden Chest (position x=-16.5, y=-64.5)\n\n### Additional Iron Plate Production at Position (x=-21.0, y=-62.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace (position x=-21.0, y=-62.0) with a Wooden Chest (position x=-20.5, y=-63.5)\n\n### Transport Belt Network\nSeveral BeltGroups connecting various positions, facilitating the movement of resources across the map.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Belt Connection\n- Ensure that all belts are correctly aligned without gaps to facilitate smooth item transport. Check the belt placement at position (-21.5, y=-65.5) to resolve connection issues.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source container has items available for the inserter to pick up. Check the setup at position (x=-13.5, y=-54.5) and (x=2.5, y=0.5) to ensure items are available.\n\n### Furnace No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Check the furnaces at positions (x=-20.0, y=-70.0), (x=-18.0, y=-70.0), (x=-19.0, y=-65.0), (x=-21.0, y=-62.0), and (x=0.0, y=0.0) to ensure they are supplied with raw materials."}
