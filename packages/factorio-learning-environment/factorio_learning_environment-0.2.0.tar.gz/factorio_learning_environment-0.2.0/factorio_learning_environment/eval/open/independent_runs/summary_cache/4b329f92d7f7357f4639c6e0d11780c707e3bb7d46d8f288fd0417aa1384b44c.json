{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, -0.5)\n- Boiler at (-5.5, 0.0)\n- Steam engine at (-1.5, 0.5)\n- Connected by pipes forming a complete power generation system\n\n### Iron Mining and Smelting Operation at (15.5, 70.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill at (15.5, 70.5) extracting iron ore\n- Stone furnace at (16.0, 74.0) for smelting\n- Inserter at (15.5, 72.5) connecting the drill to furnace\n- Powered by nearby small electric poles\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Belt connection errors\n- Transport belts cannot be connected directly to furnaces - always use an inserter as intermediary\n- Ensure belt paths are valid before attempting connections - check for obstacles and proper alignment\n\n### Entity placement errors\n- Move closer than 10 tiles before placing entities - current position is too far from target\n- Check for existing entities before placing new ones - cannot place where something already exists\n\n### Mining operation issues\n- Ensure mining drills have clear output paths - blocked outputs halt production\n- Verify inserter positions correctly bridge between miners and furnaces\n\n### Power system considerations\n- Maintain proper pipe connections between offshore pumps, boilers and steam engines\n- Keep fuel supplied to boilers and furnaces for continuous operation"}
