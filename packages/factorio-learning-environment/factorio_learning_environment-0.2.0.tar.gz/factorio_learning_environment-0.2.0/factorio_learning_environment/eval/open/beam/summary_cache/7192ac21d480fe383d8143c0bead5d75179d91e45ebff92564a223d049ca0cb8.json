{"content": "It seems that the execution results are not being displayed beyond the initial print statement. This suggests that there might be an issue with how the environment is processing or displaying outputs after the first print. Here are some steps and suggestions to troubleshoot and potentially resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Environment Setup Verification**: Ensure that the Factorio REPL environment is correctly initialized and that it supports multiple print statements. Sometimes, the environment might have limitations on how many outputs it can handle at once.\n\n2. **Output Buffering**: Check if the environment is buffering outputs and not flushing them immediately. This can sometimes cause only the first output to be visible. If possible, try flushing the output buffer after each print statement.\n\n3. **Simplify the Test**: Start with a very basic script that only prints a series of numbers or simple strings to see if any output beyond the first line is captured. This can help determine if the issue is with the environment or the specific commands being used.\n\n4. **Error Handling**: Ensure that any exceptions are being caught and printed. If the environment is encountering an error after the first print, it might not be displaying subsequent outputs. The current script already includes error handling, but ensure that any exceptions are being logged correctly.\n\n5. **Environment Logs**: If the environment provides logs or a console, check there for any error messages or warnings that might indicate what's going wrong.\n\n6. **Alternative Output Methods**: If possible, try using alternative methods to capture output, such as writing to a file or using a different logging mechanism, to see if the issue is with the standard output stream.\n\nHere's a simplified version of the script to test basic output:\n\n```python\ntry:\n    # Basic diagnostic prints\n    print(\"Test 1: Initial diagnostic print.\")\n    print(\"Test 2: Second diagnostic print.\")\n    print(\"Test 3: Third diagnostic print.\")\n\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"An error occurred: {e}\")\n```\n\nRun this script to see if all three print statements appear. If they do, the issue might be related to the specific commands or functions used in the previous scripts. If only the first print appears, it suggests a more fundamental issue with the output handling in the environment.", "summary_range": "[1-380]"}
