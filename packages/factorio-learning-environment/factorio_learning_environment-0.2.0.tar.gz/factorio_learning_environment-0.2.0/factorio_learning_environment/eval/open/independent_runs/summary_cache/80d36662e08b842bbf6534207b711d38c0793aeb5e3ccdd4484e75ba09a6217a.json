{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nNo structures have been successfully created on the map as of the current steps. The logs indicate attempts to place various entities, but none have been successfully placed due to various errors and obstacles.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied or invalid tiles\n- Ensure the target tile is clear before attempting to place an entity. The logs show multiple failed placement attempts at various coordinates due to occupied positions or invalid placement conditions.\n\n### Errors with incorrect dimensions or types in code\n- Review and correct any code that involves dimensions or types, such as the `BuildingBox` error on line 3. Ensure that the types and dimensions used in the code are compatible with the expected input.\n\n### Obstacles in placement area\n- Before attempting to place entities, scan the target area for obstacles. The logs indicate numerous obstacles in a large grid area (positions x=145.0 to x=155.0 and y=145.0 to y=155.0), which prevent successful placement.\n\n### General placement errors\n- Double-check the coordinates and conditions for placing entities, as multiple attempts to place wooden chests and transport belts at various coordinates have failed. Make sure the placement logic is correctly implemented to avoid such errors."}
