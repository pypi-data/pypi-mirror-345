{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Setup at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) extracting iron ore and transferring it to a chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5) storing extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5) transferring iron ore from the chest to a furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0) intended for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Coal Refueling System\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-1.5, 0.5) intended for refueling the stone furnace with coal.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Misalignment of Inserters\n- Ensure that inserters are correctly aligned with their intended pickup and drop positions. Frequent repositioning of inserters suggests initial misalignment. Double-check the inserter's pickup and drop positions to ensure they match the intended source and destination.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Iron Ore\n- Verify that the inserter transferring iron ore to the furnace is properly configured and operational. Ensure that the inserter's drop position aligns with the furnace's input.\n\n### Insufficient Inventory for Refueling\n- Before attempting to refuel entities, confirm that you have sufficient fuel (e.g., coal) in your inventory. This will prevent errors related to inserting items when the inventory is empty.\n\n### Errors when Using Extracting but Being Too Far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items. This will prevent errors related to being out of range.\n\n### Errors when Placing into a Tile Occupied by Another Entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity on a tile before attempting placement. Avoid overlapping entities unless intentional."}
