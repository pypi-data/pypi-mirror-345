{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) connected to a Stone Furnace at position (41.0, -80.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (43.5, -79.5) for storage\n\n### Iron Plate Mine at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5)\n\n### Copper Furnace at Position (-20.0, -71.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -71.0)\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors due to Lack of Fuel\n- Ensure that all burner mining drills and furnaces are adequately fueled to avoid production halts. Regularly check fuel levels and replenish as necessary.\n\n### Errors due to No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Verify that furnaces have the necessary raw materials to process. Ensure that the supply chain from mining drills to furnaces is uninterrupted and functioning correctly.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- **Utility Functions**: None defined.\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks current inventory items and their quantities.\n  - `entities`: List[Entity] - Represents the entities on the map, including their positions and statuses."}
