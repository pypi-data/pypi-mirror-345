For instance, attempting to insert coal into a furnace without having coal in the inventory results in an error.\n\n### Errors When Structures Run Out of Fuel\n- Regularly check and refuel structures like mining drills and furnaces to prevent them from running out of fuel and halting production.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Defined Utility Functions\n- `insert_item`: Used to insert items into a target entity. Ensure the source inventory has the required items before invoking this function.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `copper_furnace`: Represents the copper furnace entity.\n- `iron_furnace`: Represents the iron furnace entity."}
