{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Electricity generator at position (117.5, -30.5)\nConsists of a steam engine at position (117.5, -30.5), a boiler at position (111.5, -32.0), and offshore pump at position (107.5, -33.5) connected by pipes.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position (60.0, -60.0)\nConsists of a stone furnace at position (60.0, -60.0) and a burner inserter at position (60.5, -61.5).\n\n### Copper cable factory\nNo information available in the provided logs.\n\n### Transport belt system\nConsists of two belts at positions (63.5, -53.5) and (64.5, -53.5) with direction UP.\n\n### Pipe system for water supply\nConsists of multiple pipes connected to the offshore pump at position (107.5, -33.5) and the boiler at position (111.5, -32.0).\n\n### Electricity distribution system\nConsists of a small electric pole at position (119.5, -30.5) connected to the steam engine.\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n* **No coal in inventory to refuel the boiler**: Ensure that the agent has coal in its inventory before attempting to refuel the boiler.\n* **Boiler or steam engine is not working correctly**: Check the connections and fuel supply to the boiler and steam engine. Ensure that the boiler has a fuel source and that the steam engine is connected to the boiler.\n* **No input liquid or no fluid present in connections**: Check the connections between the offshore pump, pipes, and boiler. Ensure that the offshore pump is supplying water to the pipes and that the pipes are connected to the boiler.\n* **No ingredients to smelt**: Ensure that the furnace has the necessary ingredients to smelt.\n\n# NAMESPACE\n* **Utility functions**:\n\t+ None defined in the provided logs.\n* **Important variables**:\n\t+ `transport-belt`: 8\n\t+ `small-electric-pole`: 1\n\t+ `pipe`: 20\n\t+ `stone-furnace`: 1\n\t+ `wood`: 7\n\t+ `copper-ore`: 20\n\t+ `iron-plate`: 613\n\t+ `copper-plate`: 5\n\t+ `copper-cable`: 2\n\t+ `iron-gear-wheel`: 2"}
