{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position 0.0, 0.0) with fuel (coal) and inventory for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n- Errors occurred when attempting to craft a stone furnace due to missing the required sub-ingredient (stone). Ensure to gather necessary raw resources before crafting items.\n- Ensure that the furnace has the required ingredients to smelt. The furnace reported 'no ingredients to smelt', indicating that the input resources were insufficient.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n- **Functions Defined**: \n  - `craft_item(Prototype.StoneFurnace)`: Failed due to missing sub-ingredients.\n  \n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `inventory: dict`: Current inventory of items (e.g., {'coal': 5, 'stone': 5}).\n  - `entities: list`: List of entities on the map (initially empty, updated with the stone furnace).\n  - `furnace_inventory: dict`: Inventory of the stone furnace (e.g., {'iron-ore': 4} after adding iron ore)."}
