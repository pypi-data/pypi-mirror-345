{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report (Updated)\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generation system at x=-25.0 y=80.5\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at x=-20.5 y=69.5 (connected to water system)\n- Boiler at x=-25.0 y=80.5 (currently out of fuel)\n- Steam engine at x=-25.5 y=89.5 (not connected to power network)\n- Pipe networks:\n  - Water system (ID 1454) connecting pump to boiler\n  - Steam system (ID 1458) not properly connected to engine\n\n### Copper mining operation at x=-46.5 y=70.5\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill at x=-46.5 y=70.5 (output blocked, no power)\n- Stone furnace at x=-46.0 y=74.0 (missing in latest steps)\n- Burner inserter at x=-46.5 y=72.5 (recently placed)\n- Wooden chest at x=-46.5 y=76.5 (empty output storage)\n- Small electric pole at x=-44.5 y=72.5 (not powering drill)\n\n### Iron mining operation at x=15.5 y=70.5\n(No changes from previous report)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill at x=15.5 y=70.5 (currently no power)\n- Stone furnace at x=16.0 y=74.0 (no ingredients)\n- Burner inserter at x=15.5 y=72.5 (working but missing from some steps)\n- Wooden chest at x=15.5 y=75.5 (empty output storage)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Persistent entity verification failures\n- Verify entity existence before operations (repeated attempts to access missing burner inserter and furnace)\n- Implement entity tracking system to monitor changes in entity states\n\n### Power system issues\n- Connect electric mining drills to power network (copper drill shows \"no power\")\n- Ensure proper fuel supply for boiler (currently out of fuel)\n- Verify steam engine connections (still not connected to power network)\n\n### Placement and distance problems\n- Move closer before placing entities (failed chest placement at x=-46.5 y=76.5)\n- Implement distance checks before placement attempts\n- Verify terrain suitability for placement (stone furnace placement issues)\n\n### Production chain problems\n- Clear output blockages on mining drills (copper drill shows \"output blocked\")\n- Ensure proper inserter connections (new burner inserter needs verification)\n- Verify furnace existence and connections (missing furnace at copper operation)\n\n### Fluid system issues\n- Complete steam pipe connection between boiler and engine\n- Verify fluid system IDs and connections (steam system ID 1458 not connected)\n\n### System verification\n- Implement pre-operation checks for all systems (power, fluids, production)\n- Verify entity inventories before attempting operations\n- Monitor system status indicators (warnings and error messages)"}
