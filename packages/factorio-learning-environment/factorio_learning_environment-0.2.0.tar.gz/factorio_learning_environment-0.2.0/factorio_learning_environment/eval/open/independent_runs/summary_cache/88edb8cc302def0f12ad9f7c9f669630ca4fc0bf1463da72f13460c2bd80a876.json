{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System (Updated)\n- **Offshore pump** at (-9.5, 19.5) - Now connected with water flow (100 units)\n- **Boiler** at (18.0, 22.5) - Has water input but missing fuel (coal)\n- **Steam engine** at (22.5, 22.5) - Disconnected from power network despite operational status\n- **Secondary offshore pump** at (-9.5, -0.5) - Still disconnected with warnings\n\n### Oil Production Complex (Critical Update)\n- **Pumpjack** at (17.5, 40.5) - Missing (removed/failed placement attempts)\n- **Oil refinery** at (27.5, 40.5) - Powered but showing NO_POWER status\n- **Broken pipe network** - Multiple disconnected segments between (24.5,40.5) and refinery\n\n### Chemical Production Area (Updated)\n- **Chemical plant** at (37.5, 22.5) - Configured for sulfur but missing power\n- **Storage tank** at (32.5, 22.5) - Connected but empty\n- **Output chest** at (40.5, 22.5) - Still unused in production chain\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Critical Placement Failures (New)\n- **Pumpjack replacement attempts** - Verify terrain is land before placement (current attempts on water)\n- **Entity disappearance** - Confirm entity existence before operations (pumpjack at 17.5,40.5 missing)\n- **Power network disconnection** - Steam engine at 22.5,22.5 not connected despite nearby poles\n\n### Persistent Fluid System Issues\n- **Distance limitations** - Move within 10 tiles before pipe placement (current max: 11 tiles)\n- **Underground pipe spacing** - Minimum 4-tile spacing still not being enforced\n- **Connection validation** - Verify all connection points are clear before attempting links\n\n### Power System Optimization\n- **Generator isolation** - Steam engine remains disconnected from chemical plant\n- **Voltage monitoring** - Current network voltage at 0 (critical failure)\n\n### Placement Protocol (Updated)\n- **Terrain verification** - Implement water/land checks before pumpjack placement\n- **Entity existence confirmation** - Add verification step before operating on entities\n- **Adjacent testing** - Systematically test all adjacent positions when blocked\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Functions\n- `connect_fluid_system()` - Now requires terrain validation\n- `verify_power_connection()` - Needs voltage monitoring enhancement\n\n### Variables\n- `pumpjack_pos` - Now invalid due to missing entity\n- `refinery_pos` - Power connection failure identified\n- `chemical_plant_pos` - Power verification needed\n- `blocked_pipe_pos` - Multiple new blockage points identified"}
