{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Setup at (-15, -50)\nConsists of:\n- Two burner mining drills mining iron ore at positions (-15, -50) and (-19, -50)\n- Wooden chests collecting ore at positions (-14.5, -48.5) and (-18.5, -48.5)\n- Both drills are operational with coal fuel\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nConsists of:\n- Two stone furnaces at positions (0, 0) and (2, 0) for smelting iron plates\n- Two input wooden chests at positions (-2.5, 0.5) and (4.5, 0.5) holding iron ore\n- Two burner inserters:\n  - At (-1.5, 0.5) moving ore from first chest to first furnace\n  - At (3.5, 0.5) moving ore from second chest to second furnace\n- Both furnaces and inserters are fueled with coal\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Placement Distance Errors\n- Move closer to target location before placing entities - maximum placement distance is 10 tiles\n\n### Resource Requirements for Crafting\n- Ensure all raw materials are gathered before attempting crafting\n- Wood is a raw resource that must be gathered, not crafted\n\n### Entity Placement Conflicts\n- Check for existing entities before placement\n- Increase spacing or change direction when placing entities next to existing ones\n- Verify mining drill placement has resources within its mining area\n\n### Inventory Management\n- Verify required items are in inventory before placement or insertion\n- Empty collection chests when they become full to prevent mining stoppage\n\n### Resource Insertion\n- Ensure required materials are in inventory before attempting to insert into entities\n- Keep track of fuel and resource levels in machines"}
