{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Setup at Position (x=2.0, y=-63.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at Position (x=2.0, y=-63.0) - Extracts iron ore but is currently out of fuel.\n- **Stone Furnace** at Position (x=4.0, y=-63.0) - Smelts iron ore into iron plates but has no ingredients to smelt.\n- **Stone Furnace** at Position (x=6.0, y=-63.0) - Smelts iron ore into iron plates but has no ingredients to smelt.\n- **Burner Inserter** at Position (x=3.5, y=-61.5) - Transfers items between the mining drill and furnace but is blocked due to a full chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at Position (x=2.5, y=-61.5) - Stores iron ore (currently contains 251 iron ore).\n\n---\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when using undefined or incorrect API functions\n- Ensure the correct function is used for the intended action. For example, `drop_item` is not a valid function; use `insert_item` or `craft_item` instead.\n\n#### Errors when extracting items\n- Ensure the source entity (e.g., chest) exists and contains the items you are trying to extract before calling `extract_item`.\n\n#### Errors when placing entities without required inventory\n- Verify that the required item (e.g., wooden chest) is in your inventory before attempting to place it.\n\n#### Errors when crafting without required resources\n- Gather all raw resources (e.g., wood) before attempting to craft items like wooden chests.\n\n#### Errors when picking up items with a full inventory\n- Ensure your inventory has space before attempting to pick up items.\n\n#### Errors when accessing non-existent entities\n- Confirm the entity exists at the specified position before attempting to interact with it (e.g., `get_entity`).\n\n#### Errors when placing entities in occupied tiles\n- Ensure the target tile is free before placing an entity."}
