{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Mining and Smelting Operation at (15.5, 70.5)\n- **Electric mining drill** at (15.5, 70.5) extracting iron ore\n- **Stone furnace** at (16.0, 73.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates\n- Connected to power grid via small electric poles\n\n#### Copper Mining and Smelting Operation at (-46.5, 70.5)\n- **Electric mining drill** at (-46.5, 70.5) extracting copper ore\n- **Stone furnace** at (-46.0, 73.0) smelting copper ore into copper plates\n- Connected to power grid via small electric poles\n\n#### Coal Mining Operation at (15.5, -0.5)\n- **Electric mining drill** at (15.5, -0.5) extracting coal\n- **Wooden chest** at (15.5, 1.5) storing coal\n- Connected to power grid via small electric poles\n\n#### Stone Mining Operation at (-46.5, -0.5)\n- **Electric mining drill** at (-46.5, -0.5) extracting stone\n- **Stone furnace** at (-46.0, 3.0) smelting stone (though currently not operational)\n- Connected to power grid via small electric poles\n\n#### Power Generation System at (-9.5, -1.5)\n- **Offshore pump** at (-9.5, -1.5) providing water\n- **Boiler** at (-5.0, 1.5) converting water to steam (currently out of fuel)\n- **Steam engine** at (0.5, 5.5) generating electricity (currently not connected properly)\n- Connected via pipe network for fluid transfer\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Placement Errors\n- Cannot place entities where other objects already exist. Always check tile availability before placement.\n- Stone furnace placement attempts failed at (-46.5, 1.5) due to existing objects.\n\n#### Power Issues\n- Multiple electric mining drills show \"not receiving electricity\" warnings. Ensure proper power grid connections.\n- Steam engine shows \"not connected to power network\" - verify electrical connections.\n\n#### Entity Access Errors\n- Attempted to access non-existent stone furnace at (-46.0, 3.0). Always verify entity existence before access.\n- Tried to access 'warning' attribute that doesn't exist on ElectricMiningDrill objects.\n\n#### Operational Issues\n- Coal chest at (15.5, 1.5) was full, blocking mining operations. Regularly empty storage containers.\n- Boiler shows \"out of fuel\" warning - maintain fuel supply for continuous operation.\n- Multiple furnaces show \"belt at drop position is blocked\" - ensure clear output paths.\n\n#### Fluid System Problems\n- Steam engine shows \"no input liquid\" and \"no fluid present\" warnings - verify proper fluid connections.\n- Boiler to steam engine pipe connection may be incomplete or blocked."}
