{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining Setup at Position(41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (41.0, -82.0) facing down\n- Wooden chest at (41.5, -80.5) containing 81 coal\n- Burner inserter at (41.5, -79.5) moving items from drill to chest\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Setup at Position(-18.0, -53.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (-18.0, -53.0) facing down\n- Wooden chest at (-17.5, -51.5)\n- Burner inserter at (-16.5, -51.5) facing right\n\n### Smelting Area at Position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Two stone furnaces at (0.0, 0.0) and (2.0, 0.0)\n- Two burner inserters at (0.5, -1.5) and (2.5, -1.5) facing down\n\n### Transport Belt Network\nComplex belt system consisting of multiple connected belt groups:\n- Main input belt from iron ore mining area (-17.5, -51.5)\n- Multiple interconnected belt sections forming a transport path\n- Belt system extends through various positions with multiple direction changes\n- Contains some iron ore in transit (10 units)\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Belt Placement\n- Always check if a tile is occupied before placing a new belt\n- Remove existing belts before trying to place new ones at the same position\n- Verify the target position is clear using the game's coordinate system\n\n### Errors with Entity Pickup\n- Verify the entity exists at the specified coordinates before attempting pickup\n- Double check coordinates when trying to pickup transport belts\n\n### Errors with Item Insertion\n- Ensure required items are in inventory before attempting to insert them into entities\n- Check inventory contents before performing insert operations\n\n### Errors with Entity Connections\n- Verify you have required items in inventory before attempting to connect entities\n- Plan belt connections carefully to avoid placement conflicts\n\n### General Tips\n- Keep track of entity positions and orientations when modifying existing structures\n- Remove problematic entities before attempting to place new ones\n- Monitor fuel levels in burner devices to maintain operation\n- Verify space availability in destination containers"}
