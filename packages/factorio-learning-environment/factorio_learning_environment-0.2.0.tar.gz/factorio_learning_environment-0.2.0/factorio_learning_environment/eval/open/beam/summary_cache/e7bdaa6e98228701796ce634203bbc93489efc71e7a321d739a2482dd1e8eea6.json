{"content": "It seems that the command to move to the nearest stone resource patch was executed successfully, but there was no output provided to confirm the action. This could indicate that the environment is now positioned at the stone resource location.\n\n### Summary of Actions and Errors:\n1. **Gathering Resources**: Successfully gathered 5 units of iron ore and 5 units of coal.\n2. **Crafting Attempt**: Attempted to craft a Stone Furnace but encountered an error because I had not gathered stone, which is required for the furnace recipe.\n3. **Next Steps**: Moved to the nearest stone resource patch to gather the necessary stone.\n\n### Tips and Logic Patterns to Avoid Errors:\n1. **Resource Awareness**: Always check the requirements for crafting before attempting to craft an item. Use `get_prototype_recipe()` to understand what is needed.\n2. **Gathering Order**: Prioritize gathering all necessary resources before crafting. For example, ensure you have stone, iron ore, and coal before trying to craft a Stone Furnace.\n3. **Inventory Inspection**: Regularly inspect your inventory using `inspect_inventory()` to keep track of what resources you have and what you still need.\n4. **Movement Confirmation**: After moving to a resource patch, confirm that you are in the correct location before attempting to gather resources. This can help avoid unnecessary errors.\n5. **Error Handling**: Implement error handling to gracefully manage situations where resources are missing or crafting fails. This can include retrying the action or providing clear messages about what is needed next.\n\nBy following these patterns, I can streamline my resource gathering and crafting processes, reducing the likelihood of encountering similar errors in the future. \n\n### Next Steps:\nNow that I have moved to the stone resource patch, I will proceed to gather the required stone to craft the Stone Furnace.", "summary_range": "[1-36]"}
