{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0): Extracts iron ore from the resource patch. Currently fueled with coal and operational.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5): Stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill. Contains 7 units of iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5): Transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the stone furnace. Requires coal as fuel and is currently out of fuel.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates. Currently not receiving iron ore due to misalignment or lack of fuel in the inserter.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Alignment and Fueling\n- Ensure the inserter is correctly aligned to transfer materials from the chest to the furnace. Reposition and align inserters as needed.\n- Regularly refuel inserters with coal to maintain continuous operation. Monitor fuel levels to prevent stoppages.\n\n### Errors with Chest Management\n- Prevent the chest from becoming full by regularly extracting iron ore to free up space. This will ensure continuous mining operations.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Operations\n- Ensure the furnace is receiving iron ore by checking the inserter setup and alignment. Misalignment or lack of fuel in the inserter can prevent the furnace from receiving materials.\n- Monitor the furnace's fuel levels to ensure it has enough coal to operate efficiently.\n\n### General Inventory Management\n- Keep track of coal and other resources in the inventory to ensure all entities remain operational. Harvest additional resources as needed to prevent shortages."}
