{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at position (10, 0)\nConsists of:\n- Steam engine at position (10.0, 0.0)\n- Boiler at position (x, y) [exact position not provided]\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at position (1, 1)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at position (1.0, 1.0) and a furnace at position (10.0, 1.0)\n- Burner mining drill at position (x1, y1) [exact position not provided] and a furnace at position (x2, y2) [exact position not provided]\n\n### Copper Cable Factory\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine at position (z1) [exact position not provided] and inserter at position (a) [exact position not provided] that puts into assembling machine\n- Beltgroup connecting the furnace at position (y1) to assembling machine at position (z1)\n\n### Lab at position (6.5, 1.5)\nConsists of:\n- Lab at position (6.5, 1.5) with no power\n- Burner inserter at position (8.5, 1.5) with out of fuel status\n\n### Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, 24.5) that is working and connected to pipes\n\n### Pipe Group\nConsists of:\n- Pipe group connected to the offshore pump and transporting water\n\n### Chests\nConsists of:\n- Wooden chest at position (3.5, 1.5) with iron-plate\n- Wooden chest at position (3.5, 3.5) with iron-plate\n- Wooden chest at position (3.5, 5.5) with no items\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing new electric poles\n- Ensure there are no entities blocking the target location before attempting to place electric poles. If the area is obstructed or unplaceable (e.g., water), relocate the pole to a valid position.\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities\n- Verify that the entity you are trying to access (e.g., steam engine) exists at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it. If the entity is not found, check if it has been placed correctly or if it has been removed.\n\n### Repeated errors\n- The same errors regarding placing electric poles and retrieving the steam engine have occurred multiple times. Make sure to address the underlying issues causing these errors to avoid repetition in future steps."}
