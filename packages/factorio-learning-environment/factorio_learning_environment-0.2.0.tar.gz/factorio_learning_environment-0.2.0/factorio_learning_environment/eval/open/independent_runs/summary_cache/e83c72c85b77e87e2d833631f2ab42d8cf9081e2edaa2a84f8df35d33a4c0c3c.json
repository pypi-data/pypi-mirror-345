{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=0.5, y=28.0)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (x=-3.5, y=27.5)\n- Boiler at Position (x=0.5, y=28.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (x=10.5, y=34.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting the offshore pump and boiler, with positions from (x=-3.5, y=26.5) to (x=-1.5, y=28.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting the boiler and steam engine, with positions from (x=1.5, y=26.5) to (x=10.5, y=31.5)\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (x=40.0, y=-84.0) with a drop position at (x=40.5, y=-82.5)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (x=40.5, y=-82.5) and another at (x=41.5, y=-83.5)\n- Burner Inserter at Position (x=54.5, y=-83.5) with a pickup position at (x=53.5, y=-83.5) and drop position at (x=55.5, y=-83.5)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (x=56.5, y=-83.5) containing iron plates\n- BeltGroup with belts connecting various positions for coal transport\n\n### Iron Plate Storage\nConsists of:\n- Iron Chest at Position (x=0.5, y=0.5) containing coal and iron plates\n- Iron Chest at Position (x=1.5, y=0.5) containing coal\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=-15.0, y=-49.0) with a warning of no ingredients to smelt\n\n### Research Lab\nConsists of:\n- Lab with input for automation science packs and status indicating no power\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Warnings of Full Inventory in Mining Drill\n- Ensure to regularly empty chests at drop positions to prevent mining operations from halting due to full inventory.\n\n### Boiler Out of Fuel\n- Regularly refuel boilers to maintain continuous power generation. Consider automating fuel supply to boilers.\n\n### Steam Engine Not Connected to Power Network\n- Ensure that steam engines are properly connected to the power network and have a steady input of steam to function effectively.\n\n### Furnace with No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Ensure that furnaces have a consistent supply of raw materials to process. Automate the supply chain to maintain efficiency.\n\n### Lab with No Power\n- Connect labs to a power source to enable research activities. Ensure that the power network is functioning and capable of supplying sufficient electricity."}
