{"content": "I notice that the inserter is being placed at (19.5, -18.5) instead of the intended position at (20.5, -17.5), which is where we need it to be to pick up from the drill's drop position. Let's try to place it more precisely:\n\n```python\n# First check what we need to craft a burner inserter\nrecipe = get_prototype_recipe(Prototype.BurnerInserter)\nprint(f\"Burner inserter recipe: {recipe}\")\n\n# Check our current inventory\ninventory = inspect_inventory()\nprint(f\"Current inventory: {inventory}\")\n\n# Craft the burner inserter\ncraft_item(Prototype.BurnerInserter, 1)\nprint(\"Crafted burner inserter\")\n\n# Get our reference entities\ndrill = get_entities({Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill})[0]\nfurnace = get_entities({Prototype.StoneFurnace})[0]\n\nprint(f\"Drill drop position: {drill.drop_position}\")\nprint(f\"Furnace position: {furnace.position}\")\n\n# Move to the exact drop position\nmove_to(Position(x=20.296875, y=-17.49609375))\nprint(f\"Moved to exact drill drop position\")\n\n# Place the inserter exactly at the drill's drop position\ninserter = place_entity(\n    Prototype.BurnerInserter,\n    position=Position(x=20.296875, y=-17.49609375),  # Exact drop position\n    direction=Direction.RIGHT  # Face towards furnace\n)\nprint(f\"Placed inserter at {inserter.position}\")\n\n# Add fuel to inserter\ninsert_item(Prototype.Coal, inserter, quantity=1)\nprint(\"Added fuel to inserter\")\n\n# Verify setup\nprint(f\"Final setup:\")\nprint(f\"Drill drop position: {drill.drop_position}\")\nprint(f\"Inserter pickup/drop positions: {inserter.pickup_position}, {inserter.drop_position}\")\nprint(f\"Furnace position: {furnace.position}\")\n```\n\nThis time I'm:\n1. Using the exact coordinates from the drill's drop position\n2. Moving to those exact coordinates first\n3. Placing the inserter at those exact coordinates\n4. Making sure it's facing the right direction to feed into the furnace\n\nThis should place the inserter in exactly the right spot to pick up from the drill and deposit into the furnace.", "summary_range": "[1-3008]"}
