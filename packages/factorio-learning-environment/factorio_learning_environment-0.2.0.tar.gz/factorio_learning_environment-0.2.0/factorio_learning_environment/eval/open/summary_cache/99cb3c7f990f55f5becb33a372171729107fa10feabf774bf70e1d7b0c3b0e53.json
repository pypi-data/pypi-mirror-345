{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, -0.5)\n- Boiler at position (-6.0, -0.5)\n- Steam Engine at position (-2.5, -0.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting the offshore pump to the boiler with pipes at positions [(x=-6.5,y=-2.5),(x=-7.5,y=-2.5),(x=-8.5,y=-0.5),(x=-7.5,y=-1.5),(x=-7.5,y=-0.5)]\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Electric Mining Drill at position (15.5, 70.5) with a wooden chest at position (15.5, 72.5) for collection\n- Electric Mining Drill at position (18.5, 70.5) with a wooden chest at position (18.5, 72.5) for collection\n- Both drills are connected to a small electric pole network for power supply\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors When Connecting Electrical Entities\n- Ensure that the entities you are trying to connect are within range and that there are no missing or incorrect references to entities.\n\n### Errors When Finding Nearest Entity\n- Verify that the target entity exists on the map before attempting to find or interact with it.\n\n### Errors When Asserting Drill Power\n- Ensure that all drills are connected to a power source and that the power source is operational.\n\n### Errors When Connecting Fluid Entities\n- Check that the source and target connection points are not blocked and that the target can receive fluids from the source.\n\n### Errors Due to Undefined Functions\n- Make sure to define any custom functions before using them in your code. Ensure that you are calling the correct function names.\n\n### Errors When Placing Entities at a Distance\n- Move closer to the target position before placing an entity to ensure you are within the maximum placement distance.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Defined Functions\n- `get_entity(entity: Any, position: Any) -> Any`: Retrieves an entity at a specified position.\n- `rotate_entity(entity: Any, direction: Any) -> Any`: Rotates an entity in the specified direction.\n- `pickup_entity(entity: Any, position: Any) -> Any`: Picks up an entity from a specified position.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `power_source_position`: Position variable intended to store the location of a power source.\n- `pipes_to_steam_engine`: Variable intended to store the connection between a boiler and a steam engine using pipes.\n- `chest_1`: Variable intended to store the position of a wooden chest placed to collect resources from a drill."}
