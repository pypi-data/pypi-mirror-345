{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll create a comprehensive report:\n\n# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Transport System at (-80.5, -82)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0) facing DOWN\n- Wooden chest at (41.5, -80.5)\n- Burner inserter at (42.5, -80.5) facing RIGHT\n- Transport belt at (43.5, -80.5) moving RIGHT\n- Burner inserter at (44.5, -80.5) facing RIGHT\n- Stone furnace at (47.0, -80.0) facing UP\n\nThe system appears to be a coal mining and transport setup where:\n1. Mining drill extracts coal and outputs to chest\n2. First inserter moves coal from chest to transport belt\n3. Second inserter picks up from belt at (43.5, -80.5) and attempts to drop at (45.5, -80.5)\n4. Furnace is placed nearby but seems misaligned with the inserter system\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Furnace Placement and Alignment Issues\n- Multiple attempts to place furnace at different positions show alignment problems with the inserter system\n- Ensure furnace position aligns with inserter drop position (45.5, -80.5)\n- Consider the full dimensions (2x2) of the furnace when placing it relative to inserters\n\n### Blocked Transport Systems\n- Transport belt getting blocked due to misaligned output positions\n- Clear blocked belts before attempting to rebuild structures\n- Ensure proper spacing between components to prevent blockages\n\n### Entity Rotation Issues\n- Furnace rotation failed - verify if the entity type supports rotation\n- Plan the initial placement direction correctly since some entities may not support rotation\n\n### Space Management\n- Chest getting full (at 41.5, -80.5) - implement a system to manage chest capacity\n- Items blocking ground preventing proper operation - clear items from ground before rebuilding\n\n# NAMESPACE\n\n### Variables\n- furnace: Entity (stone-furnace)\n- belt: Entity (transport-belt)\n\n### Functions\n- place_entity_next_to(entity_type, reference_position, spacing, direction): Places entity relative to reference point\n- rotate_entity(entity, direction): Attempts to rotate an entity\n- clear_blocked_belt(): Clears items blocking transport belts\n\n### Function Outcomes\n- place_entity_next_to: Failed when trying to place furnace due to existing entity conflicts\n- rotate_entity: Failed when attempting to rotate furnace\n- clear_blocked_belt: Successfully cleared blocked belt items"}
