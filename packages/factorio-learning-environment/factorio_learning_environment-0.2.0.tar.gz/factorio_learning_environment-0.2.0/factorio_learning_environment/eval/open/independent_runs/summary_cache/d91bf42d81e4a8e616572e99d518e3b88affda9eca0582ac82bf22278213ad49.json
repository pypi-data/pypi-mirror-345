Reposition and align the inserter if necessary.\n\n### Errors with Fuel Management\n- Regularly check and refuel the burner inserter to prevent it from running out of fuel. This will ensure continuous operation and prevent interruptions in the transfer of iron ore.\n\n### Errors with Chest Management\n- Monitor the chest inventory to prevent it from becoming full. Empty the chest at the drop position to continue mining operations without interruptions.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Operation\n- Ensure that the furnace is receiving the necessary ingredients to smelt. Check the inserter setup and the availability of iron ore in the chest to resolve any issues with ingredient supply."}
