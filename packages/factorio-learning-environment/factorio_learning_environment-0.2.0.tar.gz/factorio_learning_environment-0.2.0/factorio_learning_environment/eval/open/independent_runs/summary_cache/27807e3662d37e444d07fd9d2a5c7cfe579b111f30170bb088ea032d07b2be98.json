{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing Facility at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (41.0, -82.0) with a drop position at (41.5, -80.5), working status, and warning that the chest at drop position is full.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (43.0, -82.0), currently with no ingredients to smelt.\n- **Iron Chests** at positions (41.5, -80.5) and (42.5, -80.5), with inventories containing coal and iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserters** at positions (43.5, -80.5) and (41.5, -78.5), with one waiting for source items and another working.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) with a drop position at (-14.5, -48.5), working status, and warning that the chest at drop position is full.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-13.0, -48.0), currently with no ingredients to smelt.\n- **Iron Chests** at positions (-14.5, -48.5), (-15.5, -48.5), and (-13.5, -49.5), with inventories containing iron ore and iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserters** at positions (-10.5, -49.5), (-11.5, -49.5), and (-8.5, -44.5), with some waiting for source items and others working.\n\n### Storage and Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Iron Chests** at multiple positions including (-12.5, -45.5), (-10.5, -45.5), (-8.5, -45.5), and (47.5, -80.5), with varying inventories of iron plates, coal, and iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-10.5, -45.5) and (-11.5, -45.5), containing iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserters** at positions (-12.5, -44.5), (-10.5, -44.5), and (-8.5, -44.5), with some waiting for space in destination or working.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Chest Placement and Retrieval\n- Ensure that the target position for placing a chest is not already occupied by another entity. Remove any existing entity before placing a new one.\n- Verify the existence of a chest at a specified position before attempting to retrieve or interact with it.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Blockages\n- Regularly check and clear the inventory of chests to prevent inserter blockages due to full inventories.\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity in place to accept the output from inserters to avoid output blockages.\n\n### Errors with Source Chests Being Empty\n- Ensure that source chests have sufficient items before attempting to transfer items from them.\n\n### Errors with Inventory Management\n- Monitor the inventory levels of chests and adjust the flow of items to prevent overfilling or underutilization of storage space."}
