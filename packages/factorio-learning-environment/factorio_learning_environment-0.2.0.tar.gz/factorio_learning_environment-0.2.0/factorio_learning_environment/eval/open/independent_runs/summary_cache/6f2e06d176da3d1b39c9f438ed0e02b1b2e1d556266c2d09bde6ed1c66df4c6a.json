{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-16.0, -51.0) with a drop position at (-16.5, -52.5). The drill is fueled with coal and is currently working, but has a warning indicating that its output is blocked by an item on the ground, and there is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-14.0, -49.0). The furnace is fueled with coal and has a warning indicating that there are no ingredients to smelt. It currently contains iron plates as a result.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied locations\n- Ensure the target tile is unoccupied before attempting to place any entity such as Transport Belts, Burner Inserters, Wooden Chests, or Stone Furnaces. This will prevent placement errors.\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities at specific positions\n- Verify the existence of an entity at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it. This will prevent errors like \"Could not get Prototype.StoneFurnace at position\".\n\n### Errors due to blocked outputs\n- Ensure that the output of drills or other production entities is not blocked by items on the ground. Place a sink entity to accept the output and prevent blockage.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into entities\n- Check your inventory to ensure that you have the required items before attempting to insert them into entities, such as drills or furnaces.\n\n### Errors when moving entities\n- Confirm that the destination location is valid and unoccupied before attempting to move entities like Stone Furnaces to prevent movement errors."}
