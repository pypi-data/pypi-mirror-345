{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-59.5, -111.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (-59.5, -111.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-46.5, -122.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-68.5, -95.5)\n- Connected by PipeGroups and Small Electric Poles to distribute power\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-15.0, -76.0) connected to an Iron Chest at Position (-15.5, -77.5)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-19.0, -73.0) for smelting iron ore\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0) and (6.0, -62.0) for smelting copper ore\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) to move items between entities\n- Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5) for storage\n\n### Power Distribution Network\nConsists of:\n- Small Electric Poles connecting various entities to the power grid\n\n### Lab at Position (unknown)\n- Lab with no research in progress, requires automation science packs\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Entities without Required Items\n- Ensure you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to connect entities. For example, crafting Small Electric Poles requires wood and copper cables.\n\n### Errors when Entities are Not Receiving Power\n- Verify that all entities requiring electricity are properly connected to the power network with sufficient power supply.\n\n### Errors with Full Inventory or Output\n- Regularly check and manage the inventory of chests and furnaces to prevent them from becoming full, which can halt production processes."}
