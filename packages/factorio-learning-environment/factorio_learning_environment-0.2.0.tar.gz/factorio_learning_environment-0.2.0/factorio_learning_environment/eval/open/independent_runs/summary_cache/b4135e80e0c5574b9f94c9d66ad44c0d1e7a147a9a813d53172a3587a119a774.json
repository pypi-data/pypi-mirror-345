{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=-3.5, y=26.0)\nConsists of:\n- Boiler at position (x=-3.5, y=26.0)\n- Steam engine at position (x=5.5, y=26.5)\n- Multiple electric poles connected to the steam engine at various positions:\n  - Electric pole at (x=8.5, y=3.5)\n  - Electric pole at (x=10.5, y=13.5)\n  - Electric pole at (x=15.5, y=12.5)\n  - Electric pole at (x=5.5, y=29.5)\n  - Electric pole at (x=1.5, y=10.5)\n  - Electric pole at (x=7.5, y=8.5)\n  - Electric pole at (x=26.5, y=17.5)\n  - Electric pole at (x=30.5, y=17.5)\n  - Electric pole at (x=20.5, y=19.5)\n  - Electric pole at (x=21.5, y=27.5)\n  - Electric pole at (x=27.5, y=26.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors When Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure that the pipe connection path is clear and that the pipe can reach the target entity. The error indicates a failure to connect a pipe from the boiler output at (x=-3.5, y=24.5) to the steam engine at (x=5.5, y=26.5). Check for obstacles or incorrect positioning of pipes.\n\n### Errors When Using Extracting but Being Too Far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors When Placing into a Tile Which is Occupied by Another Entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Defined Functions\n- `connect_entities`: Attempts to connect two entities using a specified prototype (e.g., `Prototype.Pipe`). The function failed multiple times due to an inability to connect the pipe between the boiler output and the steam engine.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `pipe_group`: A variable intended to store the result of connecting entities, specifically pipes in this context. The connection attempts failed, resulting in a `nil` value."}
