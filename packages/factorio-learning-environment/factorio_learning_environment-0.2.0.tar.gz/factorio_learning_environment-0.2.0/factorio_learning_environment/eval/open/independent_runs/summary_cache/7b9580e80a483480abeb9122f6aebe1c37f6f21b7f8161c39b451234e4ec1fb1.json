{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nThis structure is responsible for mining iron ore and converting it into iron plates. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) which extracts iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) which stores the extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) which transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the stone furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0) which processes the iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when extracting items from non-existent or empty entities\n- Ensure that the target entity (e.g., wooden chest) contains the expected items before attempting to extract them. Verify the entity's inventory to prevent extraction errors.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient fuel\n- Regularly check and maintain adequate fuel levels in all fuel-dependent entities such as mining drills, inserters, and furnaces to ensure continuous operation.\n\n### Errors due to full storage\n- Monitor storage entities like chests to prevent them from becoming full. Empty them regularly to avoid halting production processes.\n\n### Errors when placing or aligning inserters\n- Ensure that inserters are correctly aligned and positioned to facilitate the transfer of items between entities. Double-check their orientation and connection to source and destination entities."}
