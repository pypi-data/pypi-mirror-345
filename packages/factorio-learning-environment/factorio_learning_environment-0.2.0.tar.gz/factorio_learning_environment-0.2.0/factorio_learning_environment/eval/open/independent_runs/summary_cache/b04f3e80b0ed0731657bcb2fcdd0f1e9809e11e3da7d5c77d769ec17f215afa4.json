{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll summarize the structures and error tips:\n\n# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Smelting Setup at (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-15.0, -50.0) facing down, mining iron ore\n- Burner inserter at (-14.5, -48.5) connecting drill to furnace\n- Stone furnace at (-14.0, -47.0)\nAll components have coal fuel added and are operational, though the mining drill is waiting for space in destination.\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied spaces\n- Check if target position is already occupied by another entity before placing\n- When using place_entity_next_to(), ensure proper spacing and direction parameters to avoid collisions\n- Consider increasing spacing or changing direction if initial placement fails\n\n### Errors with missing inventory items\n- Verify required items are in inventory before attempting to insert/use them\n- When crafting items that require intermediate products (like iron plates), ensure you have a way to produce those first\n- For burner entities, ensure you have coal in inventory before attempting to add fuel\n\n### Errors with entity attributes access\n- Cannot directly add ModelPrivateAttr objects (like entity dimensions)\n- Use proper accessor methods or properties to get entity dimensions\n\n### Errors with entity placement coordination  \n- When creating production chains, plan entity positions carefully to ensure:\n  - Mining drill output aligns with inserter pickup\n  - Inserter drop aligns with furnace input\n  - Sufficient space between entities for inserter operation\n\n### Inventory management errors\n- Track inventory levels to ensure sufficient materials before crafting/building\n- Consider fuel requirements when planning number of burner entities\n- Account for intermediate products needed in crafting recipes"}
