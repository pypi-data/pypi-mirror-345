{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Iron Ore Storage**: Iron chest at position (x=-5.5, y=-50.5) containing iron ore.\n- **Furnaces**: \n  - Stone furnace at position (x=-15.0, y=-48.0)\n  - Stone furnace at position (x=-13.0, y=-48.0)\n  - Stone furnace at position (x=-11.0, y=-48.0)\n- **Output Storage**: Multiple wooden chests at positions (x=-14.5, y=-50.5), (x=-13.5, y=-50.5), (x=-12.5, y=-50.5), (x=-11.5, y=-50.5), (x=-10.5, y=-50.5), (x=-9.5, y=-50.5), (x=-8.5, y=-50.5), (x=-7.5, y=-50.5), (x=-6.5, y=-50.5) containing iron plates.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Station\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill**: Positioned at (x=4.0, y=-60.0), extracting iron ore.\n- **Storage Chests**: \n  - Wooden chest at position (x=5.5, y=-60.5)\n  - Wooden chest at position (x=4.5, y=-58.5) containing iron ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Full Chests\n- Ensure that chests used for storing output from mining drills or furnaces are not full. Regularly check and empty chests to prevent production halts.\n\n### Errors with Furnaces\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Regularly supply furnaces with iron ore to maintain continuous production.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `iron_ore_count: int` - Represents the count of iron ore in storage.\n- `iron_plate_count: int` - Represents the count of iron plates in storage.\n- `coal_count: int` - Represents the count of coal available for fuel.\n- `wood_count: int` - Represents the count of wood in inventory.\n- `iron_gear_wheel_count: int` - Represents the count of iron gear wheels in inventory."}
