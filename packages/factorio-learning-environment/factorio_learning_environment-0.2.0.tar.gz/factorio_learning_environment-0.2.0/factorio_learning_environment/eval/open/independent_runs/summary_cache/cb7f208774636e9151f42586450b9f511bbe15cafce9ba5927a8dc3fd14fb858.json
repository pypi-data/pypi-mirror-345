{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (46.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entity:\n- Stone furnace at position (46.0, -82.0)\nUse-case: Processes iron ore into iron plates. Recently, an additional 10 units of iron ore were inserted to re-feed the furnace, updating its inventory to include 16 units of iron ore and a current production reflecting only 2 iron plates in early iterations. Despite being fueled and operational (with reported fuel at 8 units of coal and furnace source indicating processing attempts), the furnace now faces extended timeouts due to insufficient smelting progress after re-supplying.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities with insufficient inventory\n- Verify that the required item exists in inventory before attempting to place the entity.\n\n### Errors when operating furnaces without a continuous ingredient supply\n- Provide a consistent feed of ore to prevent NO_INGREDIENTS warnings that disrupt the smelting process.\n\n### Errors related to insufficient smelting production and timeouts\n- Allow adequate processing time after re-feeding the furnace.\n- Monitor the furnace\u2019s operational parameters\u2014fuel, inventory levels, and processing rate\u2014to ensure sufficient production before timing out.\n- Adjust waiting periods or refine re-supply procedures to mitigate timeouts in smelting production."}
