{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (52.0, -82.0) with a fuel inventory of coal and status indicating waiting for space in destination.\n- Wooden Chest at position (53.5, -80.5) for storing mined coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (52.5, -79.5) transferring coal to a chest at position (52.5, -78.5), which is currently full.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-12.0, -51.0) extracting iron ore, with a drop position at (-11.5, -49.5).\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) intended for smelting iron ore but currently lacking ingredients.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-11.5, -49.5) storing extracted iron ore.\n- Multiple Burner Inserters at positions (-11.5, -48.5), (-8.5, -48.5), and (-13.5, -46.5) waiting for source items to transfer.\n\n### Storage Facility\n- Wooden Chest at position (0.5, 0.5) for general storage purposes.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Item Extraction\n- Ensure that the target chest for extraction is not full and that there is space in the player's inventory before attempting to extract items.\n- Verify that the extraction function is correctly targeting a valid source with available items.\n\n### Inserter Blockages\n- Check that the destination chest for inserters is not full to prevent blockages.\n- Ensure that the source items are available for inserters to function correctly.\n\n### Invalid Prototype Usage\n- When using the `insert_item` function, ensure that the item type is a valid Prototype. For example, 'wooden-chest' is not a valid item type for insertion.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `extract_item`: Attempts to extract a specified quantity of an item from a source. Ensure the source has enough items and the player's inventory has space.\n- `insert_item`: Inserts a specified quantity of an item into a target. Ensure the item type is valid.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `iron_ore_extracted`: Tracks the quantity of iron ore extracted, type: int.\n- `iron_ore_chest`: Represents the storage chest for iron ore, type: Entity.\n- `storage_chest`: Represents the general storage chest, type: Entity."}
