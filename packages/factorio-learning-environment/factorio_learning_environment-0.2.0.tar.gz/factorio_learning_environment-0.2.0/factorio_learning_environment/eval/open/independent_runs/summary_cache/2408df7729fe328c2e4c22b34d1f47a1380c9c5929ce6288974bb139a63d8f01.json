{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Boiler at position (-5.5, 24.0) with fuel inventory containing coal and full output status.\n- Steam Engine at position (-1.5, 24.5) with warnings indicating it is not connected to the power network and lacks input liquid.\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5) supplying water to the system.\n- PipeGroup connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine, with the fluid system ID 5457.\n\n### Copper Plate Production at Position (-19.0, -73.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -73.0) with a fuel inventory of coal but no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Iron Plate Production at Position (9.0, -64.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (9.0, -64.0) with a fuel inventory of coal but no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Additional Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (6.0, -62.0) with a fuel inventory of coal but no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Research Lab Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab with automation science packs but not receiving power.\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) not receiving electricity.\n- Wooden Chest at position (7.5, -61.5) and another at position (6.5, -59.5) for storage.\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Multiple small electric poles connecting various entities, but currently not supplying power due to lack of connection to the power network.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Reconnecting Boiler to Steam Engine\n- Ensure there are no placement blockages when connecting pipes between the boiler and steam engine. Clear any obstructing entities before attempting to connect.\n\n### Errors in Reconnecting Steam Engine to Inserter and Lab\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory, such as small electric poles, before attempting to reconnect electrical entities.\n\n### Steam Engine Not Generating Power\n- Verify that the steam engine is properly connected to both the power network and the fluid supply. Ensure there is sufficient steam input and the engine is not isolated from the power grid.\n\n### Inserter and Lab Not Receiving Electricity\n- Check the connections of small electric poles to ensure they form a complete circuit supplying power to the inserter and lab."}
