Check for obstructions and ensure the target tile is clear before attempting to place a chest.\n\n### Errors when clearing transport belts\n- Verify that the transport belts you intend to clear are not part of an essential transport system. Clearing belts may disrupt item flow, so ensure they are redundant or unnecessary before removal.\n\n### Errors when refueling entities\n- Ensure that the entity you are attempting to refuel is within reach and requires fuel. Check the current fuel status to avoid unnecessary refueling actions."}
