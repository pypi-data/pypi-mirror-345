{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nCurrently, there are no successfully constructed structures on the map. The agent has been attempting to place offshore pumps and boilers but has not succeeded in establishing any functional structures.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing offshore pumps and boilers\n- Ensure that the positions selected for placing offshore pumps and boilers are suitable and free from obstructions. Verify the terrain and space requirements before attempting to place these entities.\n  \n### Validation errors for BuildingBox\n- When specifying dimensions for entities like offshore pumps and boilers, ensure that the height and width are valid integers. Double-check the input types to avoid validation errors.\n\n### Incorrect use of API\n- Avoid using non-callable objects as functions. Ensure that objects like 'Position' are not mistakenly used as callable functions.\n  \n### Undefined functions\n- Make sure all functions, such as 'inspect_terrain', are defined and correctly implemented before calling them in the code. This will prevent runtime errors related to undefined functions."}
