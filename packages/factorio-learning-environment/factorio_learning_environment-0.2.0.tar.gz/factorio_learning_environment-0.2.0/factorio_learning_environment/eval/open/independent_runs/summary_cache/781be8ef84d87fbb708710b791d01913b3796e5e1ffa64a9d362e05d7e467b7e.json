The error indicates that a 'Chest' object is being used incorrectly. Verify the entity type and ensure it is callable or used in the correct context.\n\n### Errors due to full chests\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are full to prevent mining drills from halting operations. This will ensure continuous mining and production processes.\n\n### Errors due to inserters waiting for source items\n- Ensure that the source items are available for inserters to pick up. Monitor the supply chain to maintain a steady flow of resources to inserters."}
