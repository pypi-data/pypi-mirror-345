{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) with a warning of being out of fuel.\n- Stone Furnace at position (41.0, -80.0) with warnings of being out of fuel and lacking ingredients to smelt.\n- Wooden Chest at position (43.5, -79.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Mine at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) with a warning of being out of fuel.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5).\n\n### Copper Furnace at Position (-20.0, -71.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -71.0) with a warning of lacking ingredients to smelt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items without sufficient inventory\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities. This will prevent errors like \"Could not insert: No coal to insert from your inventory.\"\n\n### Timeout Errors\n- Monitor the execution time of your operations to avoid TimeoutErrors. Consider optimizing your code or breaking down tasks into smaller chunks to fit within time constraints.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `insert_item`: Used for inserting items into entities. Ensure that the inventory has the required items before calling this function to avoid errors.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `iron_furnace`: Represents the iron furnace entity where coal is inserted.\n- `copper_mining_drill`: Represents the copper mining drill entity where coal is inserted.\n- `iron_mining_drill`: Represents the iron mining drill entity where coal is inserted."}
