Several attempts were made to supply a Lab at (0.5, 2.5) by placing or crafting one, but all such actions failed. Although furnace entities were referenced for smelting operations (one at Position(x=5.0, y=5.0) for iron and another at Position(x=-27.0, y=-60.0) for copper), these were used solely for resource processing and do not constitute built composite structures within the scope of this report.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 API Parameter Usage \u2013 When using get_entities, ensure that the function is called with the correct parameters. Avoid using unexpected keyword arguments (such as 'radius') or providing positional arguments if none are expected.\n  \n\u2022 Inventory & Placement Validation \u2013 Verify that necessary items are available in inventory before attempting to place a structure. Ensure that the target location is valid and available to avoid placement errors.\n\n\u2022 Null Response Handling \u2013 Check that functions returning collections (for example, get_entities) do not return None before iterating. Use an empty list fallback to prevent TypeError situations when the expected iterable is missing.\n  \n\u2022 Recipe & Resource Sufficiency \u2013 Confirm that all required sub-ingredients and production prerequisites (e.g., for crafting a Lab, including items like iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, and copper-cables) are available in the needed quantities before initiating the craft. This helps avoid crafting failures due to resource shortages."}
