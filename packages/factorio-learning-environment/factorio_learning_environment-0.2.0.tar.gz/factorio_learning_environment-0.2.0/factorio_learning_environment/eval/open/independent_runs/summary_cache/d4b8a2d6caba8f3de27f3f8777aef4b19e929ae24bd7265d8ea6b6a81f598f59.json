{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n###Iron Smelting Area (Position x=0-6, y=0-4)\nConsists of multiple furnaces for smelting iron:\n- Stone furnace at position(0,0)\n- Stone furnace at position(2,0) \n- Stone furnace at position(4,4)\n- Stone furnace at position(6,4)\nCurrent status: No ingredients to smelt\n\n###Power Generation System (Position x=-9.5 to 4.5, y=21.5-27)\nSteam-based power generation setup consisting of:\n- Offshore pump at position(-9.5,24.5) - working, producing water\n- Pipe network connecting pump to boiler - contains water\n- Boiler at position(-2.5,24) - currently out of fuel\n- Steam engine at position(4.5,24.5) - not connected/no input liquid\n- Connected electric poles at positions(2.5,24.5) and (6.5,24.5)\n\n###Inserter Production Line (Position x=20.5-26.5, y=2.5)\nAutomated inserter assembly setup:\n- Input chest at position(20.5,2.5) \n- Burner inserter at position(21.5,2.5)\n- Assembling machine 1 at position(23.5,2.5) - currently no power\n- Burner inserter at position(25.5,2.5)\n- Output chest at position(26.5,2.5)\n\n###Research Lab Network\nMultiple labs connected to electricity network 142188:\n- Several labs with partial automation/logistic science packs\n- Some labs with no research in progress\n- Two labs without power connection\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Power system connection errors\n- Ensure steam engine is properly connected to power network\n- Make sure boiler has constant fuel supply\n- Verify fluid connections between boiler and steam engine are complete\n\n### Assembly line power issues\n- Connect assembling machines to power network\n- Ensure consistent power supply through proper pole placement\n\n### Resource shortage errors\n- Keep adequate iron plates in inventory before attempting to craft items\n- Maintain coal supply for boilers and burner inserters\n- Pre-craft required sub-components before attempting to make complex items\n\n### Crafting errors\n- Items requiring smelting (like iron plates) cannot be directly crafted - must use furnace\n- Ensure all recipe ingredients are available before starting assembly\n\n### Inventory management\n- Monitor coal levels for burner devices\n- Keep track of component materials needed for automated assembly"}
