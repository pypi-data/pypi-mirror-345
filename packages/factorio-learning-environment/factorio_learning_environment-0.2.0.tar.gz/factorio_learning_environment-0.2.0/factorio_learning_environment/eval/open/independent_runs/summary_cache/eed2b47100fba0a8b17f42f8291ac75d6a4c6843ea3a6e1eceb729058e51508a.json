{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Plate Production Structure at position(16.0, 71.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (16.0, 71.0)\n- Burner inserter at position (16.5, 73.5)\n- Stone furnace at position (17.0, 75.0)\n- Burner inserter at position (18.5, 75.5)\n- Belt group connecting the entities\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when placing entities next to each other\n- Ensure there is enough space to place an entity next to another entity. Consider increasing the spacing or changing the direction.\n\n#### Errors when connecting entities directly\n- Transport belts cannot be connected directly to certain entities like furnaces. Use an inserter that inputs or outputs items into or from the entity as the target.\n\n#### Common issues with entity placement\n- Check for nearby entities that might be blocking the placement.\n- Ensure the area where you are trying to place an entity is not water or another unbuildable terrain.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\nNo utility functions have been defined by the agent in the given logs. Hence, this section is not included."}
