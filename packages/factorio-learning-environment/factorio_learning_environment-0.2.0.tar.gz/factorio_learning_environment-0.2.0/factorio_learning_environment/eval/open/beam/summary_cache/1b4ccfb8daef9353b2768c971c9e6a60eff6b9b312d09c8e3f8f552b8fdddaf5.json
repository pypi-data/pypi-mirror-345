{"content": "Great! You've successfully crafted the iron gear wheel needed for the offshore pump. Now, let's proceed to craft the remaining components: electronic circuits and pipes.\n\n### Steps to Craft Remaining Components:\n\n1. **Craft Electronic Circuits:**\n   - **Ingredients Needed:** Iron plates and copper cables.\n   - Since you have copper plates, craft copper cables first.\n\n2. **Craft Pipes:**\n   - **Ingredients Needed:** Iron plates.\n\n### Implementation:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Craft Copper Cables\nrequired_copper_cables = 2  # Needed for electronic circuits\ncopper_cables_crafted = craft_item(Prototype.CopperCable, quantity=required_copper_cables)\nassert copper_cables_crafted >= required_copper_cables, \"Failed to craft sufficient copper cables.\"\n\n# Step 2: Craft Electronic Circuits\nrequired_electronic_circuits = 2\nelectronic_circuits_crafted = craft_item(Prototype.ElectronicCircuit, quantity=required_electronic_circuits)\nassert electronic_circuits_crafted >= required_electronic_circuits, \"Failed to craft sufficient electronic circuits.\"\n\n# Step 3: Craft Pipes\nrequired_pipes = 1\npipes_crafted = craft_item(Prototype.Pipe, quantity=required_pipes)\nassert pipes_crafted >= required_pipes, \"Failed to craft sufficient pipes.\"\n\n# Check the updated inventory\nprint(f\"Updated Inventory: {inspect_inventory()}\")\n\n# Now, attempt to craft the Offshore Pump\noffshore_pump_crafted = craft_item(Prototype.OffshorePump, quantity=1)\nassert offshore_pump_crafted == 1, \"Failed to craft the offshore pump.\"\n\n# Verify the final inventory\nprint(f\"Final Inventory after crafting Offshore Pump: {inspect_inventory()}\")\n```\n\n### Tips:\n- Always ensure you have enough raw materials before crafting intermediate items.\n- Use assertions to validate successful crafting, which helps in debugging if something goes wrong.\n- Keep track of your inventory to avoid crafting unnecessary items and wasting resources.", "summary_range": "[1-136]"}
