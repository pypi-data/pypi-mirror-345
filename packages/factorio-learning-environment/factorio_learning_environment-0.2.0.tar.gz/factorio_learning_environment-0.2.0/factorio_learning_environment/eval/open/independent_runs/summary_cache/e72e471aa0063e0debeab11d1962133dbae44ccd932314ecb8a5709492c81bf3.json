{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at Position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) which extracts iron ore and drops it into a chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) which stores the extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) which is intended to transfer iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0) which is supposed to smelt the iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Misalignment and Functionality Issues\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items from the chest to the furnace. Repeated repositioning indicates persistent alignment issues.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Iron Ore\n- Verify that the inserter is operational and correctly configured to deliver iron ore to the furnace. Check the inserter's fuel status and ensure it is not out of fuel.\n\n### Chest Management\n- Regularly monitor and manage the chest inventory to prevent it from becoming full, which can halt the mining operation. Extract items from the chest to maintain space for new resources.\n\n### Fuel Management for Entities\n- Ensure that all fuel-dependent entities like the burner mining drill, inserter, and furnace are adequately refueled to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Warnings and Status Checks\n- Address any warnings such as \"chest at drop position is full\" and \"no ingredients to smelt\" promptly to ensure smooth operation of all entities."}
