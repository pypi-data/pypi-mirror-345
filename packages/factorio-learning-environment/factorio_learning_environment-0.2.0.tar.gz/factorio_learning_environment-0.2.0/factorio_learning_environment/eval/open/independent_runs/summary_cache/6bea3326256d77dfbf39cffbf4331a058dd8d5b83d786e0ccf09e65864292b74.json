{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, y=-49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, y=-49.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Inserter at position (54.5, y=-83.5) transferring items from the chest at position (56.5, y=-83.5).\n\n### Mining and Resource Collection System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (40.0, y=-84.0) extracting resources, with output directed to a wooden chest at position (41.5, y=-83.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (41.5, y=-83.5) storing resources extracted by the mining drill.\n- Burner Inserter at position (41.5, y=-80.5) managing resource transfer.\n\n### Transport and Logistics System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- BeltGroup with inputs and outputs facilitating coal transport, consisting of belts at various positions, including:\n  - Belt from position (50.5, y=-86.5) to (48.5, y=-86.5), direction LEFT.\n  - Belt from position (49.5, y=-86.5) to (47.5, y=-86.5), direction LEFT.\n  - Additional belts at positions (43.5, y=-84.5) to (45.5, y=-84.5) and (45.5, y=-85.5) to (47.5, y=-85.5), direction RIGHT.\n  - Belt at position (52.5, y=-83.5) to (52.5, y=-85.5), direction UP.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Mining Drill Output Blockage\n- Ensure that the output of mining drills is not blocked by items on the ground. Regularly clear any items obstructing the output path to maintain efficient resource extraction.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Operations\n- Verify that inserters have a clear path to transfer items between entities. Ensure that source and destination entities are correctly aligned and accessible.\n\n### Errors with Resource Management\n- Monitor resource levels in furnaces and inserters to prevent production halts. Regularly supply necessary resources such as coal and iron ore to maintain continuous operation."}
