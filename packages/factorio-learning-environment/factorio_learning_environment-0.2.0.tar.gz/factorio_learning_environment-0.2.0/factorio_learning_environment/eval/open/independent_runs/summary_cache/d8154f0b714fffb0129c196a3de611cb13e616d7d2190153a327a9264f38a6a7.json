The quantity to extract must be greater than 0.\n\n### Errors when Chests are Full\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are full to prevent mining and production processes from halting. Ensure that there is available space in the destination chest before transferring items.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entity has items available for the inserter to pick up. Regularly refuel inserters and ensure they are correctly positioned to pick up items from the source."}
