{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-10.5, 23.0)\nConsists of:\n- Boiler at position (-10.5, 23.0)\n- Steam engine at position (-13.5, 24.5)\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace at position (15.0, 0.0) fueled by coal\n- Wooden chest at position (5.5, 0.5) containing iron ore\n- Inserters at positions (16.5, 0.5) and (17.5, 0.5) for moving items between the chest and the furnace\n- Small electric pole at position (17.5, -0.5) to provide power to inserters\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- PipeGroup at position (-1.5, 17.5) with multiple pipes connecting various positions\n- PipeGroup at position (1.5, 17.5) with multiple pipes connecting various positions\n- PipeGroup at position (-6.5, 20.5) with a single pipe\n\n### Electricity Network\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at multiple positions including (17.5, -0.5), (15.5, 2.5), (16.5, 8.5), and others\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Entity Position Attributes\n- Ensure that the 'Position' object is correctly referenced when accessing attributes like 'position' or 'connection_points'. Double-check the API documentation for proper usage.\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities Too Far\n- Move closer to the target position before attempting to place entities. The maximum placement distance is 10 units.\n\n### Errors with Inventory Management\n- Verify that the required entities are available in the inventory before attempting to place them. Ensure you have crafted or collected the necessary items.\n\n### Errors with Pipe Placement\n- Adjust the positioning of pipes and underground pipes to ensure they fit within the intended layout. Consider alternative paths if placement fails.\n\n### Connection Errors in Power and Fluid Systems\n- Ensure all components like boilers, steam engines, and offshore pumps are properly connected to each other and to the power network. Check for any missing connections or misaligned components."}
