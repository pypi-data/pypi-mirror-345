{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Line at (-2.0, -76.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-2.0, -76.0) connected to\n- Stone furnace at (-1.0, -74.0) with\n- Burner inserter at (0.5, -74.5)\n- Iron chest at (0.5, -72.5) storing iron plates\nCurrent status: Mining drill working but output blocked, furnace has no ingredients, contains 55 iron plates\n\n### Copper Ore Processing Line at (-21.0, -73.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-21.0, -73.0)\n- Iron chest at (-21.5, -74.5) storing copper ore\n- Burner inserter at (-20.5, -74.5)\n- Stone furnace at (-19.0, -74.0)\nCurrent status: Mining drill working, chest contains 49 copper ore, furnace contains 100 copper plates\n\n### Furnace Array at (3.0, -73.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace at (3.0, -73.0)\n- Stone furnace at (5.0, -73.0)\n- Burner inserter at (1.5, -72.5)\n- Burner inserter at (6.5, -72.5)\n- Iron chest at (3.5, -71.5)\n- Iron chest at (7.5, -72.5) containing 18 iron plates\nCurrent status: Furnaces have no ingredients but are fueled\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with belt connections\n- When using connect_entities function, ensure both source and target entities are properly initialized and have valid tile_dimensions attribute\n- Verify that entities exist and are properly placed before attempting to connect them with belts\n- Double check that the connect_entities function is receiving valid entity objects as parameters\n\n### Entity placement and blocking issues\n- Multiple entities have \"output blocked\" warnings - ensure there is proper space and receiving entities for outputs\n- When placing inserters, verify there is a clear path for item pickup and dropping\n- Plan the layout to avoid blocking situations where items have nowhere to go\n\n### Resource flow optimization needed\n- Several furnaces show \"no ingredients to smelt\" - ensure proper input logistics\n- Consider improving the material transport system between miners, storage, and furnaces"}
