{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System at position(-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of offshore pump (position x=-9.5, y=-0.5), boiler (position x=-5.0, y=2.5), steam engine (position x=0.5, y=6.5), and connecting pipes. The system is partially operational with the boiler now containing 40 coal units. The offshore pump is working and producing water, but there are connection issues between components. The steam engine has warnings about not being connected to the power network and no input liquid, resulting in no electricity being generated for the factory.\n\n### Iron Mining and Smelting at position(19.5, 74.5)\nConsists of following entities:\n- Electric mining drill (position x=19.5, y=74.5) extracting iron ore\n- Stone furnace (position x=20.0, y=78.0) for smelting iron plates\n- Inserter (position x=19.5, y=76.5) that moves ore from drill to furnace\n- Output inserter (position x=21.5, y=78.5) that takes iron plates from furnace\n- Small electric pole (position x=21.5, y=76.5) for power\n- Transport belt (position x=22.5, y=78.5) for moving iron plates\nThe system is currently not operational due to lack of power. The furnace has 40 coal units but is waiting for ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Copper Mining and Smelting at position(-49.5, 81.5)\nConsists of following entities:\n- Electric mining drill (position x=-49.5, y=81.5) extracting copper ore\n- Stone furnace (position x=-49.0, y=85.0) for smelting copper plates\n- Inserter (position x=-49.5, y=83.5) that moves ore from drill to furnace\n- Output inserter (position x=-47.5, y=85.5) that takes copper plates from furnace\n- Small electric pole (position x=-47.5, y=83.5) for power\nThe system is currently not operational due to lack of power. The furnace has 40 coal units but is waiting for ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Coal Mining at position(22.0, 18.0)\nConsists of following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position x=22.0, y=18.0) extracting coal\n- Wooden chest (position x=22.5, y=19.5) for collecting coal, currently contains 748 coal\nThe drill is working after being refueled with additional coal (now has 15 coal units).\n\n### Temporary Smelting Area at position(0.0, 140.0)\nConsists of following entities:\n- Temporary iron furnace (position x=0.0, y=140.0) with coal fuel (21 remaining), currently contains 3 iron plates\n- Temporary copper furnace (position x=10.0, y=140.0) with coal fuel (30 remaining), currently contains 3 copper plates\nBoth furnaces are waiting for ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Iron Gear Production at position(0.5, 150.5)\nConsists of following entities:\n- Assembling machine 2 (position x=0.5, y=150.5) set to craft iron gear wheels\n- Input chest (position x=-3.5, y=150.5) for iron plates, currently contains 10 iron plates\n- Input inserter (position x=-2.5, y=150.5) that moves iron from chest to belt\n- Transport belt system connecting components\n- Input inserter (position x=-1.5, y=149.5) that moves iron from belt to assembler\n- Output inserter (position x=2.5, y=150.5) that takes gears from assembler to belt\n- Transport belt (position x=3.5, y=150.5) for moving gears\nThe system is not operational due to lack of power. The belt system has been repeatedly adjusted but still has configuration issues.\n\n### Science Pack Production at position(10.5, 150.5)\nConsists of following entities:\n- Assembling machine 2 (position x=10.5, y=150.5) set to craft automation science packs\n- Input transport belt system bringing copper plates and iron gears\n- Output inser"}
