{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, -0.5)\n- Boiler at position (-6.0, -0.5)\n- Steam Engine at position (-2.5, -0.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting the offshore pump to the boiler with pipes at positions [(-6.5, -2.5), (-7.5, -2.5), (-8.5, -0.5), (-7.5, -1.5), (-7.5, -0.5)]\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Operation\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Electric Mining Drill at position (15.5, 70.5) with a wooden chest at position (15.5, 72.5) for collecting iron ore\n- Electric Mining Drill at position (18.5, 70.5) with a wooden chest at position (18.5, 72.5) for collecting iron ore\n- ElectricityGroup providing power to the mining drills\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Electrical Entities\n- Ensure that the entities you are trying to connect are within the connection range of the Small Electric Pole. Verify the positions and ensure there are no obstructions.\n\n### Errors in Finding Nearest Entities\n- When using functions to find the nearest entity, ensure that the entity type exists on the map. If not, place the required entity first before attempting to find it.\n\n### Errors when Connecting Fluid Entities\n- Verify that there are no obstructions between the source and target entities. Ensure that the connection points are not blocked and that the target can receive fluid from the source.\n\n### Undefined Function Usage\n- Before using a function, ensure it is defined in your script. If you encounter a NameError, check for typos or define the function if it is missing.\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities at a Distance\n- Move closer to the target position before attempting to place an entity. Ensure the distance is within the permissible range for placement.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Defined Functions\n- `get_entity(entity: Any, position: Any) -> Any`: Retrieves an entity at a specified position.\n- `rotate_entity(entity: Any, direction: Any) -> Any`: Rotates an entity in the specified direction.\n- `pickup_entity(entity: Any, position: Any) -> Any`: Picks up an entity from a specified position.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `power_source_position: Position`: Intended to store the position of a power source, but failed due to a missing steam engine.\n- `pipes_to_steam_engine: List[Pipe]`: Intended to store the connection between the boiler and steam engine, but failed due to blocked connection points."}
