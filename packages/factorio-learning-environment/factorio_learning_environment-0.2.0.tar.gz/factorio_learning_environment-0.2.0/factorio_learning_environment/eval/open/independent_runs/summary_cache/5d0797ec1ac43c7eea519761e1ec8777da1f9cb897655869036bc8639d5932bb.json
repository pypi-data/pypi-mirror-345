{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Operation at (15.5,70.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill at (15.5,70.5) extracting iron ore\n- Stone furnace at (16.0,74.0) for smelting\n- Burner inserter at (14.5,73.5) feeding coal into furnace\n\n### Power Generation System at (-9.5,-2.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5,-2.5) collecting water\n- Boiler at (-3.0,-2.5) converting water to steam\n- Pipe network connecting pump to boiler\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Placement errors on water tiles\n- Cannot place boilers or steam engines on water tiles (-4.0,0.5), (-7.5,-0.5), (-1.0,-2.5)\n- Always check terrain type before placing entities, especially near water sources\n\n### Fluid connection failures\n- Failed to connect offshore pump at (-9.5,-0.5) to boiler at (-3.0,-2.5) due to excessive distance\n- Ensure fluid connections are within reasonable distance and have clear path\n- Consider using pipe-to-ground for longer distances\n\n### Power issues\n- Electric mining drill at (15.5,70.5) not receiving power despite being connected to grid\n- Verify power production is sufficient and properly connected to consumers\n- Check that steam engines are properly placed and fueled\n\n### Entity placement conflicts\n- Multiple attempts to place entities where other entities already exist\n- Always verify target location is clear before placement attempts"}
