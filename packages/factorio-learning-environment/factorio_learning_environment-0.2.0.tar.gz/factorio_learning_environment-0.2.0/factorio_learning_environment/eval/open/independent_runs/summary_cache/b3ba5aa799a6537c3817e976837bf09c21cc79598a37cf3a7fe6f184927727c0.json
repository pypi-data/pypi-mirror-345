{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Complex at (-10, -59)\nComplex mining setup consisting of:\n- Three burner mining drills at positions (-10.0, -59.0), (-8.0, -59.0), (-6.0, -59.0)\n- Collection chests at (-9.5, -57.5), (-7.5, -57.5), (-5.5, -57.5)\n- Multiple burner inserters for material movement at (-7.5, -56.5), (-6.5, -57.5), (-5.5, -56.5), (-4.5, -57.5)\n- Transport belt system connecting the components\n\n### Iron Smelting Line at (-27, -59)\nSmelting setup with:\n- Furnaces at (-27.0, -59.0), (-23.0, -58.0), (-21.0, -58.0)\n- Burner inserters at (-25.5, -58.5), (-20.5, -59.5), (-22.5, -56.5)\n- Output chest at (-24.5, -58.5) containing iron and copper plates\n- Storage chest at (-22.5, -55.5) for iron plates\n\n### Main Smelting Array (0, 0)\nLarge smelting array consisting of:\n- Four furnaces at (0.0, 0.0), (2.0, 0.0), (4.0, 0.0), (6.0, 0.0)\n- Input chests at (0.5, -2.5), (2.5, -2.5), (4.5, -2.5), (6.5, -2.5)\n- Output chests at (0.5, 2.5), (2.5, 2.5), (4.5, 2.5), (6.5, 2.5)\n- Multiple burner inserters for input at (0.5, -1.5), (2.5, -1.5), (4.5, -1.5), (6.5, -1.5)\n- Multiple burner inserters for output at (0.5, 1.5), (2.5, 1.5), (4.5, 1.5), (6.5, 1.5)\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with fuel management\n- Ensure sufficient coal is available in inventory before attempting to insert fuel into entities\n- Keep track of fuel levels in mining drills to prevent them from stopping\n\n### Entity placement and workflow issues\n- Output is blocked in some mining drills - ensure proper connection to transport system or storage\n- Some inserters are waiting for source items - verify the supply chain is properly connected\n- Some furnaces have no ingredients - check if input transport system is working correctly\n\n### Belt system optimization needed\n- Multiple belt groups show empty status - verify proper connections between belt segments\n- Ensure belts are properly oriented to maintain continuous flow of materials\n\n### Space management\n- Some inserters are waiting for space in destination - ensure output storage has sufficient capacity\n- Check for blocked outputs that may be causing backups in the production line"}
