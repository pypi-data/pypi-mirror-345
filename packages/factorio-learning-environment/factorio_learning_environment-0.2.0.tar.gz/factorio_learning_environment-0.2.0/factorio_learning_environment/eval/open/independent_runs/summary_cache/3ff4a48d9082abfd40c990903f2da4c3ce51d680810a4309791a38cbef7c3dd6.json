{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Iron plate production facility at position(0,0)\nConsists of stone furnaces at positions (0,0) and (4,0), a burner inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) and a wooden chest at position (6.5, 0.5)\n\n### Logistic Science Pack Assembling Machine at position(10.5, 10.5)\nConsists of an assembling machine at position (10.5, 10.5), three burner inserters at positions (10.5, 8.5), (8.5, 10.5), and (12.5, 10.5), and two wooden chests at positions (7.5, 10.5) and (13.5, 10.5)\n\n### Power Generation System at position(-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of an offshore pump at position (-9.5, -0.5), a boiler at position (-7.5, 0.0), a steam engine at position (-2.5, 3.5), and a pipe group attempting to connect the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine. The pipe connections are currently not established.\n\n### Electricity Distribution System\nConsists of small electric poles at positions (3.5, 3.5), (-0.5, 3.5), (9.5, 8.5), (8.5, 6.5), and (6.5, 4.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n### Errors when connecting power\n- Ensure that the entities are correctly positioned and that there are no obstacles in the way of the power connection.\n### Errors when using undefined variables\n- Ensure that all variables are defined before using them. \n### Errors when calling functions are without checking preconditions\n- Check if a research is in progress before calling `get_research_progress()`\n### Errors when placing entities too far away\n- Move closer to the target position before attempting to place an entity.\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied positions\n- Ensure that the target position is not occupied by another entity before attempting to place an entity. Consider increasing the spacing, changing the direction or changing the reference position.\n### Errors when inserter is waiting for source items\n- Ensure that the inserter's pickup position has the required items to transfer to the drop position.\n### Errors when supplying assembling machine with ingredients\n- Ensure that the required ingredients are available and that the inserters are correctly configured to supply the assembling machine.\n### Errors when using undefined names\n- Ensure that all names are defined before using them.\n### Errors when list index is out of range\n- Check the length of the list before attempting to access an index.\n### Errors when connecting offshore pump to boiler\n- Ensure that the pipe connection points between the offshore pump and boiler are not blocked by other entities.\n### Errors when creating power generation system\n- Ensure that the offshore pump and boiler are correctly positioned and connected.\n### Errors when connecting steam engine to assembling machine\n- Ensure that the steam engine is producing power and that the power poles are correctly connected to the assembling machine.\n### Errors when analyzing pipe connections\n- Ensure that there are no entities blocking the pipe connection points between the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n### Function signature: `Pipeline(...)` \nDescription: The function is not defined, but it seems to be related to creating a pipeline.\nFailure mode: `NameError: name 'Pipeline' is not defined`\nSuccess mode: Not observed\nImportant variables: \n- `pipe`: type not defined, possibly related to pipe entities\n- `pipe-to-ground`: type not defined, possibly related to pipe-to-ground entities\n\nNo other utility functions have been defined by the agent."}
