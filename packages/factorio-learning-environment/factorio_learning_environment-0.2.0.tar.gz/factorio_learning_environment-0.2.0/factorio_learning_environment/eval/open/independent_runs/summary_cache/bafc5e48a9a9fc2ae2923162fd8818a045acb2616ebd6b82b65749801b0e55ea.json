{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron ore mine at position(x=-15.5, y=-50.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position x=41.0, y=-82.0) which is currently working and extracting iron ore.\n- Furnace (position x=-15.0, y=-50.0) which is currently processing iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Wooden chest at position(x=41.5, y=-80.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest (position x=41.5, y=-80.5) which contains coal and is being used to supply coal to the burner mining drill.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n- **Errors when extracting from the wooden chest while it is full**\n  - Ensure to monitor the inventory of the wooden chest. If it is full, empty it before attempting to extract more items.\n  \n- **Errors when inserting items into the furnace**\n  - Make sure that the furnace has enough space to accept the items being inserted. If the furnace is full, it cannot accept more iron ore.\n\n- **Errors when using extracting but being too far**\n  - Move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n- **Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity**\n  - Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- **Utility Functions Defined:**\n  - None noted in the execution logs.\n\n- **Important Variables Assigned:**\n  - `iron-ore`: int\n  - `coal`: int\n  - `wood`: int\n  - `iron-plate`: int\n  - `burner-mining-drill`: object\n  - `furnace`: object\n  - `wooden-chest`: object"}
