{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Copper plate mine at position(x=41.0, y=-82.0)\nConsists of a burner mining drill at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0) and a stone furnace at position (x=41.0, y=-80.0)\n\n### Offshore pump at position(x=106.5, y=-32.5)\nConsists of an offshore pump at position (x=106.5, y=-32.5) connected to a pipe group with fluid system 163653\n\n### Boiler at position(x=111.5, y=-32.0)\nConsists of a boiler at position (x=111.5, y=-32.0) connected to a pipe group with fluid system 163653\n\n### Steam engine at position(x=117.5, y=-30.5)\nConsists of a steam engine at position (x=117.5, y=-30.5) connected to a pipe group and an electricity group with id 586766\n\n### Electricity network\nConsists of an electricity group with id 586766, including poles at positions (x=115.5, y=-30.5), (x=111.5, y=-27.5), (x=120.5, y=-26.5), (x=115.5, y=-32.5), (x=111.5, y=-30.5), and (x=112.5, y=-24.5)\n\n### Furnace at position(x=60.0, y=-60.0)\nConsists of a stone furnace at position (x=60.0, y=-60.0)\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n### Errors when using connect_entities function\n- Ensure that the correct number of arguments is passed to the connect_entities function. The function takes 3 positional arguments, but 5 were given in some cases.\n- Make sure to pass the correct type of arguments to the connect_entities function. The function expects Position objects, but float objects were passed in some cases.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into a furnace\n- Ensure that there is enough coal in the inventory to insert into the furnace. An error occurred when trying to insert coal into a furnace with no coal in the inventory.\n\n### Errors when accessing Position objects\n- Make sure to access the correct attributes of Position objects. An error occurred when trying to access the 'position' attribute of a Position object, which does not exist.\n\n# NAMESPACE\n- `connect_entities`: a function that connects entities with transport belts. It has been invoked multiple times, but has failed due to incorrect arguments.\n- `insert_item`: a function that inserts items into a furnace. It has been invoked multiple times, but has failed due to lack of coal in the inventory.\n- `Position`: a class that represents a position on the map. It has been used to access positions of entities, but has failed due to incorrect attribute access.\n- Important variables:\n  - `drill`: a BurnerMiningDrill entity\n  - `furnace`: a Furnace entity\n  - `coal_in_inventory`: the amount of coal in the inventory\n  - `Prototype.TransportBelt`: a Prototype object representing a transport belt\n  - `Prototype.Coal`: a Prototype object representing coal"}
