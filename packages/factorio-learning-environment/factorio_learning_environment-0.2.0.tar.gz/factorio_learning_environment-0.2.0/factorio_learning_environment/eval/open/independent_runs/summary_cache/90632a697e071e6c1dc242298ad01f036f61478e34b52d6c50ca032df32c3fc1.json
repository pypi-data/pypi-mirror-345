{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=41.0, y=-80.0)\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0) connected to a Stone Furnace at position (x=-20.0, y=-71.0)\n\n### Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=43.5, y=-79.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to insufficient inventory items\n- Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities. For example, attempting to insert coal into furnaces without having coal in the inventory resulted in errors.\n\n### Errors when entities run out of fuel\n- Regularly check the fuel levels of entities like Burner Mining Drills and Stone Furnaces to prevent them from running out of fuel and halting production.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `insert_item`: Attempts to insert a specified quantity of an item into a target entity. Ensure that the item is present in the inventory before calling this function.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `copper_furnace`: Represents a furnace intended for copper processing.\n- `iron_furnace`: Represents a furnace intended for iron processing."}
