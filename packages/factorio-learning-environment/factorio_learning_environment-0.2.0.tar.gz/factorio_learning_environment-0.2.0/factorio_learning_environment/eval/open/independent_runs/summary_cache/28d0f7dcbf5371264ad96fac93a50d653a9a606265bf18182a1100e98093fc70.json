{"content": "I'll generate a report based on the provided execution logs:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n###Coal Mining and Transport System at position(41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (position 41.0, -82.0) mining coal\n- Wooden chest (position 41.5, -80.5) collecting coal\n- Burner inserter (position 42.5, -80.5) \n- Belt group spanning from (42.5, -81.5) to (43.5, -81.5)\n- Stone furnace (position 45.0, -81.0)\n\nCurrent status: The mining drill is working and outputting to the chest. The inserter is waiting for space in destination. The belt group is empty and the furnace has no ingredients.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Conflicts\n- Check for existing entities before placing new ones - multiple attempts to place inserters and belts failed due to occupied spaces\n- Ensure target location is valid terrain (not water) before attempting to place entities\n\n### Belt and Inserter Configuration\n- When configuring inserter-belt systems, ensure:\n  - Inserter drop positions align with belt inputs\n  - Inserter pickup positions align with source containers\n  - Belt segments are properly connected in sequence\n\n### Code Structure Issues\n- BeltGroup object doesn't have a 'direction' attribute - use individual belt properties instead\n- Verify entity attributes exist before accessing them\n\n### Output Blocking\n- Ensure there are valid sink entities (like chests or machines) at inserter drop locations to prevent output blocking\n- Configure inserter drop positions to valid destinations before activating them\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nFunctions:\n- place_entity() - Places entities on the map\n  Success: When placement location is clear and valid\n  Failure: When location is occupied or invalid (water)\n\nImportant Variables:\n- first_inserter: BurnerInserter\n- second_inserter: BurnerInserter\n- belt: BeltGroup\n- drill: BurnerMiningDrill\n- chest: Chest\n- furnace: Furnace"}
