    Starwars characters dataset.

    ## Description

    A dataset containing information on Star Wars characters, originally sourced from SWAPI 
    (https://swapi.py4e.com/) and subsequently revised to reflect additional research into 
    the gender and sex determinations of characters.

    This dataset is structured as a tibble (data frame) with 87 rows and 14 variables.
