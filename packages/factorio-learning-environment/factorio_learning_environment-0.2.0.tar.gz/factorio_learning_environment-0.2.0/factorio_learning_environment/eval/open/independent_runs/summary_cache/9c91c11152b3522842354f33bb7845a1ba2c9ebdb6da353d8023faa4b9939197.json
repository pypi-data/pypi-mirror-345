{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n###Iron Smelting Setup at position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of two furnaces:\n- First furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Second furnace at position (2.0, 0.0)\nBoth furnaces have coal as fuel (23 each) and contain 11 iron plates in result slot, but currently have no ingredients to smelt.\n\n###Copper Mining and Smelting Setup at position(-28.0, -61.0)\nConsists of:\n- First burner mining drill at position (-28.0, -61.0), rotated downward, fueled with 27 coal\n- Second burner mining drill at position (-26.0, -61.0), rotated downward, fueled with 17 coal\n- First furnace at position (-27.0, -59.0) with 18 coal as fuel, contains 10 copper plates\n- Second furnace at position (-25.0, -59.0) with 18 coal as fuel, contains 11 iron plates\n- Collection wooden chest at position (-25.5, -56.5)\n- Burner inserter at position (-26.5, -57.5), fueled with 9 coal, moving items from chest to first furnace\n- Burner inserter at position (-24.5, -57.5), unfueled, moving items from chest to second furnace\nBoth drills are operational but blocked due to full output storage.\n\nERROR TIPS\n### Errors when trying to place entities without having them in inventory\n- Before attempting to place entities (burner mining drills, furnaces), ensure they are available in the inventory\n- If needed items are not in inventory, craft them first using required materials\n- Check inventory contents before placement attempts\n\n### Errors related to entity fuel status\n- Remember to fuel burner mining drills after placement\n- Add fuel (coal) to burner mining drills before expecting them to operate\n- Verify you have coal in your inventory before attempting to insert fuel into entities\n\n### Errors when placing entities too far from player position\n- Maximum placement distance is 10 units from player position\n- Move closer to the target location before attempting to place entities\n- Calculate distance between current position and target position before placement\n\n### Errors when placing entities in invalid locations\n- Ensure the target location is suitable for the entity being placed\n- Check if the drop position of mining drills is valid for furnace placement\n- Consider the tile dimensions of entities when planning placement positions\n- When placing inserters next to entities, ensure there is enough space and no collisions with existing structures\n\n### Errors related to blocked output\n- Mining drills become blocked when their output location is full\n- Place appropriate storage or transport systems (like chests or belts) at the drop positions\n- For the current setup, place sink objects at (-27.5, -59.5) and (-25.5, -59.5) to prevent blockage\n\n### Errors related to inserter placement\n- When using place_entity_next_to, verify there is sufficient space considering the target entity's dimensions\n- Adjust spacing parameter if default spacing results in collision with existing entities\n- Consider alternative directions if the desired placement position is blocked\n\n### Errors related to inserter operation\n- Ensure inserters have fuel before expecting them to operate\n- Keep track of coal in inventory before attempting to fuel inserters\n- Monitor inserter fuel levels to prevent operation interruption"}
