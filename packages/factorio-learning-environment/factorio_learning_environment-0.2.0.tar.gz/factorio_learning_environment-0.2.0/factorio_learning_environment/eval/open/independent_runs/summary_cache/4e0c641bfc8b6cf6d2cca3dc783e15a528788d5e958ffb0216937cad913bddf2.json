{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-46.5, -119.0)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-46.5, -119.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (-40.5, -113.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-15.0, -76.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at Position (-15.5, -77.5)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-19.0, -73.0)\n\n### Copper Plate Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0)\n\n### Research Lab Setup\nConsists of:\n- Lab at Position (6.5, -60.5)\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) connected to the Lab\n- Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5) and (6.5, -59.5) for storage\n\n### Pipe Network\n- Multiple PipeGroups across various positions for fluid transport\n\n### Electricity Network\n- Small Electric Poles at various positions providing power distribution\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Accessing Non-Existent Entities\n- Ensure that the entity type and position are correct before attempting to access them. Use `get_entity` with valid parameters.\n\n### Name Errors in Code\n- Verify that all variables and classes are correctly defined and imported. Use the correct class names and ensure all necessary modules are imported.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Not Receiving Power\n- Ensure that inserters are connected to a power network. Check the connections and ensure that the power poles are correctly placed and connected.\n\n### Errors Due to Full Inventory or Lack of Ingredients\n- Regularly check the inventory of chests and furnaces to prevent overflow or shortages. Ensure that resources are being supplied to entities that require them for processing."}
