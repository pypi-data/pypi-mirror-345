{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo new structures have been successfully created on the map. Repeated attempts to craft and place a Lab at position (0.5, 2.5) for supplying Automation Science Packs have not succeeded due to inventory shortages and crafting failures. No additional agent\u2010assembled structures are present.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 API Parameter Errors for get_entities()\n  \u2013 Use the exact parameter conventions supported by the API. Avoid unexpected keyword arguments (such as \u201cradius\u201d) and supplying positional arguments if the function expects none.\n\u2022 Lab Placement and Inventory Issues\n  \u2013 Confirm that the lab item exists in inventory before attempting placement.\n\u2022 Handling of None Returns\n  \u2013 Check results from functions like get_entities() and default to an empty list when the returned value is None to avoid iteration errors.\n\u2022 Crafting Chain Prerequisites for Lab\n  \u2013 Ensure that all intermediary ingredients (for example, iron-gear-wheels, electronic circuits, copper cables, and copper plates) are available through proper smelting and crafting processes before starting lab production.\n\u2022 Missing Resource Shortages\n  \u2013 Verify that production targets for essential items (such as additional iron-gear-wheels) are met to fulfill the complete recipe requirements for lab crafting.\n\n"}
