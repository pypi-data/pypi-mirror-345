{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0)\n  - Fuel: 2 units of coal\n  - Status: Working\n  - Warnings: Output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Neighbours: Stone Furnace at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)\n  - Drop Position: (x=-16.5, y=-52.5)\n  - Resources: 40,000 units of iron ore\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)\n  - Fuel: 10 units of coal\n  - Status: Working\n  - Warnings: Furnace result is full\n  - Furnace Source: 1 unit of iron ore\n  - Furnace Result: 100 units of iron plate\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied locations\n- Ensure the target tile is free before attempting to place entities such as Wooden Chests, Transport Belts, Burner Inserters, and Stone Furnaces.\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities\n- Verify the existence and correct positioning of entities before attempting to retrieve them. This includes ensuring that the specified position is accurate and that the entity type matches the expected prototype.\n\n### Errors when using incorrect API arguments\n- Double-check the arguments passed to API functions to ensure they match the expected parameters. For example, avoid using unsupported keyword arguments like 'quantity' in functions that do not accept them.\n\n### Errors due to blocked outputs\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity in place to accept outputs from production entities like Burner Mining Drills to prevent blockage warnings.\n\n### Errors when inserting items\n- Confirm that the item being inserted is of the correct type and quantity expected by the receiving entity to avoid exceptions related to incorrect arguments."}
