{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n--------------------\nNo new structures were successfully created on the map in these steps. Multiple attempts were made to establish a Lab at (0.5, 2.5) for supplying Automation Science Packs to research, but placement never succeeded due to inventory and crafting shortfalls. No additional building or production structures were placed during this session.\n\nERROR TIPS\n----------\n\u2022 Incorrect API Usage for Entity Retrieval  \n\u2003\u2013 Calling get_entities with a keyword argument (e.g. radius=5) or with extra positional arguments led to type errors.  \n\u2003\u2013 Tip: Verify the function\u2019s signature and use only the supported parameters when retrieving entities.\n\n\u2022 Iteration Over None Values  \n\u2003\u2013 Attempting to iterate over a None result (from get_entities) caused a TypeError.  \n\u2003\u2013 Tip: Check that returned values are valid iterables; if None is received, default to an empty list.\n\n\u2022 Lab Placement Validation  \n\u2003\u2013 Attempts to place a Lab at (0.5, 2.5) failed because no Lab was available in the inventory.  \n\u2003\u2013 Tip: Confirm resource availability (including the Lab item itself) before attempting placement.\n\n\u2022 Lab Crafting Dependencies  \n\u2003\u2013 Lab crafting errors occurred because required sub-ingredients (such as iron-gear-wheels and electronic circuits) were missing due to insufficient intermediary resources.  \n\u2003\u2013 Tip: Ensure that all necessary ingredients and their prerequisites are available and that intermediary production (e.g. smelting for iron plates or copper cable crafting) is sufficient before initiating Lab crafting."}
