The agent repeatedly attempted to extract coal from the wooden chest without checking its inventory status.\n\n- **Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity**\n  - Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place. The agent should verify that the drop position for the burner mining drill is clear before attempting to insert items.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions Defined:**\n  - `extract_item(Prototype.Coal, wooden_chest.position, quantity=1)` - This function failed multiple times due to the wooden chest being empty or not containing coal.\n\n- **Important Variables Assigned:**\n  - `extracted_coal: int` - The quantity of coal being extracted.\n  - `wooden_chest: Chest` - The wooden chest entity.\n  - `burner_mining_drill: BurnerMiningDrill` - The burner mining drill entity.\n  - `furnace: Furnace` - The furnace entity."}
