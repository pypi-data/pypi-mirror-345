Repeated attempts to deploy a Lab at position (0.5, 2.5) for supplying Automation Science Packs have not materialized because the Lab item was unavailable in inventory and subsequent crafting efforts failed due to missing sub\u2010ingredients. While existing smelting furnaces (an iron furnace at (5.0, 5.0) and a copper furnace at (\u201327.0, \u201360.0)) were accessed for resource processing, none of these were constructed by the agent in these steps.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 API Invocation Issues \u2013 get_entities Errors\n  - Ensure the get_entities function is used with the proper signature. Avoid unsupported keyword arguments (such as \u201cradius\u201d) and mismatched positional parameters to prevent TypeError exceptions.\n\n\u2022 Handling Null Returns When Querying Entities\n  - Validate that the value returned from get_entities is not None before iterating over it. Use a fallback (for instance, an empty list) to avoid 'NoneType' iteration errors.\n\n\u2022 Lab Placement and Inventory Verification\n  - Before attempting to place a Lab at (0.5, 2.5), confirm that the Lab item is present in the inventory to prevent placement failures.\n\n\u2022 Lab Crafting Resource Requirements\n  - Double-check that all necessary sub-ingredients (e.g., iron-gear-wheel, electronic-circuit, copper-cable) are available and craftable before initiating Lab crafting. Ensure that prerequisite processes like smelting and intermediate crafting steps are functioning and that sufficient resources have been allocated.\n\n\u2022 Validating Lab Availability Prior to Supply Operations\n  - Confirm that a Lab structure exists on the map before attempting to supply it with Automation Science Packs, thereby avoiding errors related to missing Lab entities."}
