{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Wooden Chest at position (2.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest (position (2.5, 0.5)) containing iron-plate (100)\n\n### Original Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest (position (-14.5, -48.5)) containing iron-ore (10000)\n- Burner Mining Drill (position (-15.0, -50.0)) with no fuel\n- Stone Furnace (position (0.0, 0.0)) with coal (50) but no ingredients to smelt\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n- **Errors when extracting from a wooden chest**\n  - Ensure that the wooden chest contains the item you are trying to extract before attempting to extract. The error indicates that the wooden chest at (2.5, 0.5) did not contain iron-ore when extraction was attempted.\n  \n- **Errors when refueling the Burner Mining Drill**\n  - Ensure you have enough coal in your inventory to refuel the Burner Mining Drill. The logs indicate multiple instances of not having enough coal.\n\n- **Errors related to the Burner Mining Drill being out of fuel**\n  - Regularly check the fuel status of the Burner Mining Drill and ensure it is refueled to avoid interruptions in mining operations.\n\n- **Errors when the chest at drop position is full**\n  - If the chest at the drop position is full, empty it to allow the Burner Mining Drill to continue mining. The log indicates that the chest at (-14.5, -48.5) is full.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- **Utility Functions**\n  - `extract_item`: Used to extract items from entities. Failure occurred when trying to extract iron-ore from the wooden chest at (2.5, 0.5) due to the chest not containing the item.\n\n- **Important Variables**\n  - `extracted_ore`: int\n  - `current_inventory`: dict\n  - `new_chest_inventory`: dict\n  - `burner_mining_drill_position`: tuple (float, float)\n  - `original_chest_position`: tuple (float, float)"}
