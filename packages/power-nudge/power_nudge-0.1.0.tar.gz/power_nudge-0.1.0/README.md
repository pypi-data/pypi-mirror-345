# âš¡ PowerNudge

**PowerNudge** is a lightweight macOS utility that monitors your MacBook's battery percentage and sends you a **WhatsApp
alert via Twilio** when it reaches a predefined charging level â€” so you can unplug and prolong battery health.

Built with automation in mind, itâ€™s perfect for users who want a hands-free way to monitor charging without keeping an
eye on the battery all the time.
