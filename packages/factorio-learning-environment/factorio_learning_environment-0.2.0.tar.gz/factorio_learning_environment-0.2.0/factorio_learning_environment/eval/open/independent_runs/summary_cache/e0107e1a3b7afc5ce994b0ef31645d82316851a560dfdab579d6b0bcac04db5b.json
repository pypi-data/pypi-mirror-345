{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=5.5, y=21.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=5.5, y=21.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=-1.5, y=24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine\n- Small Electric Pole at position (x=3.5, y=20.5) for connecting to the power grid\n\n### Laboratory at Position (x=2.5, y=0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Lab at position (x=2.5, y=0.5) connected to the power supply\n- Automation Science Packs inserted into the lab\n\n### Furnace Setup at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with coal as fuel\n- Producing iron plates\n\n### Pipe Network\nConsists of:\n- PipeGroup for water transport from offshore pump to boiler\n- PipeGroup for steam transport from boiler to steam engine\n- Various pipes connecting these entities\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of:\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at positions [(x=1.5, y=10.5), (x=1.5, y=6.5), (x=1.5, y=2.5), (x=1.5, y=14.5), (x=3.5, y=20.5)]\n- Voltage level at 68033\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Research Setup\n- Ensure that the lab has the correct science packs and research is properly set. Check prerequisites for the research and ensure they are met before attempting to start research.\n\n### Errors with Fuel Management\n- Maintain a sufficient supply of coal in the inventory to refuel the boiler consistently. Harvest more coal if inventory is low.\n\n### Errors with Power Connections\n- Ensure that all power-consuming entities like the lab are properly connected to the power supply. Check connections if entities are not functioning as expected.\n\n### Errors with Entity Placement\n- Verify that entities are placed correctly and connected to necessary systems (e.g., pipes, power poles) to ensure they function as intended."}
