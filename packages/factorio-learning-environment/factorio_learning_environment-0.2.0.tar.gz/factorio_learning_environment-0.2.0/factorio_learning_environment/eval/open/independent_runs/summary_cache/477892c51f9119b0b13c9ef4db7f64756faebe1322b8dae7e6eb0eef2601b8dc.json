{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Setup (around x=41-45, y=-80 to -82)\nComplex automated mining and smelting setup consisting of:\n- Burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0) mining coal, working status\n- Wooden chest at (41.5, -80.5) storing coal and iron ore\n- Two burner inserters:\n  - First inserter at (42.5, -80.5) configured to move items from chest to belt\n  - Second inserter at (43.5, -80.5) configured to move items from belt to furnace\n- Transport belt system between (42.5, -81.5) and (43.5, -81.5)\n- Stone furnace at (45.0, -81.0) for smelting\n\nERROR TIPS\n1. Inserter Configuration Issues\n- Ensure inserter pickup and drop positions are properly aligned with source/destination\n- When using belts, make sure inserters are positioned correctly relative to belt height\n- Double check inserter rotation directions match the intended item flow\n\n2. Resource Flow Issues\n- Verify that items can properly flow through the entire production chain\n- Ensure inserters have correct pickup/drop positions relative to chests and belts\n- Check that furnaces have both fuel and ingredients accessible\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nImportant Variables:\nNone explicitly defined in provided logs\n\nFunctions:\nNone explicitly defined in provided logs\n\nThe system appears to be focused on physical entity placement and configuration rather than programmatic function definitions."}
