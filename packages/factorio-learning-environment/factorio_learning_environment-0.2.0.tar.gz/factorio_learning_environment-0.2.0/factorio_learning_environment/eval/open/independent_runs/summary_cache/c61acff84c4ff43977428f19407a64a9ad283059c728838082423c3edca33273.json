{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Electricity generator at position(-5.5, 3.5)\nConsists of offshore pump(position -9.5, -0.5), boiler(position -5.5, 0.0) and steam engine(position -5.5, 3.5)\n\n#### Crude oil processing factory at position(17.5, 40.5)\nConsists of pumpjack(position 17.5, 40.5), oil refinery(position 22.5, 40.5) and associated pipes\n\n#### Lubricant factory at position(27.5, 40.5)\nConsists of chemical plant(position 27.5, 40.5)\n\n#### Power network\nConsists of small electric poles connecting steam engine, pumpjack, oil refinery, and chemical plant\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n* Errors when placing entities at occupied positions:\n  - Ensure the target position is clear of other entities before attempting to place a new entity.\n  - Example: Error in Step 4, Step 11, Step 15, Step 16, and multiple subsequent steps when trying to place entities at occupied positions.\n\n* Errors when using undefined recipe names:\n  - Verify that the recipe name used is valid and correctly spelled.\n  - Example: Error in Step 6 when trying to set the chemical plant recipe to \"Lubricant\" due to an AttributeError.\n\n* Errors when connecting entities with incompatible fluid requirements:\n  - Ensure that the fluid output of the source entity matches the fluid input required by the target entity's recipe.\n  - Example: Errors in Step 7, Step 10, Step 14, Step 17, Step 19, Step 21, Step 23, Step 26, Step 28, Step 29, Step 31, Step 32, Step 33, Step 35, Step 37, and Step 41, Step 73, and Step 76 when trying to connect entities due to a mismatch in fluid requirements or blocked connection points.\n\n* Errors due to unconnected power networks:\n  - Ensure that all entities requiring electricity are connected to a power source.\n  - Example: Warnings in multiple steps when various entities were not receiving electricity.\n\n* Errors due to undefined variables:\n  - Ensure that all variables used in the code are defined before they are used.\n  - Example: Error in Step 9, Step 34, and Step 44 due to using undefined variables.\n\n* Errors when getting an entity at a specific position:\n  - Ensure that an entity of the specified type exists at the given position.\n  - Example: Error in Step 12 when trying to get a chemical plant at (27.5, 40.5) that does not exist.\n\n* Syntax errors:\n  - Ensure that the code is syntactically correct.\n  - Example: Error in Step 38 due to a 'return' statement outside a function, and in Step 70 due to a TypeError.\n\n* Errors when placing underground pipes:\n  - Ensure that the target position for the underground pipe is clear and that there is a suitable entity to connect to at the target location.\n  - Example: Error in Step 51, Step 59, Step 69, Step 72 when trying to place underground pipes at multiple positions.\n\n* Errors due to bad operand types:\n  - Ensure that the operands used in an operation are of the correct type.\n  - Example: Error in Step 70 due to a TypeError.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n* `place_entity(entity_type, position)`: Places an entity of the given type at the specified position. \n  - Failure modes: \n    - Attempting to place an entity at a position that is already occupied.\n    - Using an invalid or undefined entity type.\n  - Success mode: Entity is successfully placed at the specified position.\n\n* `set_entity_recipe(entity, recipe_name)`: Sets the recipe for the given entity.\n  - Failure modes: \n    - Using an invalid or undefined recipe name.\n  - Success mode: Recipe is successfully set for the entity.\n\n* `connect_entities(source_entity, target_entity, connection_type)`: Connects two entities using the specified connection type.\n  - Failure modes: \n    - Entities are not compatible for the specified connection type.\n    - Fluids at source entity do not match the required input at target entity.\n  - Success mode: Entities are successfully connected.\n\n* Important variables:\n  - `entity_type`: Type of entity to be placed (e.g., 'pipe', 'pipe-to-ground', 'oil-refinery', etc.)\n  - `position`: Position where the entity is to be placed (e.g., `(x, y)`)\n  - `recipe_name`: Name of the recipe to be set for an entity (e.g., 'BasicOilProcessing', 'SolidFuelFromHeavyOil')"}
