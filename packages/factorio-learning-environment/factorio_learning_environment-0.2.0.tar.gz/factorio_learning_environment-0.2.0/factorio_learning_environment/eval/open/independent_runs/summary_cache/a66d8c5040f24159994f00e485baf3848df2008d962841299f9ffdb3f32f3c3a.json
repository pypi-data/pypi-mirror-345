For example, attempting to insert coal into a boiler without having coal in the inventory.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Check that the source entity has items available for the inserter to pick up. Ensure that the production chain is not interrupted and that resources are adequately supplied.\n\n### Errors with Assembling Machines Missing Ingredients\n- Ensure that the assembling machine has all the required ingredients available. In this case, make sure copper plates are supplied to the assembling machine to produce copper cables.\n\n### Errors with Furnaces Having No Ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary raw materials to process. Check the supply chain to ensure continuous production.\n\nBy addressing these errors, you can improve the efficiency and productivity of your factory setup."}
