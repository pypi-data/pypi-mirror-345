{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Smelting Facility at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\n  - Fuel: 2 units of coal\n  - Status: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Current inventory: 18 iron plates\n\n### Iron Plate Smelting Facility at Position (2.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (2.0, 0.0)\n  - Fuel: 8 units of coal\n  - Status: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Current inventory: 18 iron plates\n\n### Coal Mining and Collection Setup at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0)\n  - Fuel: 0 units of coal\n  - Status: No fuel\n  - Warnings: Chest at drop position is full. Empty the chest at (40.5, -83.5) to continue mining.\n- Burner Inserter at position (41.5, -80.5)\n  - Fuel: 31 units of coal\n  - Status: Waiting for source items\n- Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -79.5)\n  - Status: Normal\n  - Inventory: 11 units of coal\n- Wooden Chest at position (40.5, -83.5)\n  - Status: Normal\n  - Inventory: 12 units of coal\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when attempting to place entities without having them in inventory\n- Ensure you have the required entity in your inventory before attempting to place it on the map.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient crafting materials\n- Verify that you have all necessary ingredients in your inventory before attempting to craft an item. For example, wood is a raw resource that must be gathered before crafting a wooden chest.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing. Consider increasing spacing, changing direction, or changing the reference position.\n\n### Errors when attempting to insert items without having them in inventory\n- Verify that you have the items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity.\n\n### Errors due to undefined variables\n- Ensure all variables are defined before using them. Double-check variable names for typos or incorrect references.\n\n### Errors due to misaligned entity positions\n- Ensure entities are aligned correctly for intended operations. Verify positions and adjust entities to ensure proper interaction, such as aligning inserters with chests or drills.\n\n### Errors when attempting to interact with non-existent entities\n- Double-check the existence of entities at specified positions before attempting interactions. Ensure the correct entity type is present at the intended location.\n\n### Errors when attempting to place a wooden chest at an occupied position\n- Before placing a wooden chest, ensure the target location is clear of any existing objects. Consider adjusting the position or removing the obstructing entity.\n\n### Errors when connecting entities with belts\n- Ensure that belts are connected between compatible entities. For example, belts cannot be directly connected to a wooden chest; use an inserter to transfer items from belts to chests. Verify the path length and ensure it's valid for the connection.\n\n### Errors due to lack of fuel in mining drills\n- Regularly check and refuel mining drills to ensure continuous operation. Keep a sufficient stock of fuel in your inventory for refueling.\n\n### Errors when attempting to place a stone furnace without having it in inventory\n- Ensure you have a stone furnace in your inventory before attempting to place it on the map. Gather necessary resources to craft one if needed.\n\n### Errors when attempting to craft items that require a crafting machine\n- Ensure you have access to a crafting machine or furnace when crafting items that require them. For example, iron plates require smelting in a furnace.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient resources for crafting\n- Ensure you have enough resources in your inventory before attempting to craft items. For example, crafting transport belts requires iron plates and iron gear wheels."}
