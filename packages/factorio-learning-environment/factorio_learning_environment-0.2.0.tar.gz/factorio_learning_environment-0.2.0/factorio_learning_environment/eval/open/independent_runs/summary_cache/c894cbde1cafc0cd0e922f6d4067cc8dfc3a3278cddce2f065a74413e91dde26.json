{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=1.5, y=23.0)\nConsists of:\n- Boiler at position (x=1.5, y=23.0)\n- Steam engine (position not specified)\n- Offshore pump (position not specified)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting pipes\n- Ensure that both endpoints of the pipe connection are valid and reachable. The error indicates a failure to connect pipes between positions (x=1.5, y=21.5) and (x=17.5, y=17.5). Verify that the positions are correct and that there are no obstructions.\n\n### Attribute Errors with Electricity Group\n- When accessing attributes of an electricity group, ensure that the object is correctly instantiated and has the expected attributes. The error suggests that 'ElectricityGroup' does not have an attribute 'energy'. Verify the object's type and its available attributes.\n- Similarly, ensure that when accessing attributes of a list, you are not mistakenly treating it as an object with attributes. The error suggests that a 'list' object was incorrectly accessed for an attribute 'voltage'.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `connect_entities`: This function attempts to connect entities, such as pipes, between specified positions. Ensure that the positions are valid and that the entities can be connected without obstruction.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `pipes`: A variable used to store the result of connecting entities. Ensure that it is correctly assigned and used within the context of valid connections."}
