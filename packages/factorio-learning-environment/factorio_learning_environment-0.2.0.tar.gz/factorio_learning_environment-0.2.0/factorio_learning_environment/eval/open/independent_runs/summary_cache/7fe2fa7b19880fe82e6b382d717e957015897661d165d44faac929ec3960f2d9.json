{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility at Position(-20.0, -70.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position(-23.0, -68.0) extracting copper ore and depositing into a Wooden Chest at Position(-23.5, -69.5).\n- Stone Furnace at Position(-20.0, -70.0) and Position(-18.0, -70.0) for smelting copper ore into copper plates.\n- BeltGroup connecting the mining drill to the furnaces.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position(-19.0, -65.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position(-14.0, -53.0) extracting iron ore and depositing into a Wooden Chest at Position(-14.5, -54.5).\n- Stone Furnace at Position(-19.0, -65.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at Position(-17.5, -64.5) transferring iron plates into a Wooden Chest at Position(-16.5, -64.5).\n- BeltGroup connecting the mining drill to the furnace.\n\n### Coal and Iron Ore Storage at Position(1.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at Position(1.5, 0.5) storing coal, iron ore, and iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at Position(2.5, 0.5) transferring items between chests.\n\n### Belt Network\nConsists of multiple BeltGroups facilitating the movement of materials between different production facilities:\n- BeltGroup at Position(-21.5, -67.5) connecting various inputs and outputs for efficient material transport.\n- Additional BeltGroups at various positions ensuring connectivity and material flow across the map.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Error in Accessing BeltGroup Attributes\n- Ensure that you are accessing the correct attributes of the BeltGroup object. The 'direction' attribute is not directly available on BeltGroup; instead, access it through individual Belt objects within the group.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
