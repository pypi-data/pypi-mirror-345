{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-7.0, 23.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (-3.5, 23.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-7.0, 23.5)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe Group connecting these entities\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Furnace 1 at Position (-14.0, -49.0)\n- Furnace 2 at Position (-12.0, -48.0)\n- Burner Inserters at Positions (-13.5, -47.5), (-14.5, -45.5), (-13.5, -45.5), (-11.5, -45.5), (-9.5, -44.5), (-14.5, -43.5)\n- Iron Chest at Position (-11.5, -44.5)\n- Wooden Chests at Positions (-13.5, -46.5), (-13.5, -44.5)\n- Belt Group connecting furnaces and chests\n\n### Transport Belt Network\nConsists of:\n- Belts connecting various positions for material transport, including:\n  - Belt from (x=-11.5, y=-46.5) to (x=-9.5, y=-46.5), direction RIGHT\n  - Belt from (x=-8.5, y=-45.5) to (x=-8.5, y=-43.5), direction DOWN\n  - Additional belts connecting other parts of the facility\n\n### Lab\n- Located at an unspecified position, currently with no research in progress\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Blockage Errors\n- Ensure that inserters have a clear path to deposit items into their destination. Check for blockages in the destination chests or belts.\n\n### Inventory Management Errors\n- Before attempting to insert items into entities like furnaces or boilers, verify that the required items are present in your inventory to prevent insertion errors.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Make sure that the source entities for inserters have items available for pickup to avoid delays in production.\n\n### Destination Chest Full\n- Regularly check and clear out destination chests to prevent them from becoming full and blocking further item insertion.\n\n### Errors When Using Extracting but Being Too Far\n- Move closer to the target entity from which you want to extract items before attempting to extract.\n\n### Errors When Placing into a Tile Which is Occupied by Another Entity\n- Ensure the target tile is free of other entities before attempting to place a new entity."}
