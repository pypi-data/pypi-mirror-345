{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Mining and Smelting Setup at (-21, -74)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-21, -73) mining copper ore\n- Iron chest at (-21.5, -74.5) storing copper ore\n- Burner inserter at (-20.5, -74.5) moving ore to furnace\n- Stone furnace at (-19, -74) smelting copper plates\n\n### Iron Mining and Processing Line (-2, -76)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-2, -76) mining iron ore\n- Complex belt system connecting components\n- Iron chest at (-1.5, -74.5) storing iron ore\n- Multiple burner inserters at (-0.5, -74.5) and (0.5, -74.5) moving materials\n- Iron chest at (1.5, -74.5) storing iron plates\n\n### Furnace Processing Line (3, -73)\nConsists of:\n- Two stone furnaces at (3, -73) and (5, -73)\n- Multiple burner inserters:\n  - At (3.5, -74.5) moving materials to chest\n  - At (5.5, -74.5) handling furnace input/output\n  - At (6.5, -72.5) moving processed materials\n- Storage chests:\n  - Iron chest at (3.5, -75.5) storing iron plates\n  - Iron chest at (7.5, -72.5) storing iron plates\n  - Iron chest at (3.5, -71.5) for additional storage\n- Complex belt system connecting various components\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Conflicts\n- Cannot place burner inserter where one already exists\n- Before placing entities, verify the target position is not already occupied\n- Consider using different spacing or direction when placing entities near existing ones\n\n### Entity Pickup Errors\n- Ensure the entity exists at the specified position before attempting pickup\n- Verify coordinates are exact when trying to pick up entities\n- Double check entity type matches what you're trying to pick up (transport-belt in this case)\n\n### System Design Considerations\n- When creating complex production lines, plan entity placement carefully to avoid conflicts\n- Consider spacing between entities to allow for inserters and belts\n- Maintain clear input/output paths for materials flow"}
