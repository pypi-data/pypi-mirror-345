{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-14.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-12.0, -51.0) extracting iron ore and dropping it into a chest at position (-11.5, -49.5).\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-14.0, -49.0) fueled by coal and processing iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-11.5, -49.5) storing iron ore extracted by the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserters**:\n  - Inserter at position (-11.5, -48.5) moving items from the chest at (-11.5, -49.5) to the furnace.\n  - Inserter at position (-13.5, -46.5) waiting for source items from the chest at (-13.5, -45.5).\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (52.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (52.0, -82.0) extracting coal and dropping it into a chest at position (53.5, -80.5).\n- **Wooden Chests**:\n  - Chest at position (53.5, -80.5) storing coal extracted by the mining drill.\n  - Chest at position (52.5, -78.5) storing coal moved by inserters.\n  - Chest at position (52.5, -77.5) storing coal moved by inserters.\n- **Burner Inserters**:\n  - Inserter at position (52.5, -79.5) moving coal from the chest at (53.5, -80.5) to another chest.\n  - Inserter at position (52.5, -76.5) moving coal from the chest at (52.5, -77.5) to another chest.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors due to Insufficient Inventory Items\n- Ensure that you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities. For example, attempting to insert coal into a drill without having coal in the inventory resulted in an error.\n\n### Errors from Entities Running Out of Fuel\n- Regularly check and refuel entities like burner mining drills and inserters to prevent them from stopping due to lack of fuel.\n\n### Errors from Full Storage\n- Monitor storage entities such as chests to ensure they do not become full, which can halt production processes. For instance, the chest at (-11.5, -49.5) was full, preventing further mining.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - `insert_item`: Attempts to insert a specified quantity of an item into a target entity. Ensure the item is available in the inventory before invoking this function.\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `iron_ore_drill`: Represents the burner mining drill entity for iron ore extraction.\n  - `current_inventory`: Dictionary tracking the current inventory items and their quantities, e.g., `{'wooden-chest': 3, 'wood': 10, 'iron-ore': 625, 'iron-plate': 865}`."}
