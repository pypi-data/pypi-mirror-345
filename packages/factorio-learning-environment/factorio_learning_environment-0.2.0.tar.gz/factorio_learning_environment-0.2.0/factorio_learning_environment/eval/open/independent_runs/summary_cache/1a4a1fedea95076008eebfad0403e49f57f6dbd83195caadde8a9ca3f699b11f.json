{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System at (-7.0,22.5)\n- **Boiler** at (-7.0,22.5) - Currently out of fuel (status: NO_FUEL)\n- **Steam engine** at (-3.5,22.5) - Not connected to power network (status: NOT_CONNECTED)\n- **Offshore pump** at (-11.5,21.5) - Operational (status: WORKING)\n- **Fuel system**:\n  - Coal chest at (-6.5,19.5) - Contains 79 coal\n  - Burner inserter at (-6.5,20.5) - Waiting for source items (status: WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS)\n\n### Oil Extraction System at (17.5,40.5)\n- **Pumpjack** at (17.5,40.5) - Not receiving power (status: NO_POWER)\n- **Storage tank** at (21.5,40.5) - Operational but empty (status: WORKING)\n\n### Oil Refinery Complex at (25.5,40.5)\n- **Oil refinery** at (25.5,40.5) - Not receiving power (status: NO_POWER)\n- **Pipe connections**:\n  - Input connection at (26.5,43.5) - Empty pipe system\n  - Output connection at (27.5,37.5) - Not configured\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Persistent System Issues\n1. **Power network failures** (occurred 7 times)\n   - Steam engine not connected despite multiple attempts\n   - Solution:\n     - Verify exact connection points between boiler output (-5.5,22.5) and engine inputs (-3.5,20.0/-3.5,25.0)\n     - Use direct power pole connections without gaps\n     - Implement connection validation before activation\n\n2. **Fuel management problems** (occurred 6 times)\n   - Boiler repeatedly runs out of fuel\n   - Solution:\n     - Implement automated fuel transfer with burner inserter\n     - Maintain minimum 50 coal buffer in chest\n     - Set up fuel level monitoring system\n\n3. **Fluid transfer failures** (occurred 4 times)\n   - Refinery not receiving crude oil despite connections\n   - Solution:\n     - Verify pipe connections between storage (21.5,40.5) and refinery (26.5,43.5)\n     - Ensure pumpjack is powered and producing\n     - Monitor fluid levels in storage tank\n\n### New Critical Issues\n1. **Inventory management errors** (occurred 3 times)\n   - Attempting to place pumps without having them in inventory\n   - Solution:\n     - Verify inventory before placement attempts\n     - Maintain minimum stock of critical components\n     - Implement inventory tracking system\n\n2. **Entity status misinterpretation** (occurred 2 times)\n   - Incorrect attribute access attempts (energy/contents)\n   - Solution:\n     - Use correct API calls for status checks\n     - Verify entity properties before access\n     - Implement error handling for status checks\n\n3. **Connection validation gaps** (occurred 2 times)\n   - Attempting to connect empty fluid systems\n   - Solution:\n     - Verify fluid presence before connections\n     - Implement pre-connection validation\n     - Monitor system status before operations\n\n### Previous Recommendations Still Valid\n1. Maintain complete system documentation\n2. Implement staged activation procedures\n3. Create isolation procedures for failures\n4. Document all automated systems"}
