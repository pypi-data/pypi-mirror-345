{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and transfers it to the adjacent chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace. Currently misaligned, causing issues with ore transfer.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates, but currently not receiving ore due to misalignment of the inserter.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Misalignment of Inserter\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly aligned to pick up items from the chest and drop them into the furnace. Verify the pickup and drop positions to ensure they match the intended transfer path.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Ingredients\n- Check the setup of the inserter and ensure it is operational and correctly positioned to transfer materials to the furnace. The furnace requires ingredients to smelt, so ensure the inserter is not out of fuel and is properly aligned.\n\n### Inserter Out of Fuel\n- Regularly refuel inserters to maintain continuous operation. Keep an adequate supply of coal or other fuel types to avoid interruptions in the transfer process."}
