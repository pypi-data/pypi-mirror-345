{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-4.5, 23.0)\nConsists of boiler (position -4.5, 23.0), offshore pump (position -7.5, 25.5), and steam engine (position -0.5, -9.5). The boiler is currently out of fuel and not connected to a power network.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position x1) and a furnace at position(0.0, 0.0)\n- Burner mining drill (position x2) and a furnace at position(5.0, 5.0)\n\n### Lab at position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of a lab (position 0.0, 0.0) that is currently not powered.\n\n### Pipe groups\n- PipeGroup (fluid system=20098, position x=-8.5, y=-7.5)\n- PipeGroup (fluid system=20111, position x=-14.5, y=23.5)\n- PipeGroup (fluid system=20112, position x=-7.5, y=23.5) - currently full of water\n- PipeGroup (fluid system=20115, position x=-18.5, y=25.5)\n- PipeGroup (fluid system=20119, position x=-20.5, y=29.5)\n- PipeGroup (fluid system=20118, position x=-21.5, y=28.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when removing pipes\n- Ensure the pipe you are trying to remove exists at the specified position before attempting to pick it up. \n\n### Errors when placing pipes\n- Avoid placing pipes in locations where the entity footprint overlaps with water. Check the area before placing.\n\n### Errors related to inserting items\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into machines. In this case, ensure you have coal before trying to insert it into the boiler. \n\n### General placement errors\n- Always check that the tile is free and that the entity can be placed there before attempting to place any structure or item."}
