{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) extracting iron ore, with a drop position at (-14.5, -48.5).\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-14.5, -48.5) and (-15.5, -48.5) for storing extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5) transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0) processing iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-14.5, -47.5) transferring items between chests and furnaces.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage and Distribution\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-6.5, -49.5), (-6.5, -48.5), (-7.5, -48.5), (-5.5, -48.5), (-4.5, -48.5), and (-3.5, -48.5) storing iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserters** at positions (-11.5, -46.5), (-8.5, -47.5), and (-11.5, -45.5) for moving iron plates between chests and furnaces.\n\n### Secondary Iron Processing Facility at Position (-10.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-10.0, -48.0) with no ingredients to smelt, indicating a need for iron ore supply.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-11.5, -46.5) waiting for source items to transfer.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Blockage and Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the drop position for inserters is not blocked. Regularly check and clear any blockages to maintain continuous operation.\n- Verify that source items are available for inserters to pick up. Ensure that the supply chain is not interrupted.\n\n### Errors in Extracting Items\n- Before attempting to extract items, confirm that the target inventory contains the required items and has sufficient space.\n- When extracting items from a furnace or chest, ensure the quantity specified is available to avoid extraction errors.\n\n### Fuel Management\n- Regularly refuel mining drills and furnaces to prevent interruptions in operation. Monitor fuel levels and replenish as necessary.\n\n### Inventory Management\n- Maintain an organized inventory to prevent overflow and ensure efficient item transfer between entities."}
