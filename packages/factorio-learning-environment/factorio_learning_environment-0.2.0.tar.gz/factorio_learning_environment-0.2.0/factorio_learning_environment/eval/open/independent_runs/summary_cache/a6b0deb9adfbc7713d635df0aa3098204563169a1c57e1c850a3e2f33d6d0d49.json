{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Complex at (-10.0, -59.0)\nConsists of three burner mining drills in a row, connected to wooden chests and transport belts:\n- First mining drill at (-10.0, -59.0) dropping to chest at (-9.5, -57.5)\n- Second mining drill at (-8.0, -59.0) dropping to chest at (-7.5, -57.5)\n- Third mining drill at (-6.0, -59.0) dropping to chest at (-5.5, -57.5)\n- Series of inserters moving items between chests\n- Transport belt system connecting the mining area\n\n### Smelting Line at (-27.0, -59.0)\nMultiple furnaces with inserters and chests for processing ore:\n- Furnace at (-27.0, -59.0) with burner mining drill at (-28.0, -61.0)\n- Furnace at (-23.0, -58.0)\n- Furnace at (-21.0, -58.0)\n- Output chest at (-24.5, -58.5) containing iron and copper plates\n- Storage chest at (-22.5, -55.5) for processed plates\n\n### Main Smelting Array at (0.0, 0.0)\nFour parallel smelting columns:\n- First column: Furnace at (0.0, 0.0) with input chest at (0.5, -2.5) and output chest at (0.5, 2.5)\n- Second column: Furnace at (2.0, 0.0) with input chest at (2.5, -2.5) and output chest at (2.5, 2.5)\n- Third column: Furnace at (4.0, 0.0) with input chest at (4.5, -2.5) and output chest at (4.5, 2.5)\n- Fourth column: Furnace at (6.0, 0.0) with input chest at (6.5, -2.5) and output chest at (6.5, 2.5)\nEach column has inserters for input and output handling\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting entities directly\n- Cannot connect belts directly from wooden chests - use inserters as intermediaries\n- Use inserters to move items between chests and belts\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied spaces\n- Check if the target position is already occupied before placing new entities\n- When placing inserters next to existing entities, ensure proper spacing and direction\n- Consider using different spacing values or directions if initial placement fails\n\n### Resource management\n- Monitor chest capacity - full chests will block mining operations\n- Empty full chests regularly to maintain production flow\n- Ensure proper fuel distribution to all burner entities"}
