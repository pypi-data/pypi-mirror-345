{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=17.5, y=20.5) with status NOT_CONNECTED and warnings ['no input liquid', 'no fluid present in connections']\n- Boiler at position (x=1.5, y=23.0) with status NO_FUEL and warnings ['out of fuel']\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5) with status WORKING\n\n### Pipe Network\nConsists of the following pipe groups:\n- PipeGroup at position (x=9.5, y=15.5) with status EMPTY\n- PipeGroup at position (x=6.5, y=21.5) with status EMPTY\n- PipeGroup at position (x=-9.5, y=23.5) with status FULL_OUTPUT, fluid: water\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of the following:\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at positions [(x=16.5, y=24.5), (x=33.5, y=24.5), (x=35.5, y=24.5), ..., (x=7.5, y=8.5), (x=14.5, y=20.5), (x=21.5, y=27.5)] with voltage 0\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure that the pipes are correctly aligned and connected to the intended entities. Verify that the starting and ending positions are valid and that the entities are compatible for connection.\n\n### Errors when Placing Small Electric Poles\n- Make sure to identify a suitable position for placing electric poles. Avoid attempting to place poles in occupied or invalid tiles.\n\n### NameError for Undefined Variables\n- Ensure that all variables are defined before use. Double-check for typos or incorrect variable names. Consider using autocomplete features or variable suggestions to avoid such errors.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `connect_entities(Position, Position, {Prototype})`: Attempts to connect entities using pipes. Ensure positions are valid and entities are compatible.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `pipes`: List of connected pipe entities.\n- `pole_position`: Intended position for placing electric poles. Ensure this variable is defined before use."}
