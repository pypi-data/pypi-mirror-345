{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-0.5, 25.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (-0.5, 25.5)\n- Boiler at position (-5.5, 25.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n\n### Pipe Network\n- Pipe Group at position (-1.5, 17.5) with fluid system 24831, currently empty\n- Pipe Group at position (-8.5, 20.5) with fluid system 24835, containing water and working\n- Pipe Group at position (-7.5, 25.5) with fluid system 24844, currently empty\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Furnace at position (15.0, 0.0) with a status of no ingredients to smelt\n- Inserters at positions (17.5, 0.5) and (16.5, 0.5), both not receiving electricity\n- Wooden Chests at positions (5.5, 0.5) and (18.5, 0.5)\n\n### Electrical Network\n- Electricity Group with poles at various positions including (16.5, 8.5), (7.5, 10.5), (11.5, 6.5), (5.5, 21.5), (1.5, 25.5), and (15.5, 2.5), currently not supplying power to inserters\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Pipe Placement\n- Ensure that the target location for placing pipes or underground pipes is not already occupied by another entity. Remove any obstructing entities before attempting to place a new pipe.\n\n### Errors with Boiler and Steam Engine Connectivity\n- Verify that all necessary connections are in place for the boiler and steam engine to function. Ensure that pipes are correctly connected to allow fluid flow.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Power Supply\n- Check that inserters are connected to a power source. Ensure that the electrical network is complete and operational to provide power to all connected entities.\n\n### Errors with Underground Pipe Placement\n- Adjust the positioning of underground pipes to ensure they can be placed correctly. Verify that the start and end points are clear and properly aligned."}
