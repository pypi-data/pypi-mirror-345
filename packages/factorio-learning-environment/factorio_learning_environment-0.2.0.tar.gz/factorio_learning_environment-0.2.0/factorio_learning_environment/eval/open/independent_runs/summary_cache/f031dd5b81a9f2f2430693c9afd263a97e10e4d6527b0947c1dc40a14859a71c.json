{"content": "# FACTORIO AGENT REPORT\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Transport System at (-82.0, -80.5)\nComplex system consisting of:\n- Burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0) mining coal\n- Wooden chest at (41.5, -80.5) collecting coal\n- Two burner inserters:\n  1. First inserter at (42.5, -80.5) moving coal from chest to transport belt\n  2. Second inserter at (43.5, -79.5) picking from belt system\n- Transport belt system connecting the components with 13 belts\n  - Input belt at (43.5, -80.5)\n  - Output belt at (42.5, -79.5)\n\nCurrent operational status:\n- Mining drill is working with 34 coal as fuel\n- Chest contains 402 coal\n- First inserter waiting for space in destination\n- Second inserter waiting for space in destination\n- Belt system is working and contains 43 coal\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Errors\n- Ensure target location is clear of other entities and valid terrain before placing structures\n- Water tiles cannot have structures placed on them\n- Check entity dimensions and required free space before placement\n\n### Transport System Design Errors\n- Cannot connect belts directly to chests - must use inserters as intermediaries\n- Ensure proper alignment of inserters with their pickup and drop positions\n- Clear blocked belts to prevent system bottlenecks\n\n### Structure Alignment Issues\n- Pay attention to coordinate alignment when placing connected structures\n- Verify inserter reach distances match intended pickup and drop positions\n- Consider using half-tile offsets (x.5, y.5) for proper inserter alignment\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Variables\n- `furnace`: StoneFurnace - Multiple failed placement attempts\n- `inserter`: BurnerInserter - Used for item transport\n- `belts`: BeltGroup - Transport belt system\n\n### Functions\n- `place_entity()`: Places game entities at specified coordinates\n  - Failures: Entity collision, invalid terrain\n- `connect_entities()`: Creates connections between entities\n  - Failures: Invalid connection attempts (chest to belt)"}
