{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) with a drop position at (41.5, -80.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (41.0, -80.0)\n\n### Iron Plate Mine at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) with a drop position at (-14.5, -48.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5)\n\n### Copper Furnace at Position (-20.0, -71.0)\nConsists of the following entity:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -71.0)\n\n### Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entity:\n- Wooden Chest at position (43.5, -79.5)\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors when attempting to insert items without sufficient inventory\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities. For example, coal was attempted to be inserted into drills and furnaces without having enough in inventory.\n\n### Errors due to entities being out of fuel\n- Regularly check and refuel entities such as Burner Mining Drills and Furnaces to prevent them from running out of fuel and halting production.\n\n### Errors due to furnaces having no ingredients to smelt\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary raw materials to process. Keep track of the input inventory of furnaces to maintain continuous operation.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - `insert_item`: Used to insert items into entities. Ensure that the source inventory has sufficient items before calling this function.\n\n- **Variables:**\n  - `iron_drill`: Represents the iron mining drill entity.\n  - `iron_furnace`: Represents the iron furnace entity."}
