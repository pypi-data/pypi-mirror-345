{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-3.5, 27.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-3.5, 27.5)\n- Boiler at position (-5.5, 25.0)\n- Steam Engine at position (-0.5, 25.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting the boiler and steam engine\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (15.0, 0.0)\n- Inserter 1 at position (17.5, 0.5) and Inserter 2 at position (16.5, 0.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (5.5, 0.5) and another at position (18.5, 0.5)\n- Electricity Group with poles at various positions including (17.5, -0.5)\n\n### Pipe Network\n- PipeGroup at position (-1.5, 17.5) and various other positions\n- PipeGroup at position (0.5, 16.5) and various other positions\n- PipeGroup at position (-6.5, 20.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Power Connectivity\n- Ensure that all entities requiring power are connected to the power network. Check connections between power poles and ensure they are linked to the steam engine.\n\n### Errors with Fluid Connectivity\n- Verify that all fluid-related entities such as boilers and steam engines are properly connected with pipes and have the necessary input liquid. Ensure that the offshore pump is correctly placed and connected to the boiler.\n\n### Errors with Inserters\n- Make sure inserters are receiving power and are correctly positioned to pick up and drop items. Check the direction and power connectivity of inserters.\n\n### Repeated Replacement of Offshore Pump\n- Avoid unnecessary replacement of offshore pumps unless there is a change in the setup or a malfunction. Ensure the pump is correctly positioned and connected to the fluid network."}
