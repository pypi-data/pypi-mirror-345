{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, -60.0) with a drop position at (4.5, -58.5). This drill extracts iron ore and places it into a wooden chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (4.5, -58.5) storing extracted iron ore.\n- **Stone Furnaces** for smelting iron ore into iron plates:\n  - Furnace at position (-15.0, -48.0), currently working with iron ore and producing iron plates.\n  - Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0), currently working with iron ore and producing iron plates.\n  - Furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0), currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Storage Area\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Multiple **Wooden Chests** at positions (5.5, -60.5), (7.5, -60.5), (6.5, -60.5), (9.5, -60.5), and (8.5, -60.5), currently empty.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Full Output Warnings in Furnaces\n- Ensure to regularly extract the smelted iron plates from furnaces to prevent the output from becoming full and halting production.\n\n### Chest Full Warnings\n- Regularly empty the chest at position (4.5, -58.5) to ensure continuous operation of the burner mining drill. A full chest will stop the drill from working.\n\n### No Ingredients in Furnaces\n- Ensure that furnaces have a continuous supply of iron ore to prevent them from idling due to lack of ingredients.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the current inventory of items such as 'wooden-chest', 'iron-plate', and 'iron-gear-wheel'.\n- `burner_mining_drill_status`: EntityStatus - Indicates the working status and warnings of the burner mining drill.\n- `furnace_status`: Dict[Position, EntityStatus] - Tracks the status and warnings of each furnace based on its position."}
