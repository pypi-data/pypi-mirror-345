Do not specify a position when passing an Entity object directly.\n- If you need to specify a position for removal, ensure that the first argument is not an Entity object.\n\n### Undefined Entity Name\n- Ensure that the variable `entity` is defined before using it in the `pickup_entity` function. Consider using `get_entity` or `place_entity` if needed.\n\n### Clearing Obstructions\n- When clearing obstructions, ensure that the area is clear of any entities that might interfere with the placement or operation of other structures."}
