{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace at position (-15.0, -49.0) with a status of FULL_OUTPUT, currently holding 46 iron ore and 100 iron plates.\n- Inserter at position (54.5, -83.5) transferring items from a chest at position (56.5, -83.5).\n\n### Mining and Storage Facility at Position (40.0, -84.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (40.0, -84.0) with a wooden chest at position (40.5, -82.5) to accept output.\n- Wooden chest at position (40.5, -82.5) containing coal.\n- Wooden chest at position (41.5, -83.5) currently empty.\n- Inserter at position (41.5, -80.5) waiting for source items.\n\n### Transport System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- BeltGroup with inputs and outputs connecting various positions, facilitating the movement of coal and other resources.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Mining Drill Output is Blocked\n- Ensure that the output from the mining drill is not blocked by items on the ground. Regularly clear any items that may obstruct the output.\n\n### Errors when Furnace Output is Full\n- Regularly extract items from the furnace to prevent it from reaching FULL_OUTPUT status, which halts production. Ensure there is a mechanism to transfer items out of the furnace efficiently.\n\n### Errors when Inserter is Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source chest or entity contains items for the inserter to transfer. Regularly check and refill the source as needed to maintain continuous operation."}
