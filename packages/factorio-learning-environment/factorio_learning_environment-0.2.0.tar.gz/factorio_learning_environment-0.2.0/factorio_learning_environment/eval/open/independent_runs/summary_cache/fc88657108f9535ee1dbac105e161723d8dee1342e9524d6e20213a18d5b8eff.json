{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Ore Mine at position (16.0, 71.0)\nConsists of \n- Burner Mining Drill (position x=16.0, y=71.0)\n- Chest (position x=15.5, y=69.5) to collect iron ore\n- Burner Inserter (position x=14.5, y=69.5) to output iron ore from chest (currently facing down, pickup position x=14.5 y=68.5, drop position x=14.5 y=70.5)\n- Burner Inserter (position x=16.5, y=69.5) to input iron ore into furnace (currently facing up, pickup position x=16.5 y=70.5, drop position x=16.5 y=68.5)\n- BeltGroup (positions x=14.5 y=70.5, x=15.5 y=68.5, x=16.5 y=68.5, x=17.5 y=68.5, x=17.5 y=69.5, x=17.5 y=70.5, x=17.5 y=71.5, x=17.5 y=72.5, x=16.5 y=72.5, x=15.5 y=72.5, x=14.5 y=72.5) that connects the output inserter to the input inserter (inventory has iron ore)\n- Furnace (position x=19.0, y=71.0) to smelt iron ore into iron plates\n- Chest (position x=21.5, y=71.5) to collect iron plates\n- Burner Inserter (position x=20.5, y=71.5) to output iron plates into chest (currently facing left, pickup position x=21.5 y=71.5, drop position x=19.5 y=71.5)\n- Burner Inserter (position x=19.5, y=68.5) to transfer iron ore to furnace (currently facing left, pickup position x=20.5 y=68.5, drop position x=18.5 y=68.5)\n- BeltGroup (positions x=19.5 y=69.5, x=21.5 y=68.5, x=21.5 y=69.5, x=20.5 y=69.5) that connects the furnace output inserter to the output chest\n- BeltGroup (positions x=15.5 y=68.5, x=19.5 y=67.5) that connects the output inserter to the input inserter of furnace\n- BeltGroup (positions x=20.5 y=69.5, x=21.5 y=68.5) that connects the furnace output inserter to the output chest\n- BeltGroup (positions x=14.5 y=72.5, x=17.5 y=70.5) that connects the output inserter to the input inserter\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n* Errors when inserting items into furnaces without sufficient ingredients or when the furnace is not ready\n  - Check if the furnace has sufficient ingredients and is ready to accept more items before attempting to insert\n* Errors when inserters are not correctly oriented or are blocked\n  - Check the direction of inserters to ensure they are correctly picking up and dropping off items\n  - Clear any blockages that may be preventing inserters from functioning correctly\n* Errors when transport belts are blocked or not properly connected\n  - Clear any blockages on the transport belts to continue mining or processing\n  - Ensure that transport belts are properly connected to compatible entities (e.g., inserters, other transport belts)\n* Errors when attempting to insert items into entities that are not ready or are not compatible\n  - Verify that the target entity is ready to accept items and is compatible with the item being inserted\n* Errors when furnaces have no ingredients to smelt\n  - Ensure that furnaces have sufficient ingredients to smelt before attempting to smelt\n* All other error tips from the previous report remain relevant:\n  - Ensure sufficient spacing between entities to avoid collisions\n  - Use inserters to take items from source entities (e.g., chests, furnaces) before connecting to other entities\n  - Check if a position is occupied before attempting to place an entity\n  - Ensure that transport belts are connected to compatible entities (e.g., inserters, other transport belts)\n  - Avoid connecting transport belts directly to chests or other entities that do not support direct belt connections\n  - Ensure that 'return' statements are used within functions\n  - Ensure that variables are defined before use\n  - Verify that the position of the entity exists before attempting to retrieve it\n\n### NAMESPACE"}
