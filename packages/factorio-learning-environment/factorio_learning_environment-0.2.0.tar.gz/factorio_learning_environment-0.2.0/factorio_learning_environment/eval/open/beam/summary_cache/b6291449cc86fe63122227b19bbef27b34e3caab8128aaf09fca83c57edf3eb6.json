{"content": "I see the pattern now. The furnace appears to be completely full but showing empty contents. Let's try a different approach:\n\n1. Let's look at other furnaces on the map\n2. Find one that has iron plates we can extract\n3. Use those plates to craft what we need\n\n```python\n# Get all furnaces\nfurnaces = get_entities({Prototype.StoneFurnace})\nprint(f\"Found {len(furnaces)} furnaces\")\n\n# Check each furnace for iron plates\nfor furnace in furnaces:\n    move_to(furnace.position)\n    contents = inspect_inventory(furnace)\n    print(f\"Furnace at {furnace.position} contains: {contents}\")\n    \n    # If this furnace has iron plates, extract them\n    if Prototype.IronPlate in contents:\n        plates = contents[Prototype.IronPlate]\n        extract_item(Prototype.IronPlate, furnace.position, plates)\n        print(f\"Extracted {plates} iron plates\")\n        \n        # Check if we have enough plates now\n        my_inventory = inspect_inventory()\n        print(f\"Current inventory: {my_inventory}\")\n        \n        if my_inventory.get(Prototype.IronPlate, 0) >= 2:\n            print(\"We have enough plates to craft!\")\n            # Try to craft iron gear wheels\n            craft_item(Prototype.IronGearWheel, quantity=2)\n            print(f\"After crafting gears: {inspect_inventory()}\")\n            break\n\nprint(f\"Final inventory: {inspect_inventory()}\")\n```\n\nThis approach should:\n1. Find all furnaces\n2. Check each one for iron plates\n3. Extract any plates we find\n4. Craft gear wheels once we have enough plates\n5. Show us our final inventory\n\nLet's see if this helps us get the materials we need.", "summary_range": "[1-3552]"}
