{"content": "Based on the execution logs and entity data, here's the updated report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Plate Production Line\nConsists of three stone furnaces in a row:\n- Furnace 1 at position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Furnace 2 at position (2.0, 0.0)\n- Furnace 3 at position (4.0, 4.0)\nAll furnaces are processing copper ore into copper plates\n\n### Electricity Generation System\nLocated around position (-7.0, 24.5), consists of:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Boiler at (-7.0, 24.5)\n- Steam engine at (-2.5, 24.5)\n- Connected by pipe groups carrying water and steam\n- Electric pole network distributing power across the map\n\n### Copper Cable Production Line\nLocated around position (9.5, 11.5), consists of:\n- Assembling machine at (9.5, 11.5) producing copper cables\n- Two burner inserters:\n  - First at (7.5, 11.5) feeding from input chest\n  - Second at (11.5, 11.5) outputting to storage chest\n- Three wooden chests:\n  - Input chest at (6.5, 11.5) containing iron plates\n  - Output chest at (12.5, 11.5) containing mixed items\n  - Additional storage at (14.5, 11.5) and (16.5, 11.5)\n\n### Science Pack Handling System\nLocated around position (0.5, 30.5), consists of:\n- Lab for research\n- Burner inserter at (0.5, 30.5)\n- Storage chest at (0.5, 31.5) containing science packs\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Resource Management Errors\n- Ensure sufficient coal is available before attempting to insert into machines\n- Monitor coal levels in boilers and furnaces to maintain continuous operation\n\n### Assembly Machine Extraction Errors\n- Cannot extract copper cable from assembly machine when production cycle is not complete\n- Verify item availability before attempting extraction\n\n### Inventory Management\n- Monitor chest capacity to prevent overflow (wooden chest at 14.5, 11.5 is full)\n- Ensure proper resource distribution between input and output storage\n\n### Production Flow\n- Maintain consistent fuel supply to all burner devices\n- Keep raw material supply chains active to prevent \"no ingredients to smelt\" warnings in furnaces"}
