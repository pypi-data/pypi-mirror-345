{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at Position (-1.5, 24.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe Group connecting these entities, starting at Position (-9.5, 23.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (6.0, -62.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0)\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) connected to the electric network\n- Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5) for storage\n- Small Electric Poles for power distribution at various positions\n\n### Research Lab at Position (6.5, -57.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab at Position (6.5, -57.5) with automation science packs but no research in progress\n- Electricity Group at Position (6.6, -57.8) not plugged into the electric network\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Starting Research\n- Ensure that the lab is connected to the electric network and has the required science packs to start research.\n\n### Errors with Electrical Connections\n- Verify that all entities requiring power are properly connected to the electric network. Use small electric poles to extend the network as needed.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Power\n- Ensure inserters are connected to the electric network to function correctly. Check connections with nearby electric poles.\n\n### Errors with Unplugged Electricity Groups\n- Review the layout of electric poles to ensure all electricity groups are properly integrated into the network to maintain consistent power distribution."}
