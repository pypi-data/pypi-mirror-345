{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report (Updated)\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generation system at x=-25.0 y=80.5\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at x=-20.5 y=69.5 (now connected to pipe network)\n- Boiler at x=-25.0 y=80.5 (still not properly connected to steam system)\n- Steam engine at x=-25.5 y=89.5 (receiving some steam but not from boiler)\n- Pipe network now partially established but incomplete connections remain\n\n### Iron mining operation at x=15.5 y=70.5\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill at x=15.5 y=70.5 (output blocked)\n- Stone furnace at x=16.0 y=74.0 (missing from earlier steps, now present)\n- Burner inserter at x=15.5 y=72.5 (connecting drill and furnace)\n- Wooden chest at x=15.5 y=75.5 (empty output storage)\n\n### Copper mining operation at x=-46.5 y=70.5\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill at x=-46.5 y=70.5 (output blocked)\n- Stone furnace at x=-46.0 y=74.0 (present but no ingredients)\n- Burner inserter at x=-46.5 y=72.5 (connecting drill and furnace)\n- Wooden chest at x=-46.5 y=76.5 (empty output storage)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity verification failures\n- Verify entity existence before operations (repeated attempts to access non-existent furnaces and inserters)\n- Check entity positions before attempting modifications (multiple failed get_entity calls)\n\n### Placement issues\n- Ensure target position is clear before placing entities (failed furnace placement due to water)\n- Verify terrain suitability for placement (stone furnace placement failed in water)\n- Check for existing objects before placing inserters (burner inserter placement blocked)\n\n### Production chain problems\n- Clear output blockages on mining drills (both drills still show \"output blocked\" warnings)\n- Ensure proper fuel supply for burner inserters (some inserters have low coal)\n- Verify furnace ingredient supply (both furnaces show \"no ingredients to smelt\")\n\n### Power system issues\n- Complete boiler to steam engine connections (boiler still shows \"not connected\")\n- Verify proper pipe network connections (incomplete fluid connections persist)\n\n### Entity management\n- Maintain consistent entity tracking (apparent disappearance/reappearance of furnaces)\n- Verify inserter positions and connections (multiple failed inserter operations)\n\n### System verification\n- Implement pre-placement checks using can_place (could prevent many placement failures)\n- Verify system states before operations (fluid connections, power supply, etc.)"}
