# linked_list

An ordered [collection](/data_md/computer_science/definitions/data_structure/collection.md) of elements. Each element is stored in a [node](/data_md/mathematics/definitions/graph/node.md) that contains a reference to the next node in the list. Linked lists can be singly linked or doubly linked, depending on whether each node has a reference to the next node only or both the next and previous nodes.
