# OrangeQS Sphinx Extensions

Common Sphinx theme and extensions used internally by [Orange Quantum Systems](https://orangeqs.com) for building product documentation.

The Sphinx theme is an extension to [Pydata Sphinx Theme](https://pydata-sphinx-theme.readthedocs.io/) with adaptations to company branding.

## Usage

### Theme

- Add `orangeqs-sphinx-extensions` to your requirements.
- Copy the content of [`conf_default.py`](https://code.orangeqs.com/opensource/oqs-sphinx-theme/-/blob/main/conf_default.py)
  to your Sphinx's `conf.py` file, modifying where needed.
  In particular, replace `PATH_TO_YOUR_REPO` by the URL of your Gitlab repository. It should have the format `internal/wiki`.

### Generated API documentation

This package contains a Numpydoc parser for [`sphinx-autodoc2`](https://sphinx-autodoc2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
taken from [this issue comment](https://github.com/sphinx-extensions2/sphinx-autodoc2/issues/33#issuecomment-1817348449).
To use it, install this package with extra enabled:

```
pip install orangeqs-sphinx-extensions[autodoc2]
```

After that, configure `autodoc2` in Sphinx `conf.py`, for example:

```python
extensions = [
    ...,
    "autodoc2",
]
autodoc2_packages = ["../../PACKAGENAME"]
autodoc2_output_dir = "./api_reference"
autodoc2_render_plugin = "myst"
autodoc2_docstring_parser_regexes = [
    (
        ".*",
        "orangeqs.sphinx.autodoc2.numpydoc",
    ),
]
```

and add `api_reference/index` to toctree.

For more details on configuration, see [documentation](https://sphinx-autodoc2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) of `sphinx-autodoc2`
