Repeated failures in crafting pipes and inserting coal indicate that insufficient resources can cascade into multiple operational errors.\n\u2003\u2013 Continuously monitor inventory levels to prevent crafting and placement attempts with missing items.\n\n\u2022 Pipe Crafting and Fluid Connection:\n\u2003\u2013 Verify that the planned pipe connection has enough pipe items available. Multiple attempts to connect the Boiler at (x=-2.0, y=15.5) with the Steam Engine at (x=11.5, y=13.5) failed due to requiring 61 pipes while crafting batches yielded fewer items.\n\u2003\u2013 Harvest and smelt additional resources as needed to meet the minimum component requirements for large-scale pipe crafting.\n\n\u2022 Electrical Network and Connection Management:\n\u2003\u2013 Confirm that the target positions for electric poles and network connections are unoccupied and supported by sufficient inventory. Reconnection of the Lab to the Electric Pole (now successfully at (x=16.5, y=13.5)) was achieved by addressing previous shortages.\n\u2003\u2013 Maintain accurate entity references to prevent connection failures related to missing or misdirected components.\n\n\u2022 General Error Handling:\n\u2003\u2013 Validate computed buildable positions and pre-check that target tiles are free of obstructions.\n\u2003\u2013 Keep inventory records consistently updated after each crafting and placement attempt to avoid referencing unavailable resources."}
