{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position (10, 0)\nConsists of:\n- Steam engine (position 10, 0) \n\n### Copper plate mine at position (1, 1)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (position 1, 1) and a furnace (position 1, 1)\n\n### Offshore pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump (position -9.5, 24.5)\n\n### Pipe group\nConsists of:\n- Multiple pipes forming a fluid system connected to the offshore pump.\n\n### Electricity group\nConsists of:\n- Small electric poles at various positions including (55.5, 44.5), (22.5, 47.5), (46.5, 46.5), and others.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when retrieving steam engine\n- Ensure that the steam engine is placed at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it. If the entity is not found, verify its existence on the map.\n\n### Errors when placing electric poles\n- Ensure that the target location for placing the small electric pole is free of obstructions. If the terrain is unplaceable (e.g., water), select a different location.\n\n### Errors when inserting coal into steam engine\n- Confirm that the steam engine is nearby and can accept coal before attempting to insert. If it is not accepting coal, check if the steam engine is powered and operational.\n\n### Errors with blocking entities\n- Regularly check for and remove any blocking entities that may obstruct connection points for electricity or other structures."}
