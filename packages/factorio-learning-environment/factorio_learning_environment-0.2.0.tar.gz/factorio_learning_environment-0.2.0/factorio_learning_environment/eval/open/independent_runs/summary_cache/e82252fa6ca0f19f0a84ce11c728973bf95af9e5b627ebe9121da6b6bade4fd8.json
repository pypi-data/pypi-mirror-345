{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position (x=0, y=0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam engine (position x=0, y=1)\n- Boiler (position x=0, y=2)\n- Offshore pump (position x=-9.5, y=24.5)\n\n### Copper plate mine at position (x=1, y=1)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position x=1.0, y=1.0) and a furnace (position x=1.0, y=2.0)\n- Burner mining drill (position x=10.0, y=1.0) and a furnace (position x=10.0, y=2.0)\n\n### Copper cable factory at position (x=8, y=1)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine (position x=8.5, y=1.5) and inserter (position x=8.5, y=1.5) that puts into assembling machine\n- Beltgroup (position x=8.5, y=1.5) that connects the furnace at position x=1.0, y=2.0 to assembling machine at position x=8.5, y=1.5\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing electric poles\n- Electric poles cannot be placed at (x=52.5, y=49.0) and (x=52.5, y=54.0) due to blocking entities or unplaceable terrain (water). Ensure the area is clear of obstructions before attempting to place poles.\n\n### Errors when inserting coal into steam engine\n- Failed to insert coal into the steam engine due to the absence of a nearby entity that can accept coal. Verify the proximity of the steam engine to the coal source and ensure that the inserter is correctly positioned to transfer coal.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items. \n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
