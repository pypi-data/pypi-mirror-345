{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Iron Ore Extraction and Processing Facility\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, y=-60.0) connected to a **Wooden Chest** at position (4.5, y=-58.5) for iron ore collection.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-15.0, y=-48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Storage Area\n- Multiple **Wooden Chests** at various positions for storing iron plates and other resources:\n  - Wooden Chests at positions (-14.5, y=-50.5), (-13.5, y=-50.5), (-12.5, y=-50.5), (-11.5, y=-50.5), (-10.5, y=-50.5), (-9.5, y=-50.5), (-8.5, y=-50.5), (-7.5, y=-50.5), (-6.5, y=-50.5).\n  - **Iron Chest** at position (-5.5, y=-50.5) currently holding 100 iron plates.\n\n### Iron Plate Smelting Facility\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (-15.0, y=-48.0), (-13.0, y=-48.0), and (-11.0, y=-48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n  - Furnace at (-15.0, y=-48.0) is operational with iron ore.\n  - Furnaces at (-13.0, y=-48.0) and (-11.0, y=-48.0) are without ingredients to smelt.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors due to Lack of Resources\n- Ensure sufficient coal is available in the inventory before attempting to refuel drills or furnaces.\n\n### Errors when Extracting from Non-Existent Entities\n- Verify the presence of the target entity and its contents before attempting to extract items.\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities on Occupied Tiles\n- Check if the target position is free of other entities before placing a new entity to avoid placement errors.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - `extract_item`: Used to extract items from a specified entity. Ensure the entity exists and contains the desired items to avoid extraction errors.\n  \n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `extracted_iron_ore`: Intended to store iron ore extracted from a chest; ensure the chest contains iron ore before assignment.\n  - `current_inventory`: Dictionary tracking current inventory levels, including 'wood', 'coal', 'iron-plate', and 'iron-gear-wheel'."}
