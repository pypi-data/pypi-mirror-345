If an entity already exists at the desired position, consider adjusting the spacing or changing the reference position.\n\n### Errors when connecting entities with transport belts\n- Verify that the entities you are attempting to connect with transport belts are valid and accessible. Ensure that the starting and ending positions are correctly specified and that the entities are within a connectable range."}
