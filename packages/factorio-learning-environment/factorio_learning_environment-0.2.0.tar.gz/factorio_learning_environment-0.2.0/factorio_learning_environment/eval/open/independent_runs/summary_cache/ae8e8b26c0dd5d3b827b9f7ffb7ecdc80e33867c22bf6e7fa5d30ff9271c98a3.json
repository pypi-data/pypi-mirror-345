{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=18.5, y=46.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Steam Engine** at position (x=18.5, y=46.5)\n- **Boiler** at position (x=-4.5, y=25.0)\n- **Offshore Pump** at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\n- **PipeGroup** connecting the boiler and steam engine, starting at position (x=-4.5, y=23.5) and ending at position (x=18.5, y=43.5)\n\n### Stone Furnace at Position (x=-10.0, y=-50.0)\n- **Furnace** at position (x=-10.0, y=-50.0) with warnings of being out of fuel and having no ingredients to smelt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Accessing Entity Attributes\n- Ensure that when accessing attributes of entities, the correct data types are used. Avoid using `ModelPrivateAttr` directly as it is not compatible with `int()` conversion.\n\n### Errors When Placing Entities\n- Verify the placement location is clear of obstacles and not over water before attempting to place entities like the steam engine. Adjust the position to ensure the terrain is suitable.\n\n### Connection Errors Between Entities\n- Ensure you have the required items, such as pipes, in your inventory before attempting to connect entities like the boiler and steam engine.\n- Check that all necessary connections are made between entities to ensure proper functionality, such as connecting the offshore pump to the boiler.\n\n### Fuel and Resource Management Errors\n- Maintain a sufficient inventory of necessary resources like coal to refuel entities such as boilers.\n- Ensure that all entities requiring fuel are adequately supplied to prevent interruptions in operation.\n\n### Assertion Errors in Energy Generation\n- Verify that all components of the energy generation system are correctly connected and operational to ensure the steam engine generates power. Check for any warnings or errors in the status of each component.\n\n### General Connectivity Issues\n- Regularly check the status of all entities to ensure they are connected to the necessary networks, such as fluid or power networks, to avoid operational failures."}
