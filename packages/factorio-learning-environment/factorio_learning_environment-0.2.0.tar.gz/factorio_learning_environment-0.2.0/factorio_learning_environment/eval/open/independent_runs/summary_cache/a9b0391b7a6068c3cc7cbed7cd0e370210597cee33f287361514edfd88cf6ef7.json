{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) with a drop position at (-14.5, -48.5). It is connected to:\n  - **Iron Chest** at position (-16.5, -48.5) containing iron ore.\n  - **Iron Chest** at position (-15.5, -48.5) currently empty.\n  - **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5) containing iron ore.\n  - **Iron Chest** at position (-13.5, -49.5) currently empty.\n  - **Stone Furnace** at position (-13.0, -48.0) with coal as fuel, processing iron ore into iron plates.\n  - **Stone Furnace** at position (-11.0, -48.0) with coal as fuel, processing iron ore into iron plates.\n  - **Stone Furnace** at position (-9.0, -48.0) with coal as fuel, processing iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Coal Storage and Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Iron Chest** at position (47.5, -80.5) storing coal.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (41.5, -78.5), waiting for source items, connected to:\n  - **Wooden Chest** at position (41.5, -79.5) containing coal.\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (41.0, -82.0) with a drop position at (41.5, -80.5), connected to:\n  - **Stone Furnace** at position (43.0, -82.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n  - **Iron Chest** at position (41.5, -80.5) currently empty.\n  - **Iron Chest** at position (42.5, -80.5) containing iron plates.\n  - **Burner Inserter** at position (43.5, -80.5) working, transferring items between chests and furnaces.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the connected supply chain is complete and that the inserter has access to source items. Check if the connected chest or source entity has the necessary items for the inserter to operate.\n\n### Burner Mining Drill Out of Fuel\n- Regularly refuel burner mining drills to ensure continuous operation. Monitor fuel levels and replenish as needed to avoid interruptions in resource extraction.\n\n### Chest at Drop Position is Full\n- Regularly clear or manage the inventory of chests at drop positions to prevent mining drills from halting due to full storage. Consider expanding storage capacity or improving logistics to handle excess resources efficiently."}
