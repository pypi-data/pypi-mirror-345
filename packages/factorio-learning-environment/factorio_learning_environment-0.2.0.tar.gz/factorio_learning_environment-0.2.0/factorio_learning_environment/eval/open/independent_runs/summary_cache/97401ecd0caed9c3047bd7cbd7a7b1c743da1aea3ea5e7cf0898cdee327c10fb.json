{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Structure\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n  - Extracts iron ore and deposits it into a wooden chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Stores iron ore extracted by the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\n  - Smelts iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Placement\n- Ensure there is enough space and no blocking entities when placing an inserter. Consider adjusting the spacing, direction, or reference position to avoid collisions.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Iron Ore\n- Regularly check the alignment and functionality of inserters to ensure they are correctly positioned to transfer materials from the chest to the furnace.\n\n### Refueling Issues\n- Monitor fuel levels in the burner mining drill and inserters to prevent interruptions in operation due to lack of fuel."}
