{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0) to (-9.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0), extracting iron ore and dropping into:\n  - **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5), storing extracted iron ore.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-13.0, -48.0), smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-11.0, -48.0), newly placed, intended for additional smelting capacity.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-9.0, -48.0), newly placed, intended for additional smelting capacity.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-14.5, -46.5), transferring items from the chest to the stone furnace at (-13.0, -48.0).\n\n### Coal Mining and Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (41.0, -82.0), extracting coal and dropping into:\n  - **Wooden Chest** at position (41.5, -80.5), storing extracted coal.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (43.0, -82.0), smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (43.5, -80.5), transferring items to the stone furnace at (43.0, -82.0).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Insufficient Inventory for Insertion\n- Ensure that you have enough iron ore in your inventory before attempting to insert it into a furnace. This will prevent errors related to insufficient items for insertion.\n\n### Errors When Placing into a Tile Which is Occupied by Another Entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placement. This will prevent errors related to overlapping entities.\n\n### Errors Due to Full Storage\n- Regularly check and empty the chests at drop positions to avoid mining interruptions due to full storage. This will ensure continuous operation of mining drills.\n\n### Errors When Using Extracting but Being Too Far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items. This will prevent errors related to being out of range for extraction."}
