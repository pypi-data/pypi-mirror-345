{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) mining iron ore and dropping into a chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-15.5, -51.5) storing iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-14.5, -51.5) intended to transfer iron ore from the chest but currently blocked.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at position (62.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (62.0, -53.0) intended for smelting iron ore into iron plates but currently without ingredients.\n- Burner Inserter at position (63.5, -52.5) intended to supply the furnace with iron ore but waiting for source items.\n- Burner Inserter at position (60.5, -52.5) waiting for source items.\n\n### Coal Supply Network\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Multiple Burner Inserters at positions (-14.5, -51.5), (-12.5, -50.5), (60.5, -52.5), and (63.5, -52.5) supplied with coal to power various structures.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Ensure Resource Availability\n- Ensure that there is sufficient iron ore in the chest at position (-15.5, -51.5) to keep the production line running. Regularly check and refill resource supplies to avoid production halts.\n\n### Address Inserter Fuel and Source Item Issues\n- Ensure that all inserters are adequately fueled and have access to source items. Regularly check inserters for fuel levels and ensure they are not waiting for source items unnecessarily.\n\n### Manage Output Blockages\n- Ensure that the output of the burner inserter at position (-14.5, -51.5) is not blocked. Ensure there is a sink entity or clear any items on the ground that may be blocking the output.\n\n### Check for Ingredient Shortages\n- Regularly check the stone furnace for ingredient shortages and ensure it has the necessary inputs to produce iron plates."}
