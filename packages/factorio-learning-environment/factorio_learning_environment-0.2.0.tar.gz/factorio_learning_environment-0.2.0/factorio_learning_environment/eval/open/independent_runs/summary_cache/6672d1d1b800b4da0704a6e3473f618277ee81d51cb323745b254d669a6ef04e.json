{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\n- **Iron Ore Mining Site at Position (-14.0, -53.0):**\n  - Consists of a Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) with a drop position at (-14.5, -54.5).\n  - Connected to a wooden chest at position (-14.5, -54.5) and another at (-12.5, -54.5).\n  - A Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5) with a pickup position at (-13.5, -53.5) and drop position at (-13.5, -55.5), currently waiting for space in the destination.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Processing Facility\n- **Copper Ore Mining Site at Position (-23.0, -68.0):**\n  - Consists of a Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) with a drop position at (-23.5, -69.5), currently out of fuel.\n  - Connected to a wooden chest at position (-23.5, -69.5) and another at (-24.5, -67.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Processing Facility\n- **Iron Plate Processing Site at Position (-20.0, -70.0):**\n  - Consists of a Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -70.0) with warnings of no ingredients to smelt and fuel source full.\n  - Connected to a wooden chest at position (-17.5, -69.5) and another at (-15.5, -69.5).\n  - A Burner Inserter at position (-16.5, -69.5) with a pickup position at (-16.5, -68.5) and drop position at (-16.5, -70.5), waiting for source items.\n\n### Copper Plate Processing Facility\n- **Copper Plate Processing Site at Position (0.0, 0.0) and (5.0, 0.0):**\n  - Consists of Stone Furnaces at positions (0.0, 0.0) and (5.0, 0.0) with warnings of no ingredients to smelt.\n  - Connected to multiple wooden chests in the vicinity.\n\n### Transport Belt Network\n- **Belt Network:**\n  - BeltGroup connecting positions (1.5, 1.5) to (3.5, 1.5) and (2.5, 1.5) to (4.5, 1.5).\n  - Another BeltGroup connecting positions (3.5, 2.5) to (5.5, 2.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Inserter Placement\n- Ensure that the drop position of an inserter matches the position of the intended receiving chest to avoid misalignment issues.\n\n### TypeError: 'Chest' object is not callable\n- When using the `pickup_entity` function, ensure that the correct syntax and parameters are used. The entity should not be treated as a callable object.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source items are available for the inserter to pick up. Check the inventory of the source entity to verify availability.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Space in Destination\n- Ensure that the destination entity has enough space to accommodate the items being transferred by the inserter. Regularly check and clear the destination inventory if necessary."}
