Multiple attempts were made to craft and place a Lab at position (0.5, 2.5), but none succeeded because the Lab item was unavailable. Instead, processing operations were carried out using pre\u2010existing smelting facilities (for example, a furnace at Position(x=5.0, y=5.0) for iron smelting and a copper furnace at Position(x=-27.0, y=-60.0) for copper processing). These facilities are accessed for resource conversion but were not constructed by the agent.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 API Call Parameter Issues \u2013 Incorrect use of get_entities():\n  - Avoid using unsupported keyword arguments like \"radius\".\n  - Do not pass positional parameters if the function expects none; verify the function signature before calling.\n  \n\u2022 Entity Availability and Placement Problems\n  - Ensure that an entity (e.g. Lab) is available in the inventory before attempting placement.\n  \n\u2022 Iteration Over Undefined Collections\n  - Check that objects returned (for example, from get_entities) are not None before iterating; use a fallback to an empty list if necessary.\n  \n\u2022 Crafting and Resource Chain Shortfalls\n  - Confirm that all required sub-ingredients (such as iron-gear-wheel, electronic-circuit, and copper-cable) are available or can be produced before starting complex crafting.\n  - Validate resource counts and production prerequisites (like sufficient smelted products) to support crafting recipes and avoid cascading failures."}
