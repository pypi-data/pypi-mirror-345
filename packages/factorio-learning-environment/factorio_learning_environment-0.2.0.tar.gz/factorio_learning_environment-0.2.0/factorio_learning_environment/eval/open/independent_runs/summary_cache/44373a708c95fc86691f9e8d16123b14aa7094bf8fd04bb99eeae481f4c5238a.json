Move closer to the target position before attempting to place the entity.\n\n### Errors when placing entities with potential collisions\n- Before placing an entity, verify that the target position is clear of other entities or obstacles. Consider adjusting the spacing, direction, or reference position to avoid collisions.\n\n### Errors due to misalignment of inserters\n- Ensure that the inserter's pickup and drop positions are correctly aligned with the intended source and destination entities. Reposition the inserter if necessary to ensure proper alignment.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient inventory items\n- Verify that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into other entities. Ensure your inventory is stocked with necessary resources.\n\n### Errors due to blocked outputs\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity in place to accept outputs from entities like mining drills to prevent blockage warnings."}
