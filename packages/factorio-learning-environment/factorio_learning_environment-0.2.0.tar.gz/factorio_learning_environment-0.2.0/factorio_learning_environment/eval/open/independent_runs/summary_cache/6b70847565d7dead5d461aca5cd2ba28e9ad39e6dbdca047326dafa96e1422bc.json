{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Smelting Setup at position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n- Ensure to start building basic structures such as electricity generators and mining setups to progress in the game.\n- Consider placing mining drills and furnaces to start processing resources like iron ore and coal.\n- Remember to position yourself close to entities when interacting with them to avoid errors related to distance.\n- Ensure you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to place structures. For example, ensure you have a stone furnace available before trying to place it.\n- Gather raw resources such as stone directly from the environment, as they cannot be crafted. Ensure you have enough raw materials before attempting to craft items that require them.\n- To avoid the \"no ingredients to smelt\" warning in furnaces, ensure that both fuel and smeltable items are present in the furnace. Check inventory levels and supply the furnace with the required resources to maintain continuous operation.\n- Regularly monitor the furnace's status to ensure it is operating efficiently. Address any warnings such as \"no ingredients to smelt\" by supplying necessary resources promptly.\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to place them on the map. For example, ensure you have a burner mining drill in your inventory before trying to place it.\n- When crafting items, ensure you have all necessary sub-ingredients available. For example, iron plates cannot be crafted directly and must be smelted in a furnace. Ensure you have enough iron plates before attempting to craft items that require them, such as iron gear wheels.\n- When attempting to craft a burner mining drill, ensure you have the required amount of iron plates and stone furnaces in your inventory. Iron plates must be smelted in a furnace, and stone is a raw resource that must be gathered directly from the environment."}
