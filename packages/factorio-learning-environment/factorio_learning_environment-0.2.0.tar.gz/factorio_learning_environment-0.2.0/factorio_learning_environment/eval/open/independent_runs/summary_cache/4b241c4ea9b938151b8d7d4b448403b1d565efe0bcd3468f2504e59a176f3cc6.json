{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0): This drill is responsible for extracting iron ore and is currently fueled with coal. It is connected to a wooden chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5): This chest stores extracted iron ore and iron plates. It is connected to the burner mining drill and the burner inserter.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5): This inserter transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the stone furnace. It is fueled with coal.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0): This furnace processes iron ore into iron plates. It is fueled with coal and currently contains iron ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Insufficient Fuel Management\n- Ensure that there is enough coal in the inventory to refuel all necessary entities like mining drills, inserters, and furnaces to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Inefficient Resource Transfer\n- Ensure that inserters are correctly aligned and positioned to transfer resources efficiently between entities. Reposition them if necessary to avoid bottlenecks.\n\n### Full Storage Management\n- Regularly check and empty the storage chests to prevent mining drills from halting due to full storage, ensuring continuous resource extraction.\n\n### Furnace Production Stoppage\n- Monitor the furnace's input to ensure it has a continuous supply of iron ore for processing. Avoid manual extraction unless necessary to maintain automated production flow."}
