{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-46.5, -119.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (-40.5, -113.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting these entities, with various pipes at positions including (-47.5, -122.5), (-46.5, -122.5), and others.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-15.0, -76.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at Position (-15.5, -77.5)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-19.0, -73.0)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0)\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) connected to a Wooden Chest at Position (6.5, -59.5)\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-19.0, -73.0)\n\n### Storage and Research Facilities\n- Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5) storing iron plates\n- Wooden Chest at Position (6.5, -59.5) storing iron and copper plates\n- Lab with no research in progress\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- Multiple PipeGroups at various positions, including (-48.5, -121.5), (-42.5, -120.5), and others, some of which are empty.\n\n### Electricity Network\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at various positions, including (-24.5, -81.5), (-3.5, -80.5), and others.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure that the pipe connections are correctly aligned and that there are no obstructions or incorrect positions when attempting to connect pipes between entities. Double-check the coordinates and ensure that the pipes are placed correctly to establish a connection.\n\n### Errors with Steam Engine Connection\n- Verify that the steam engine is properly connected to the power network and that there is a continuous flow of steam from the boiler. Ensure that all necessary pipes are in place and correctly connected to allow steam to reach the steam engine.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Power Supply\n- Make sure that inserters are connected to a power source. Check the electricity network to ensure that all poles and connections are intact and providing power to the inserters."}
