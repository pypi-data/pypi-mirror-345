{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=20.5, y=-4.0)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (x=22.5, y=-7.5)\n- Boiler at Position (x=20.5, y=-4.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (x=19.5, y=-1.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting these entities, facilitating steam and water transport\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (x=-11.0, y=20.0) with a Wooden Chest at Position (x=-11.5, y=18.5) for iron ore storage\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=2.0, y=0.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility at Position (x=5.0, y=5.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (x=20.0, y=20.0) with a Wooden Chest at Position (x=19.5, y=18.5) for copper ore storage\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=5.0, y=5.0) for smelting copper ore into copper plates\n\n### Copper Cable Factory\nConsists of:\n- Assembling Machine at Position (x=10.5, y=0.5) for producing copper cables\n- Inserter at Position (x=9.5, y=5.5) that feeds copper plates into the assembling machine\n- BeltGroup connecting the furnace at Position (x=5.0, y=5.0) to the assembling machine at Position (x=10.5, y=0.5)\n\n### Storage Facility\nConsists of:\n- Wooden Chest at Position (x=-3.5, y=2.5) storing iron plates and iron ore\n- Inserter at Position (x=-3.5, y=1.5) for moving items between chests\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Missing Resources\n- Ensure that all required resources are available before attempting to craft items in assembling machines. For example, the assembling machine at Position (x=10.5, y=0.5) is missing copper plates to produce copper cables.\n\n### Errors When Inserters Are Waiting for Source Items\n- Make sure that inserters have access to source items to avoid idle status. For instance, the inserter at Position (x=-3.5, y=1.5) is waiting for source items.\n\n### Errors When Boilers Run Out of Fuel\n- Regularly refuel boilers to maintain continuous energy production. The boiler at Position (x=20.5, y=-4.0) was reported as out of fuel.\n\n### Errors When Furnace Output is Full\n- Regularly extract items from furnaces to prevent them from halting production due to full output. The furnace at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0) was reported as having a full output."}
