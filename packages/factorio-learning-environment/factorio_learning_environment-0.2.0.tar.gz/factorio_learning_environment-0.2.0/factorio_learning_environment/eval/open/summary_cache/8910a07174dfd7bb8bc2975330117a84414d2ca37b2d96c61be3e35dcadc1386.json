{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron ore mining and smelting setup at approximately (16.0, 71.0) to (18.5, 75.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (16.0, 71.0) fueled with coal, extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden chest at position (16.5, 72.5) collecting iron ore from the mining drill.\n- Stone furnace at position (18.0, 73.0) intended for smelting iron ore into iron plates; currently fueled with coal but has no iron ore input.\n- Burner inserter at position (18.5, 74.5) extracting iron plates from the furnace; currently out of fuel and waiting.\n- Inserter at position (16.5, 73.5) intended to feed iron ore from the chest into the furnace (misalignment issues reported).\n- Wooden chest at position (18.5, 75.5) collecting iron plates output from the furnace.\n- Small electric poles nearby (positions around 17.5, 71.5 and 19.5, 73.5) providing electricity to inserters and related entities.\n\nThis structure forms a basic iron ore mining and smelting line with fuel supply to the mining drill and furnace, and inserters to move items between entities.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to incorrect direction argument when placing entities\n- When placing entities that require a direction parameter, ensure the argument is a Direction enum object, not a raw integer or other type. Use the correct Direction enum values to avoid ValueError.\n\n### Errors placing inserters next to entities due to collision or invalid terrain\n- Placement attempts for burner inserters next to the wooden chest at (16.5, 72.5) failed due to collisions with the mining drill at (16, 71) or unplaceable terrain (water).\n- To mitigate, increase spacing when placing inserters, try alternative directions, or adjust reference positions to avoid collisions and invalid tiles.\n\n### Errors connecting electric poles between entities\n- Failure to connect small electric poles between the stone furnace and burner inserter due to nil or missing references.\n- Ensure entities passed to connection functions are valid and properly instantiated before attempting to connect poles.\n\n### Errors inserting items due to empty inventory or no available items\n- Attempted to insert coal into the furnace failed because no coal was available in inventory at that moment.\n- Confirm sufficient inventory quantity before inserting items to avoid exceptions.\n\n### Fuel management and inserter alignment issues\n- Inserters feeding the furnace were misaligned, causing replacement attempts.\n- Verify inserter pickup and drop positions align correctly with source and target entities to ensure smooth item transfer.\n\nNAMESPACE\nNo user-defined functions have been defined by the agent so far."}
