{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Coal mining operation at position(41, -82)\nConsists of a burner mining drill at position (41, -82) with a fuel source of coal, a wooden chest at position (40.5, -83.5) for coal storage, and another wooden chest at position (41.5, -83.5) for additional coal storage. The mining drill is connected to a burner inserter at position (39.5, -81.5) which is waiting for source items.\n\n### Furnace at position(0, 0)\nConsists of a stone furnace at position (0, 0) with a fuel source of coal and a capacity of 50 items. The furnace is currently not smelting any items due to a lack of ingredients.\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n* **Errors when extracting items from a chest**: Ensure that the chest is not full before attempting to extract items. Check the chest's inventory before extracting items.\n* **Errors when inserting items into a furnace**: Ensure that the furnace is not full before attempting to insert items. Check the furnace's inventory before inserting items.\n* **Errors when inserting items into a mining drill**: Ensure that the mining drill's fuel source is not full before attempting to insert items. Check the mining drill's fuel source before inserting items.\n* **Errors due to full chests**: Empty the chest at the specified position to continue mining or other operations.\n\n# NAMESPACE\n* **Important variables**:\n  + `coal_chest`: a wooden chest for coal storage\n  + `iron_chest`: a wooden chest for iron storage\n  + `drill`: a burner mining drill for coal mining\n  + `inserter`: a burner inserter for item transportation\n  + `furnace`: a stone furnace for item smelting\n* **Utility functions**:\n  + `extract_item`: a function to extract items from a chest\n  + `insert_item`: a function to insert items into a furnace or mining drill\n  + `get_inventory`: a function to get the inventory of a chest or furnace\n  + `get_status`: a function to get the status of a drill, inserter, or furnace"}
