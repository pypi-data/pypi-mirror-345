{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of a stone furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with iron ore as input and iron plates as output.\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (3.0, 0.0)\nConsists of a stone furnace at position (3.0, 0.0) with copper ore as input and copper plates as output.\n\n### Electric Furnace at position (0.5, 3.5)\nConsists of an electric furnace at position (0.5, 3.5) with no power connection and no ingredients.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n- Errors when checking research progress when no research is in progress\n  - Ensure that research is started before checking progress.\n- Errors when setting research to a technology that is already researched\n  - Check if a technology is already researched before attempting to set it as the current research.\n- Errors when crafting items that require a crafting machine or furnace\n  - Ensure that the required crafting machine or furnace is available and properly set up before attempting to craft items.\n- Errors when using incorrect keyword arguments in API calls\n  - Check the API documentation to ensure that the correct keyword arguments are being used. For example, the `extract_item` function does not have a `position` keyword argument.\n- Errors when crafting items without sufficient ingredients\n  - Ensure that all required ingredients are available before attempting to craft items.\n- Errors when attempting to access an entity that does not exist\n  - Ensure that the entity exists at the specified position before attempting to access it. For example, the error in Step 22 occurred because there was no electric furnace at position (0, 3).\n- Errors when attempting to access a steam engine that does not exist\n  - Ensure that a steam engine exists at the specified position before attempting to access it. For example, the error in Step 23 occurred because there was no steam engine at position (10, 10).\n\n### NAMESPACE\nNo utility functions have been defined by the agent."}
