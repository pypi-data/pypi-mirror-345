{"content": "# Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=-1.5, y=24.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Boiler at position (x=-1.5, y=24.0)\n- Steam engine at position (x=5.5, y=21.5)\n- Offshore pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting offshore pump to boiler with water at positions [(x=-8.5, y=23.5), (x=-9.5, y=23.5), (x=-6.5, y=23.5), ..., (x=-5.5, y=23.5), (x=-3.5, y=23.5), (x=-3.5, y=24.5)]\n- PipeGroup connecting boiler to steam engine with steam at positions [(x=-0.5, y=22.5), (x=-1.5, y=22.5), (x=1.5, y=22.5), ..., (x=3.5, y=24.5), (x=5.5, y=24.5), (x=4.5, y=24.5)]\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with copper-plate production capabilities\n\n### Research Lab Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab with input for automation science packs and connected to the electricity network\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Attribute Errors in Code\n- Ensure that the attributes you are trying to access exist for the object. For example, `Prototype.Boiler.entity_class.tile_dimensions` may not be a valid attribute.\n\n### Type Errors with Unsupported Operations\n- When performing arithmetic operations, ensure that the operands are of compatible types. For example, avoid adding an integer to a non-numeric attribute like `ModelPrivateAttr`.\n\n### Inventory Management Errors\n- Before attempting to connect entities that require items (e.g., pipes, electric poles), ensure that you have the necessary items in your inventory.\n- Regularly check inventory levels to ensure you have sufficient materials for crafting and refueling.\n\n### Connection Errors\n- When connecting entities like steam engines and labs, ensure that you have the required items (e.g., SmallElectricPole) and that the entities are correctly positioned and accessible.\n\n### Crafting Errors\n- Verify that you have enough materials to craft required items. For example, ensure you have enough copper plates to craft copper cables.\n\n### Name Errors in Code\n- Double-check variable names for typos or undefined variables. For instance, ensure that `copper_cable_needed_for_poles` is defined before use.\n\n### Entity Status Errors\n- Regularly check the status of entities like furnaces and generators to ensure they are not out of fuel or missing input materials."}
