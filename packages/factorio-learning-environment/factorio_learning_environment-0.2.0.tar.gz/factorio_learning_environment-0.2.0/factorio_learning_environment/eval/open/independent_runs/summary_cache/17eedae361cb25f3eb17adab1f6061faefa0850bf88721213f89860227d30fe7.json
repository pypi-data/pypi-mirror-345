{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) extracting iron ore, connected to:\n  - **Wooden Chest** at position (-15.5, -48.5) and another at (-14.5, -48.5) for temporary storage.\n  - **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5) transferring ore to:\n    - **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates. This furnace is currently full and unable to process more due to a blocked output.\n    - **Stone Furnace** at position (-10.0, -48.0) which is currently inactive due to lack of ingredients.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Wooden Chests** for storing iron plates:\n  - At position (-6.5, -49.5) and (-5.5, -48.5), both are full with 1600 iron plates each.\n  - At position (-6.5, -48.5) with 1500 iron plates.\n  - At position (-7.5, -48.5) with 60 iron plates.\n  - At position (-10.5, -46.5) with 1140 iron plates, regularly receiving iron plates from furnaces.\n\n### Iron Ore Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-14.5, -47.5) transferring iron ore from:\n  - **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5) to:\n  - **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -46.5) which currently holds 134 iron ore.\n\n### Additional Storage\n- **Wooden Chests** at various positions for additional storage:\n  - At position (-6.5, -47.5) with 465 iron plates.\n  - At position (-7.5, -47.5) currently empty.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Full Output in Furnaces\n- Ensure that the output of furnaces is not blocked by full chests or inserters waiting for space. Regularly check and clear the output to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Verify that the source items are available for inserters to pick up. This can be caused by empty chests or blocked paths.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Space in Destination\n- Ensure that there is adequate space in the destination for inserters to drop items. This can be managed by regularly clearing output chests or ensuring downstream processes are consuming items efficiently.\n\n### No Space Available for New Storage Chests\n- Optimize the arrangement of existing chests and consider expanding storage capacity by rearranging or adding new chests in available space.\n\n### No Ingredients to Smelt in Furnaces\n- Ensure that furnaces have a constant supply of ingredients to maintain production. This may involve checking the supply chain and ensuring that mining drills and inserters are functioning properly."}
