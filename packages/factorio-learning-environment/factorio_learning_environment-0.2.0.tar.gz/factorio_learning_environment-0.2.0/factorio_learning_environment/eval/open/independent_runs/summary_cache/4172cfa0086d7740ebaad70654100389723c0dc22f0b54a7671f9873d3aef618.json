{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-0.5, -9.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam engine at position (-0.5, -9.5)\n- Boiler at position (-4.5, 23.0)\n- Offshore pump at position (not specified)\n\n### Lab at position(5.5, -12.5)\nConsists of the following entity:\n- Lab at position (5.5, -12.5)\n\n### Pipe groups\nConsists of the following entities:\n- PipeGroup at position (-8.5, -6.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (-7.5, -7.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (-11.5, -4.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (-9.5, -5.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (-13.5, 23.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (-17.5, 25.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (-19.5, 27.5)\n\n### Electricity network\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Electric pole at position (-2.9878048780487805, 1.5)\n- Multiple small electric poles at various positions\n\n### Furnaces\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Stone furnace at position (5.0, 5.0)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting boiler to steam engine\n- Ensure there are no placement blockages when attempting to connect pipes between the boiler and steam engine. Check the surrounding area for any obstructing entities.\n\n### Errors with electric pole connections\n- Verify that electric poles are properly connected to the electric network. If an electric pole is not plugged in, check the connections and ensure they are within range of the power source.\n\n### Errors with lab power supply\n- Ensure that the lab is connected to a power source. If the lab status indicates \"no power,\" check the connections to nearby electric poles.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity on a tile before attempting to place it. Check for existing entities that may block placement."}
