{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Copper plate mine at position(41, -82)\nConsists of following entities\n-  Burner mining drill (position x=41.0, y=-82.0) and a furnace at position(x=41.0, y=-80.0)\n-  Burner inserter (position x=39.5, y=-79.5) that puts items into the furnace\n-  Belt group that connects the furnace to the burner mining drill\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(60, -60)\nConsists of following entities\n-  Furnace (position x=60.0, y=-60.0)\n\n### Electricity generator at position(117, -30)\nConsists of following entities\n-  Steam engine (position x=117.5, y=-30.5)\n-  Boiler (position x=111.5, y=-32.0)\n-  Offshore pump (position x=106.5, y=-32.5)\n-  Pipe group that connects the offshore pump to the boiler\n-  Small electric pole (position x=111.5, y=-30.5) that connects the steam engine to the electricity grid\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n### Errors when using connect_entities function\n-  Ensure that the correct number of arguments are passed to the function. The function takes 3 positional arguments.\n-  Ensure that the arguments passed are of the correct type. The function expects entity objects, not positions.\n\n### Errors when setting entity recipe\n-  Ensure that the entity is a building that can have its recipe or filter set.\n-  Ensure that the entity is not out of fuel or ingredients.\n\n### Errors when using float values as integers\n-  Ensure that float values are converted to integers before being used as indices or in other integer contexts.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n*   connect_entities: function that connects two entities with a transport belt. \n    *   Success modes: The entities are connected with a transport belt.\n    *   Failure modes: The function is called with the wrong number of arguments or with arguments of the wrong type.\n*   set_entity_recipe: function that sets the recipe of an entity.\n    *   Success modes: The recipe of the entity is set.\n    *   Failure modes: The entity is not a building that can have its recipe or filter set, or the entity is out of fuel or ingredients.\n*   Important variables:\n    *   drill: BurnerMiningDrill object\n    *   inserter: BurnerInserter object\n    *   furnace: Furnace object\n    *   Prototype.TransportBelt: Prototype object for transport belt\n    *   Prototype.IronPlate: Prototype object for iron plate"}
