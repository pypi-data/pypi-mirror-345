{"content": "Based on the execution logs and entity data, I'll create a comprehensive report:\n\n# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Complex at (-15, -50)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-15, -50) mining iron ore\n- Wooden chest at (-14.5, -48.5) collecting iron ore\n- Stone furnace at (-14, -47) smelting iron plates\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line (0, 0) to (6, 4)\nConsists of four parallel smelting stations:\n- Stone furnace at (0, 0)\n- Stone furnace at (2, 0)\n- Stone furnace at (4, 4)\n- Stone furnace at (6, 4)\nAll furnaces are operational with coal fuel and producing iron plates\n\n### Automation Science Pack Assembly at (24.5, 4.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine-1 at (24.5, 4.5)\n- Input chest at (21.5, 4.5) containing iron plates and copper plates\n- Output chest at (27.5, 4.5) collecting automation science packs\n- Two burner inserters at (22.5, 4.5) and (26.5, 4.5) moving materials\n\n### Power Generation Complex\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, 24.5) providing water\n- Boiler at (-2, 23.5) heating water to steam\n- Steam engine at (9.5, 19.5) generating electricity\n- Complex pipe network connecting water and steam flow\n- Electric pole network distributing power across the facility\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Fuel Management Issues\n- Keep monitoring fuel levels in burner mining drills to prevent \"out of fuel\" status\n- Ensure boiler has constant fuel supply to maintain steam production\n- Maintain coal reserves for multiple furnaces to prevent production interruptions\n\n### Resource Flow Issues\n- Monitor assembling machine ingredient supply - currently showing shortage of iron gear wheels\n- Ensure consistent material supply chains between chests and machines\n\n### Infrastructure Management\n- When reconstructing pipe networks, ensure complete removal of old segments before placing new ones\n- Verify fluid connections are properly established between boiler and steam engine\n- Keep track of coal distribution across multiple consumers (furnaces, mining drills, boiler)\n\n### Inventory Management\n- Maintain adequate coal supplies before attempting to refuel multiple machines\n- Monitor input/output chest contents to prevent production bottlenecks\n- Ensure proper distribution of resources across all production facilities"}
