{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Coal Mining and Collection at Position (52.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (52.0, -82.0) \n- Burner inserter at position (52.5, -79.5) \n- Wooden chest at position (53.5, -80.5) for collecting coal\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Collection at Position (-12.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (-12.0, -51.0)\n- Wooden chest at position (-11.5, -49.5) for collecting iron ore\n- Burner inserter at position (-11.5, -48.5) \n\n### Iron Plate Production at Position (-14.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) (currently lacking ingredients)\n- Burner inserter at position (-13.5, -46.5) \n- Wooden chest at position (-13.5, -45.5) \n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors when placing entities into occupied tiles\n- Ensure there is no existing object in the way before attempting to place a new entity. This will prevent placement errors like those encountered at positions (-12.0, -51.0) and (52.5, -79.5).\n\n### Inserter alignment issues\n- Verify the alignment of inserter pickup positions with the intended source entities. Misalignment can lead to inefficiencies or failures in resource collection and delivery, as seen with the iron ore chest.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - `place_entity`: Attempts to place an entity at a specified position. Failure occurs if the target location is occupied by another object.\n  - `get_entity`: Retrieves an entity at a specified position. Failure occurs if no entity of the specified type is found at the position.\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `iron_ore_chest`: Represents the wooden chest intended to collect iron ore.\n  - `coal_chest`: Represents the wooden chest intended to collect coal.\n  - `iron_ore_drill_position`: Position variable for the iron ore mining drill.\n  - `coal_chest_position`: Position variable for the coal chest."}
