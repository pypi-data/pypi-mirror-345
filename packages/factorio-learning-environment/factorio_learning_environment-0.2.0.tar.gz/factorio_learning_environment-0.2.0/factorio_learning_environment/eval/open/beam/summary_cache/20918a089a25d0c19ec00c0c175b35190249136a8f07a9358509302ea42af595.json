{"content": "I see the core issue now. We cannot craft either wooden or iron chests because:\n1. Wood needs to be gathered from trees (not craftable)\n2. Iron chests need more iron plates and require a specific crafting machine\n\nLet's try a different approach - let's check what entities are already available in the game world:\n\n```python\n# Check our inventory\ninventory = inspect_inspect()\nprint(f\"Current inventory: {inventory}\")\n\n# Let's see what entities are already in the game world\nentities = get_entities()\nprint(f\"Available entities: {entities}\")\n\n# Specifically look for chests that might already exist\nchests = get_entities({Prototype.WoodenChest, Prototype.IronChest})\nprint(f\"Existing chests: {chests}\")\n\n# Get mining drills\ndrills = get_entities({Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill})\nprint(f\"Mining drills: {drills}\")\n\n# This will help us understand what we're working with and plan next steps\n```\n\nThis will give us a better picture of what's already available in the game world, so we can make a more informed decision about how to proceed. Based on what we find, we can then:\n1. Either use existing chests if available\n2. Or find a different storage solution\n3. Or determine what resources/machines we need to gather/craft first\n\nWould you like me to proceed with this analysis?", "summary_range": "[1-2752]"}
