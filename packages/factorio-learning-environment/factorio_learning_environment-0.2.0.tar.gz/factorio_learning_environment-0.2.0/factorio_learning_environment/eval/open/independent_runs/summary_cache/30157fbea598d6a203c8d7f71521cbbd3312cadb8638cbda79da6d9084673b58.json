{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Setup at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and transfers it to the wooden chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates, but currently not receiving ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Alignment and Functionality\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly aligned to transfer items from the chest to the furnace. Repeated repositioning suggests alignment issues.\n- Verify that the inserter is properly fueled and operational to avoid interruptions in item transfer.\n\n### Errors Due to Inventory Shortages\n- Maintain sufficient coal in your inventory to refuel entities like mining drills and inserters. An error occurred due to attempting to insert coal when none was available.\n\n### Errors in Entity Placement\n- When placing entities such as inserters, ensure that there is no collision with existing entities. Adjust spacing or direction to avoid placement errors.\n- Be cautious of placing entities in areas that cannot support them, such as water or occupied tiles.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Ingredients\n- Check the setup to ensure that the furnace is correctly connected and receiving iron ore. The furnace currently reports no ingredients to smelt, indicating a potential issue with the supply chain."}
