{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-46.5, -119.0) with no fuel\n- Steam Engine at Position (-40.5, -113.5) not connected to the power network\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting at Position (-15.0, -76.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-15.0, -76.0) with output blocked\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-19.0, -73.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n\n### Copper Plate Production\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n- Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) not receiving electricity\n- Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (6.5, -59.5) containing iron plates\n\n### Pipe Network\n- PipeGroup at Position (-48.5, -122.5) with water\n- Multiple empty PipeGroups at various positions\n\n### Electricity Network\n- Small Electric Poles at various positions, not supplying power to all connected entities\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities Without Inventory\n- Ensure you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to place an entity. For example, attempting to place a stone furnace without having one in the inventory will result in an error.\n\n### Errors Due to Insufficient Resources for Crafting\n- Verify that you have all required resources before crafting an item. For instance, crafting a stone furnace requires 5 stones, which were insufficient in the inventory.\n\n### Errors with Blocked Outputs\n- Make sure that the output of mining drills or other entities is not blocked. Ensure there is a sink entity or clear path for the output.\n\n### Errors with Unpowered Entities\n- Ensure that all entities requiring electricity are connected to a powered electricity network. Check connections and ensure the electricity generator is functioning and connected to the power grid.\n\n### Errors with No Ingredients in Furnaces\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to process. Check the supply chain to ensure raw materials reach the furnaces."}
