{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll generate a report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n###Coal Mining Setup at Position(41.0, -82.0)\n- Burner mining drill mining coal (position 41.0, -82.0)\n- Wooden chest collecting coal (position 41.5, -80.5)\n- Multiple burner inserters have been placed around position (42.5-43.5, -79.5 to -81.5) to automate coal movement from chest to drill\n\n###Iron Plate Production at Position(-15.0, -50.0)\n- Stone furnace for smelting iron plates (position -15.0, -50.0)\n\nERROR TIPS\n1. Entity Placement Collisions\n- Multiple attempts to place burner inserters failed due to existing objects in the way\n- Before placing entities, verify the target location is clear of other entities\n- Common error positions: (40.5, -82.5), (40.0, -82.0), (41.5, -81.5)\n\n2. Resource Extraction Issues\n- Attempting to extract items from furnaces when they're empty\n- Check furnace contents before attempting extraction\n- Verify the target entity exists and contains the desired items before extraction\n\n3. Entity Positioning\n- Several attempts to place inserters in occupied spaces\n- Ensure proper spacing between entities during placement\n- Consider the size of entities when planning layouts\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nFunctions:\n- place_entity(): Places entities in the game world\n  Success: Returns placed entity\n  Failure: Throws exception when placement location is occupied or invalid\n\n- extract_item(item_type, source, quantity): Extracts items from entities\n  Success: Returns extracted items\n  Failure: Throws exception when source doesn't contain items or quantity unavailable\n\nImportant Variables:\n- furnace: Furnace entity reference\n- inserter: Inserter entity reference\n- drill: Mining drill entity reference\n- chest: Chest entity reference"}
