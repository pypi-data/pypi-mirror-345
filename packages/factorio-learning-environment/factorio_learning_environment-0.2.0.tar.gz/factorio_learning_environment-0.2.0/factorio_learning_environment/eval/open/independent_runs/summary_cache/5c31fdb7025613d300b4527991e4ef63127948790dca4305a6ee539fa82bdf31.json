Regularly check and refill fuel inventories to avoid operational halts.\n\n#### Errors related to item transfer\n- Ensure that inserters have access to source items and that their pickup and drop positions are correctly configured. Verify that source chests are not empty and that destination chests are not full.\n\n#### Errors related to mining operations\n- Ensure that mining drills have sufficient fuel and that the chests at their drop positions are not full. Empty the chests regularly to allow continuous mining.\n\n#### Errors related to smelting operations\n- Ensure that furnaces have both fuel and ingredients to smelt. Regularly check and refill both fuel and ingredient inventories to avoid operational halts.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n#### Utility Functions\n- None defined yet.\n\n#### Important Variables\n- None assigned yet."}
