{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-16.0, y=-49.0) with status FULL_OUTPUT, fueled by coal, producing iron plates.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0) with status WORKING, fueled by coal, producing iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-17.5, y=-47.5), waiting for source items, connected to the stone furnace at (x=-16.0, y=-49.0).\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-47.5), working, connected to the stone furnace at (x=-14.0, y=-49.0).\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-13.5, y=-46.5), storing iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-14.5, y=-45.5), waiting for source items, connected to the wooden chest at (x=-13.5, y=-46.5).\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-45.5), waiting for space in destination, connected to the wooden chest at (x=-13.5, y=-46.5).\n- **BeltGroup** connecting various entities, facilitating the movement of items between furnaces and chests.\n\n### Iron Chest Storage System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Iron Chest** at position (x=-11.5, y=-44.5), storing iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-11.5, y=-45.5), waiting for source items, connected to the iron chest.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-9.5, y=-44.5), waiting for source items, connected to the transport belt system.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Placement\n- Ensure there is enough space and no existing entities at the intended placement position before placing an inserter. Consider adjusting the spacing, direction, or reference position to avoid conflicts with existing entities like iron chests or other inserters.\n\n### Errors with Belt Connections\n- Use inserters to connect belts to chests. Direct connections from belts to chests are not possible and require an inserter to facilitate item transfer.\n\n### Errors with Undefined Entities\n- Ensure all entity types and names are correctly defined and available in the system to avoid errors like \"name 'BurnerType' is not defined\" or \"name 'BurnerInserter' is not defined.\"\n\n### Errors with Blocked Outputs\n- Regularly check for obstructions and ensure there is a sink entity to accept outputs from inserters to prevent blockages.\n\n### Errors with No Free Position\n- Before placing an entity, ensure there is a free position available to avoid errors related to unavailable space for placement.\n\n### Errors with Attribute Access\n- Ensure that all objects and their attributes are correctly defined and accessible to avoid errors like \"'BeltGroup' object has no attribute 'warnings'.\""}
