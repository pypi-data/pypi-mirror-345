{"content": "## Report\n\n### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) refueled and working, dropping iron ore into:\n- **Iron Chest** at position (-16.5, -48.5) containing iron ore.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (-13.0, -48.0), (-11.0, -48.0), and (-9.0, -48.0) with transferred iron ore and producing iron plates.\n- **Iron Chests** at positions (-13.5, -49.5), (-15.5, -48.5), and (-14.5, -47.5) for storage.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5) which is full, causing a warning on the mining drill.\n\n#### Coal Storage and Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (41.0, -82.0) refueled and working, dropping coal into:\n- **Iron Chests** at positions (41.5, -80.5), (42.5, -80.5), (44.5, -80.5), (45.5, -80.5), (47.5, -80.5), and (49.5, -80.5) containing coal and iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserters** at positions (43.5, -80.5) and (41.5, -78.5) transferring coal between chests and furnaces.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (41.5, -79.5) containing coal.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the connected supply chain is intact and that source items are available for the inserter to operate. Check the supply lines and source inventories.\n\n#### Chest Full Warning\n- Regularly check and clear full chests to prevent mining drills from stopping due to lack of space at the drop position. This will ensure continuous operation of mining drills.\n\n#### Furnace No Ingredients Warning\n- Ensure that stone furnaces have a continuous supply of raw materials to process. Regularly transfer necessary ingredients to avoid production halts.\n\n#### Inserter Out of Fuel\n- Keep inserters fueled to maintain their operation. Regularly check fuel levels and refuel as necessary to avoid stoppages."}
