{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Transport Belt group connecting the mining drill to the furnace, with belts at positions (-14.5, -54.5), (-13.5, -54.5), (-12.5, -54.5), and (-15.5, -52.5).\n- Stone Furnace at position (-10.0, -50.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserters at positions (-10.5, -48.5), (-7.5, -49.5), and (-5.5, -49.5) for transferring materials between entities.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-8.5, -49.5) for storing produced items.\n\n### Transport Belt Network\nConsists of multiple belt groups:\n- Belt Group 1: Inputs from position (-21.5, -51.5) to (-19.5, -51.5), outputs from (-18.5, -49.5) to (-16.5, -49.5).\n- Belt Group 2: Inputs from position (-17.5, -50.5) to (-17.5, -52.5), outputs from (-16.5, -55.5) to (-14.5, -55.5).\n- Additional belts connecting various positions for material transport.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Belts Directly to Non-Belt Entities\n- Ensure that belts are not connected directly to non-belt entities like Stone Furnaces or Wooden Chests. Use inserters to facilitate the transfer of items between belts and these entities.\n\n### NameError for Undefined Variables\n- Verify that all variables used in the code are properly defined before usage. For instance, ensure `drill_to_belt_inserter` is correctly initialized before accessing its attributes.\n\n### Inventory Management Errors\n- Ensure that there is sufficient coal in the inventory before attempting to insert it into entities like inserters. Regularly check inventory levels to prevent such errors.\n\n### Inspection of Transport Belt Inventory\n- Confirm that the transport belt is correctly referenced and that its inventory can be accessed. Avoid attempting to inspect or modify a nil value."}
