{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (40.5, -83.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) with a drop position at (40.5, -83.5)\n- Wooden Chests at positions (40.5, -83.5), (41.5, -83.5), and (42.5, -83.5) for storing coal and iron plates\n- Transport Belt connecting from (40.5, -83.5) to (38.5, -83.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n- Burner Inserter at position (1.5, 0.5) transferring items from a wooden chest at (2.5, 0.5) to the furnace\n- Wooden Chest at position (2.5, 0.5) for storing input materials\n\n### Copper Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (10.0, 0.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n- Burner Inserters at positions (6.5, 0.5), (8.5, 0.5), and (11.5, 0.5) waiting for source items\n- Wooden Chests at positions (7.5, 0.5), (10.5, 1.5), and (12.5, 0.5) for storing copper plates and iron plates\n- Transport Belt connecting from (3.5, 0.5) to (5.5, 0.5)\n\n### Coal Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chests at positions (28.5, 0.5), (30.5, 0.5), (32.5, 0.5), (34.5, 0.5), (36.5, 0.5), and (38.5, 0.5) for storing coal\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Removing Chests\n- Ensure that the correct method is used to remove a chest. The 'Chest' object is not callable, indicating a misuse of the API.\n\n### Errors when Setting Up New Storage\n- Verify the presence of the entity type at the specified position before attempting to set up new storage. Ensure that a wooden chest exists at the intended location.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source chest or entity has the necessary items for the inserter to function. Refill the source chest with required items to avoid delays.\n\n### Errors when Managing Inventory\n- Check the inventory capacity before attempting to insert items. Avoid trying to insert more items than the inventory can hold.\n\n### Errors with Empty Source Chests\n- Regularly check and refill source chests to ensure continuous operation of inserters and production lines."}
