{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (61.0, -54.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (61.0, -54.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (61.5, -52.5) for storing coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (62.5, -53.5) for storing coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (62.5, -52.5) for storing coal.\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) for extracting coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (41.5, -83.5) for transferring coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (40.5, -83.5) for storing extracted coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (42.5, -83.5) for storing extracted coal.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entity has items available for the inserter to pick up. This can be resolved by ensuring continuous supply of resources to the source entity.\n\n### Furnace Result is Full\n- Regularly extract items from the furnace to prevent it from becoming full and halting production. Consider setting up an automated system to transfer items from the furnace to storage.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- No utility functions have been defined by the agent in the provided logs.\n- Important variables:\n  - `current_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the current inventory of the agent.\n  - `furnace_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the inventory of the furnace at position (61.0, -54.0)."}
