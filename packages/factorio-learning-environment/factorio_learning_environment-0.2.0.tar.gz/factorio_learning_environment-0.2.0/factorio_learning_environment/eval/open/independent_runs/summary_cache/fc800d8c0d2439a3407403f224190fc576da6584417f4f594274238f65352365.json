{"content": "# Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (5.5, 21.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (5.5, 21.5)\n- Boiler at position (-1.5, 24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and the boiler to the steam engine, with pipe positions including (x=-8.5, y=23.5), (x=-9.5, y=23.5), (x=-6.5, y=23.5), (x=-5.5, y=23.5), (x=-3.5, y=23.5), (x=-3.5, y=24.5), (x=-0.5, y=22.5), (x=-1.5, y=22.5), (x=1.5, y=22.5), (x=3.5, y=24.5), (x=5.5, y=24.5), (x=4.5, y=24.5)\n- Electricity network with poles at positions (x=1.5, y=14.5), (x=3.5, y=20.5), (x=1.5, y=6.5), (x=1.5, y=10.5), (x=1.5, y=2.5)\n\n### Lab at Position (2.5, 0.5)\n- Connected to the power network and currently conducting Automation research.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Lab\n- Ensure that the lab entity is correctly defined and instantiated before attempting to access or modify it. Use the correct class name and ensure the lab is placed on the map before interacting with it.\n\n### Errors in Pipe Connection\n- Verify that all required pipe items are available in the inventory before attempting to connect pipes.\n- Ensure that the pipes are correctly aligned and connected between the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine. Double-check the positions and ensure there are no gaps in the pipe network.\n\n### Errors in Fuel Management\n- Regularly check coal inventory levels to ensure there is enough fuel for the boiler. Harvest more coal if necessary to maintain a steady supply.\n\n### Errors in Steam Engine Operation\n- Confirm that the steam engine is properly connected to the boiler and receiving steam. If the steam engine is not working, check the pipe connections and ensure the boiler is fueled and operational.\n\n### General Error Handling\n- Address any assertion errors by verifying the conditions being checked. For example, ensure that the steam engine is indeed working before asserting its status.\n- Review and correct any NameErrors by ensuring that all entities and variables are correctly named and defined in the code."}
