{"content": "Based on the execution logs, here is the updated report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining Setup at (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0) mining coal\n- Wooden chest at (41.5, -80.5) collecting mined coal\n- Stone furnace at (43.0, -80.0) positioned nearby but not properly connected\n\nThe setup is partially functional with the mining drill successfully extracting coal into the chest, but attempts to add an inserter and properly position the furnace have failed.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Conflicts\n- Before placing entities, check if the target location is clear of other entities and placeable terrain\n- When repositioning entities, ensure removal of all blocking entities in the target area first\n- Pay attention to entity dimensions - larger entities like furnaces (2x2) need more clear space than smaller ones (1x1)\n\n### Structure Positioning Issues\n- Plan the complete layout before placing entities to avoid frequent repositioning\n- Consider the working directions and connection points of entities when placing them\n- Leave adequate space between entities to allow for inserters and belts\n\n### Resource Management\n- Monitor chest capacity - the mining drill stops when output chest is full\n- Consider adding overflow prevention or chest emptying logic\n- Maintain proper fuel levels in burner entities\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nFunctions:\n- place_entity(): Places entities on the map\n  Success: When target location is clear and valid\n  Failure: When location is blocked or terrain is unplaceable\n\nImportant Variables:\n- furnace: EntityReference (stone-furnace)\n- inserter: EntityReference (burner-inserter)\n- mining_drill: EntityReference (burner-mining-drill)\n- chest: EntityReference (wooden-chest)"}
