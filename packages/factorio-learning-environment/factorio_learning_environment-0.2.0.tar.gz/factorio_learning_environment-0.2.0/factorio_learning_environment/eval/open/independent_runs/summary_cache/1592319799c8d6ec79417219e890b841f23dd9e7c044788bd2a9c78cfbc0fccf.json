{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-68.5, -95.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-68.5, -95.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-46.5, -122.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (-59.5, -111.5)\n- Several PipeGroups connecting these components, currently not successfully connected.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-15.0, -76.0) connected to an Iron Chest at Position (-15.5, -77.5)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-19.0, -73.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n- Stone Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n- Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) not receiving electricity\n\n### Storage Facilities\n- Iron Chest at Position (-15.5, -77.5) containing Iron Ore\n- Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5) containing Iron Plates\n- Wooden Chest at Position (6.5, -59.5) containing Iron Ore, Iron Plates, and Copper Plates\n\n### Research Facility\n- Lab with input of Automation Science Pack, connected to the power network but no research in progress\n\n### Pipe Networks\nSeveral PipeGroups exist, but they are currently empty and not successfully connected to the intended structures.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure all pipe connections are properly aligned and connected between the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine. Verify the positions and connectivity of pipes to avoid disconnection errors.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Resources\n- Ensure you have enough resources in your inventory before attempting to craft items like Automation Science Packs.\n\n### Errors in Inserting Items\n- Verify that the items you intend to insert into entities like labs are available in your inventory to avoid insertion errors.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Power\n- Ensure that all electrical entities, such as inserters, are connected to a power source to function correctly. Check the power network connections and ensure they are complete."}
