{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position 0.0, 0.0) which is currently not smelting due to lack of ingredients.\n\n### Wooden chests\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest (position 2.5, 0.5) which is empty.\n- Wooden chest (position 3.5, 0.5) which contains 19 iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when attempting to craft items without sufficient materials\n- Ensure you have enough materials in your inventory before attempting to craft items. For example, crafting Assembling Machines failed due to insufficient iron plates and electronic circuits.\n\n### Errors when trying to craft items without unlocking the recipe\n- Research the required technology before attempting to craft items that depend on it. The Assembling Machine recipe requires Automation technology, which must be researched first.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `craft_item(item_type, quantity)`: This function has failed when attempting to craft iron plates and assembling machines due to insufficient materials and unlocked recipes respectively.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `iron_ore_available`: int\n- `crafted_quantity_plate`: int\n- `crafted_quantity_assembler`: int\n- `current_inventory`: dict\n- `final_inventory`: dict"}
