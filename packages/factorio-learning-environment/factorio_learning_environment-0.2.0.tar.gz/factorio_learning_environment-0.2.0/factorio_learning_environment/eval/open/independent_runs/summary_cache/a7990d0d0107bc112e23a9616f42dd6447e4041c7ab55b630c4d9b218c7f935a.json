{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n---------------------\nNo new structures have been successfully placed on the map. All attempts to create or place a Lab at (0.5, 2.5) have failed due to inventory shortages and crafting dependency issues. Although existing furnaces were identified and used for smelting operations (an alternative furnace at Position(x=5.0, y=5.0) and a copper furnace at Position(x=-27.0, y=-60.0)), these entities were not newly constructed by the agent.\n\nERROR TIPS\n----------\n\u2022 Incorrect API usage for entity retrieval:\n  - When calling get_entities, avoid unsupported keyword arguments (e.g., passing 'radius') or excessive positional arguments. Refer to the API specification to use the proper call signature.\n  \n\u2022 Lab placement and crafting issues:\n  - Before attempting to place a Lab, verify that the Lab item is present in the inventory. \n  - When crafting a Lab, ensure all intermediate components (such as iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, and copper-cables) can be produced or are available; verify that the resource conversion chain is complete.\n  \n\u2022 Handling unexpected None values:\n  - When processing retrieved entities (for example, filtering labs), confirm that the result is iterable (fallback to an empty list if None) to prevent errors during iteration.\n\n\u2022 Inventory and resource management:\n  - Consistently monitor resource levels and validate that sufficient raw materials and intermediates are available before initiating smelting or crafting processes."}
