{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 19.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (-5.5, 19.5)\n- Boiler at position (-2.5, 24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe Group connecting from position (-5.5, 16.5) to (-8.5, 23.5)\n- Electricity Group at position (-5.4, 20.0)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Fuel Management\n- Ensure that the boiler has a consistent supply of fuel (coal) to maintain operation. Check inventory before attempting to insert fuel to avoid failures due to insufficient resources.\n\n### Errors in Electricity Network Connection\n- Connect the steam engine to an electricity network to ensure it is operational. Use small electric poles to connect the electricity group to the network.\n\n### Errors in List Indexing\n- When creating paths or accessing lists, ensure that the indices are within the valid range to avoid \"IndexError: list index out of range\".\n\n### Errors when Placing into a Tile Which is Occupied by Another Entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it. Check if the tile is occupied to avoid placement errors.\n\n### Errors with No Existing Electricity Group\n- Verify that an electricity group exists before attempting to connect to it. If none exists, create one using available resources like small electric poles."}
