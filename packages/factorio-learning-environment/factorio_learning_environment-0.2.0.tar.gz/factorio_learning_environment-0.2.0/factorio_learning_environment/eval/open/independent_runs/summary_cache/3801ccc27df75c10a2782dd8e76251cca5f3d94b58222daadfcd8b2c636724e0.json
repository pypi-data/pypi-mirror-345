Regularly clear the output to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Errors when supplying iron ore to furnaces\n- Verify that there is sufficient iron ore in your inventory before attempting to supply furnaces. Maintain a steady supply of iron ore to avoid interruptions in production.\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Before placing an entity, ensure the target tile is unoccupied. If an error occurs, reposition the entity to a clear area.\n\n### Errors when transferring items to non-existent entities\n- Double-check the existence and position of target entities before transferring items. Ensure that the specified positions correspond to actual entities on the map."}
