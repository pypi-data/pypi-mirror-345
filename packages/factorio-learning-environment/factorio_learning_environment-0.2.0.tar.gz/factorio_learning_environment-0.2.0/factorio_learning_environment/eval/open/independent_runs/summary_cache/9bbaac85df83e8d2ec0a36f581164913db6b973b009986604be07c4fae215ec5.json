1).\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 Candidate and Buildable Validation Errors:\n\u2003\u2013 Expanded grid search did not yield a buildable candidate for the Offshore Pump.\n\u2003\u2013 Manual re-placement using historical coordinates resulted in unbuildable candidate positions for both the Offshore Pump (at x=-7.5, y=25.5) and the Boiler (at x=-5.5, y=24.0).\n\u2003\u2013 In the remote region, initial candidate searches around the water patch failed to secure a valid placement until a nearest_buildable search was applied.\n\u2003\u2003(Ensure candidate positions are validated with proper clearance checks and revalidate positions after inventory or relocation actions.)\n\n\u2022 Incorrect Use of Position Objects:\n\u2003\u2013 A TypeError (\u201c'Position' object is not callable\u201d) occurred during the retrieval of nearest buildable candidates.\n\u2003\u2003(Avoid invoking Position objects as functions; use proper attribute access or designated methods.)\n\n\u2022 Pipe Connection and Resource Shortage:\n\u2003\u2013 Pipe connection attempts between the Offshore Pump and Boiler failed because insufficient pipe items were available (Required: 8, Available: 1).\n\u2003\u2003(Pre-calculate material requirements and verify inventory levels before attempting pipe connections.)\n\n\u2022 Crafting and Sub-Ingredient Shortages:\n\u2003\u2013 Crafting additional pipes failed due to an inability to produce required sub-ingredients (iron-plate), as the recipe needs a working furnace or crafting machine.\n\u2003\u2003(Confirm the availability of all required ingredients and ensure that necessary production facilities are active before initiating crafting.)\n\n\u2022 Inventory Management Issues:\n\u2003\u2013 Insertion of wood into the Stone Furnace failed because the furnace\u2019s inventory was full.\n\u2003\u2003(Monitor inventory capacity and manage storage allocations to prevent overflow errors.)"}
