{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=5.5, y=21.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=5.5, y=21.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=-1.5, y=24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\n- Connected via a series of pipes and small electric poles\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with a warning of no ingredients to smelt\n- The furnace is used for smelting copper ore into copper plates\n\n### Research Lab\nConsists of:\n- Lab at position (x=2.5, y=0.5) currently conducting Automation research\n- Connected to the electricity network via small electric poles\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Insufficient Resources for Crafting\n- Ensure you have enough resources before attempting to craft items. For example, copper plates and wood are needed for crafting copper cables and small electric poles.\n\n### Connection Errors\n- Verify that you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to connect entities, such as pipes or electric poles.\n- Ensure that the entities you are trying to connect are correctly positioned and accessible.\n\n### Entity Not Found Errors\n- Double-check the position and existence of entities like labs before attempting operations.\n- Ensure that the entities are correctly named and defined in your code to avoid NameError exceptions.\n\n### Fuel Management\n- Regularly check and maintain sufficient coal in your inventory to refuel boilers and keep the steam engine operational.\n\n### Assertion Errors\n- Ensure that all components of your power generation system are correctly connected and operational to avoid assertion errors related to the steam engine's status."}
