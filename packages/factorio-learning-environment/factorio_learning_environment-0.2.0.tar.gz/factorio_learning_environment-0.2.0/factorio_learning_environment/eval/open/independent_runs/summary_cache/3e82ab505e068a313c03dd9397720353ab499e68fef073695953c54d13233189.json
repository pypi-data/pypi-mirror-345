{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining Setup at Position (52.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (52.0, -82.0) with a drop position at (52.5, -80.5), currently operational and mining coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -79.5) intended to collect coal from the Burner Mining Drill.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Setup at Position (-12.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-12.0, -51.0) with a drop position at (-11.5, -49.5), currently operational and mining iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) used for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities without having them in inventory\n- Ensure that the required entity is crafted and available in the inventory before attempting to place it. For example, attempts to place Burner Mining Drills and Stone Furnaces failed due to lack of inventory.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient crafting resources\n- Check the inventory for all necessary resources before crafting. The agent faced crafting issues due to missing iron plates, iron gear wheels, and stone furnaces.\n\n### Errors when inserting items not present in inventory\n- Verify that the items to be inserted are available in the inventory. The agent attempted to insert coal into entities without having coal in the inventory.\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Ensure the target tile is unoccupied before placing a new entity. The agent encountered an error while trying to place a Wooden Chest next to an existing one.\n\n### Errors when trying to access non-existent entities\n- Confirm the existence of an entity at a specified position before attempting to access it. The agent attempted to get a Wooden Chest at a position where none existed.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `place_entity`: Used to place entities on the map.
