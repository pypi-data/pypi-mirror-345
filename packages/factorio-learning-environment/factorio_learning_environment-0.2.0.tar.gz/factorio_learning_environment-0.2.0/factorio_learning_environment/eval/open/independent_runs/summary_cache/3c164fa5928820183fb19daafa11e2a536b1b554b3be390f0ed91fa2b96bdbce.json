{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, y=-60.0) with a drop position at (4.5, y=-58.5) connected to:\n  - **Wooden Chest** at position (4.5, y=-58.5) storing iron ore.\n- **Stone Furnaces** for smelting iron ore into iron plates:\n  - Furnace at position (-15.0, y=-48.0) fueled by coal.\n  - Furnace at position (-13.0, y=-48.0) fueled by coal.\n  - Furnace at position (-11.0, y=-48.0) fueled by coal.\n- **Iron Chest** at position (-5.5, y=-50.5) storing iron ore and iron plates.\n\n### Storage Area\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Multiple **Wooden Chests** at various positions storing iron plates and other resources:\n  - Chests at positions (-11.5, y=-50.5), (-10.5, y=-50.5), (-9.5, y=-50.5), and (-8.5, y=-50.5) are full of iron plates.\n  - Chest at position (-7.5, y=-50.5) contains iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items with insufficient inventory\n- Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. This will prevent errors related to insufficient items for insertion.\n\n### Errors with full chests\n- Regularly check and manage the inventory of chests to prevent them from becoming full. This will ensure continuous operation of mining drills and furnaces without interruption.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - `insert_item`: Attempts to insert a specified quantity of an item into a target entity. Ensure the item is available in the inventory before calling this function.\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `furnace`: Represents a furnace entity where items are inserted.\n  - `coal_to_insert`: Represents the quantity of coal intended for insertion into a furnace."}
