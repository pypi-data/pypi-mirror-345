{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, -60.0) with a drop position at (4.5, -58.5). This drill is connected to a series of wooden chests for ore collection.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (5.5, -60.5), (4.5, -58.5), (4.5, -56.5) for storing mined iron ore.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (-15.0, -48.0), (-13.0, -48.0), and (-11.0, -48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates. These are refueled with coal.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-16.5, -54.5), (-15.5, -54.5), (-14.5, -54.5), and (-13.5, -54.5) for storing iron plates.\n- **Iron Chest** at position (-3.5, -52.5) for additional iron plate storage.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Upgrading Storage Chests\n- Ensure that when upgrading storage chests, the first argument is an Entity object and the second argument is None.\n- Verify that the inventory contains the required items (e.g., iron chests) before attempting to upgrade storage chests.\n\n### Errors in Refueling and Resource Management\n- Ensure sufficient coal is available in the inventory before attempting to refuel burner mining drills or stone furnaces.\n- Regularly check inventory capacity to avoid errors related to full inventory when harvesting resources.\n\n### Errors in Resource Transfer\n- Confirm that the inventory contains the necessary resources before attempting to transfer them to storage chests.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- **harvest_resource(coal_position: Position, quantity: int) -> None**: Harvests a specified quantity of resources from a given position. Ensure inventory space is available before harvesting.\n\n### Important Variables\n- **coal_position: Position**: Represents the position of coal resources on the map.\n- **iron_ore: int**: Represents the quantity of iron ore in the inventory.\n- **iron_plate: int**: Represents the quantity of iron plates in the inventory.\n- **wooden_chest: int**: Represents the number of wooden chests in the inventory."}
