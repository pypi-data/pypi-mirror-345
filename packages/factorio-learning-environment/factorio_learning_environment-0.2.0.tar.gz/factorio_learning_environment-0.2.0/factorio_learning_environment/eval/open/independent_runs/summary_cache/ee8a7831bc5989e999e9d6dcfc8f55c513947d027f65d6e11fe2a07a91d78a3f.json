{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Wooden Chest at position(41.5, -80.5)\nConsists of:\n- Wooden Chest (position 41.5, -80.5) with an inventory containing coal.\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position(41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position 41.0, -82.0) currently mining coal with an inventory containing coal.\n\n### Stone Furnace at position(-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace (position -15.0, -50.0) which is currently not smelting due to lack of ingredients.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n- **Errors when the Wooden Chest is full**\n  - Ensure to empty the Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -80.5) before attempting to extract more coal. The chest being full prevents further mining operations.\n\n- **Errors when the Burner Mining Drill is not collecting coal**\n  - Check the inventory of the Burner Mining Drill and ensure it has enough fuel. If it is not collecting coal, it may be due to insufficient fuel or the mining area being depleted.\n\n- **Errors when attempting to smelt without ingredients**\n  - Ensure that the Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -50.0) has the necessary ingredients to smelt. Currently, it has no ingredients to process.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions Defined:**\n  - None noted in the execution logs.\n\n- **Important Variables Assigned:**\n  - `coal`: int\n  - `wood`: int\n  - `iron-plate`: int\n  - `Burner Mining Drill`: object\n  - `Wooden Chest`: object\n  - `Stone Furnace`: object"}
