{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n- Iron Furnace at an unspecified position, receiving iron ore and coal for smelting\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0) connected to a Stone Furnace at position (x=41.0, y=-80.0)\n- Copper Furnace at position (x=-20.0, y=-71.0), currently out of fuel and lacking ingredients to smelt\n\n### Storage Facility\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=43.5, y=-79.5) for storing items\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Insufficient Inventory\n- Ensure that you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into structures. For example, the error at step 488 and step 491 occurred because there was no coal available in the inventory to insert into the drills or furnaces.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `insert_item`: Used for inserting items into entities. Ensure that the inventory has the required items before calling this function to avoid errors.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `iron_drill`: Represents the iron mining drill entity.\n- `iron_furnace`: Represents the iron furnace entity.\n- `copper_furnace`: Represents the copper furnace entity.\n- `current_inventory`: Dictionary representing the current state of the player's inventory."}
