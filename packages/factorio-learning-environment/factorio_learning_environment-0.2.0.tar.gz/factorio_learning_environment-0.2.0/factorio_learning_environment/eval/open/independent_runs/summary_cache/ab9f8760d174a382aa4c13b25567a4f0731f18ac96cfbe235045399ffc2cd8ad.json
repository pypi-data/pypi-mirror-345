{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-11.5, 18.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position -11.5, 18.5), boiler (position -11.5, 25.0), and offshore pump (position -9.5, 24.5). The steam engine is currently not connected to the power network and has no input liquid. The boiler also has no input liquid and is not connected.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 0, 0) and a furnace (position 0, 0)\n- Burner mining drill (position 5, 5) and a furnace (position 5, 5)\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine (position z1) and inserter (position a) that puts into the assembling machine\n- Beltgroup (position) that connects the furnace at position y1 to the assembling machine at position z1\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting pipes\n- Ensure that the positions of the entities you are trying to connect are valid and within range. Check that there are no obstacles or misplaced entities in between the connection points.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it. Check for any existing entities that may block the placement."}
