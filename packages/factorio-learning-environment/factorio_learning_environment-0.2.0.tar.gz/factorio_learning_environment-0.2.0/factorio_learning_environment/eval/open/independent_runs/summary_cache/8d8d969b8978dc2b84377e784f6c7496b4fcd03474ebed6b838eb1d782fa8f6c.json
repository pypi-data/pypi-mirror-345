{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Steam Engine** at position (x=17.5, y=20.5), generating power.\n- **Boiler** at position (x=1.5, y=23.0), currently out of fuel.\n- **Offshore Pump** at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5), working and supplying water.\n- **Pipe Group** connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine, with various pipes at positions such as (x=3.5, y=17.5), (x=-8.5, y=23.5), etc.\n- **Electricity Group** with poles at positions like (x=1.5, y=10.5), (x=1.5, y=2.5), (x=10.5, y=13.5), etc., providing electrical connections.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Boiler Out of Fuel\n- Regularly check and refuel the boiler to ensure continuous operation of the electricity generator.\n\n### Steam Engine Not Connected\n- Ensure that all necessary connections for the steam engine are established, particularly fluid connections, to avoid warnings like 'no input liquid' or 'no fluid present in connections'."}
