{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Smelting System (around x=45, y=-80)\nComplex smelting setup consisting of:\n- Input chest at (45.5, -79.5) containing iron ore\n- Two stone furnaces at (45.0, -81.0) and (47.0, -81.0)\n- Two burner inserters:\n  - At (47.5, -79.5) oriented to pick from (48.5, -79.5) and drop at (46.5, -79.5)\n  - At (48.5, -80.5) oriented to pick from (47.5, -80.5) and drop at (49.5, -80.5)\n- Output chest at (49.5, -80.5) containing iron plates\n- Both furnaces have coal fuel (49-50 units each)\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage System (around x=41, y=-82)\nAutomated coal mining setup consisting of:\n- Burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0) mining coal\n- Multiple storage chests:\n  - Two iron chests at (41.5, -84.5) and (41.5, -83.5) both full with 1600 coal each\n  - Wooden chest at (41.5, -80.5) containing 800 coal\n- Empty wooden chest at (45.5, -84.5)\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Errors\n- Check for existing entities before attempting to place new ones at a location\n- Error messages indicate attempts to place burner-inserters where other entities already exist\n\n### Entity Access Errors\n- Verify entity existence before trying to access or modify it\n- Getting entity errors occurred when trying to access non-existent burner inserters\n\n### Resource Management Issues\n- Mining drill shows \"out of fuel\" warning - ensure continuous fuel supply\n- Full chests blocking mining operations - implement chest emptying routine\n- Furnaces showing \"no ingredients to smelt\" - ensure proper material flow\n\n### Inserter Configuration Issues\n- Multiple attempts to reorient inserters suggest issues with pickup/drop position calculations\n- Ensure inserter orientations are correctly set for the intended material flow\n\n# NAMESPACE\n\n### Important Variables\n- `first_inserter`: BurnerInserter\n- `second_inserter`: BurnerInserter\n\n### System States\n- Coal mining system: Partially blocked due to full storage\n- Iron smelting system: Operational but idle due to input/output flow issues\n- Storage system: Multiple chests at capacity"}
