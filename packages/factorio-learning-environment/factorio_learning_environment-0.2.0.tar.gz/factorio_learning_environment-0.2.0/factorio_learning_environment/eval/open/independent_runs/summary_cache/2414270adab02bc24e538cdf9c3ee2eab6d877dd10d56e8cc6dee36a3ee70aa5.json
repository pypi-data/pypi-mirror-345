{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-11.5, 18.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position -11.5, 18.5), boiler (position -11.5, 25.0), and offshore pump (position -9.5, 24.5). The steam engine is intended to generate electricity, while the boiler heats water supplied by the offshore pump.\n\n### Pipe network\nConsists of multiple pipes connecting the boiler and offshore pump. The pipes are positioned at:\n- Pipe at position (-12.5, 15.5)\n- Pipe at position (-13.5, 15.5)\n- Pipe at position (-10.5, 15.5)\n- Pipe at position (-11.5, 15.5)\n- Pipe at position (-9.5, 15.5)\n- Pipe at position (-13.5, 16.5)\n- Pipe at position (-9.5, 16.5)\n- Pipe at position (-13.5, 20.5)\n- Pipe at position (-13.5, 21.5)\n\n### Copper plate factory at position(0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace (position 0.0, 0.0)\n- Furnace (position 5.0, 5.0)\n\n### Lab at position(1, 3)\nConsists of a lab (position 1.0, 3.0) for research activities.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors connecting boiler to offshore pump\n- Ensure that the positions of the boiler and offshore pump are correctly aligned for the connection. The current connection attempt failed due to incorrect positioning.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
