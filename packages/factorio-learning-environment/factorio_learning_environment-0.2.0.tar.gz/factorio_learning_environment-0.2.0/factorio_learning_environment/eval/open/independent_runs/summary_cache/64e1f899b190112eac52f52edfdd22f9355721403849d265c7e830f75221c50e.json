{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Offshore pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore pump (position -9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe (position -10.5, 23.5)\n- Pipe (position -9.5, 23.5)\n- Small electric pole (position -8.5, 23.5)\n\n### Pipe groups\nConsists of the following entities:\n- PipeGroup (fluid_system=9396, position=-16.5, 23.5)\n- PipeGroup (fluid_system=9400, position=-20.5, 29.5)\n- PipeGroup (fluid_system=9399, position=-21.5, 28.5)\n\n### Stone furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position 0.0, 0.0)\n\n### Stone furnace at position (5.0, 5.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position 5.0, 5.0)\n\n### Lab at position (unknown)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab (position unknown)\n\n### Electricity group at position (1.7, -14.1)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Electricity group (id=48684, position 1.7, -14.1)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when trying to get or place entities\n- Ensure the entity you are trying to get or place is at the correct position and not obstructed by other entities. For example, the steam engine could not be placed at (3.0, -19.0) because something was in the way.\n\n### Errors when using electricity groups\n- Check the status of electricity groups and ensure they are properly connected to the electric network. The electricity group found at position (1.7, -14.1) is not plugged into the electric network.\n\n### Errors when entities are missing\n- If a required entity is not found nearby, ensure to check the inventory for available entities before attempting to place new ones. In this case, no steam engine was found nearby, prompting the need to place a new one. \n\n### General placement errors\n- Always verify that the target location is clear before attempting to place any entity to avoid placement errors."}
