Check the inventory of each furnace to confirm the required materials.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it. Check the surrounding area for existing entities.\n\n### Errors related to power supply\n- Ensure that your lab is connected to a power source. Check the connections and the status of the electricity group to confirm power availability."}
