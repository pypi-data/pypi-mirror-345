{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-46.5, -119.0)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-46.5, -119.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (-40.5, -113.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting the offshore pump and boiler, and another PipeGroup connecting the boiler and steam engine\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-15.0, -76.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at Position (-15.5, -77.5)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0) and another at Position (6.0, -62.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n\n### Research Facility\nConsists of:\n- Lab at Position (not specified) with automation-science-pack input and logistics research in progress\n\n### Storage and Transport System\nConsists of:\n- Multiple Wooden Chests for storage at various positions such as (7.5, -61.5) and (6.5, -59.5)\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) for item transport\n\n### Pipe and Electricity Network\nConsists of:\n- Multiple PipeGroups for fluid transport, including water and steam systems\n- ElectricityGroup with small electric poles at various positions to provide power\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Insufficient Inventory\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities. For example, ensure coal is available before trying to insert it into a boiler.\n\n### Errors Related to Fuel and Ingredients\n- Regularly check and refuel entities like Burner Mining Drills and Furnaces to prevent them from running out of fuel.\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt to avoid production halts.\n\n### Errors with Full Output Inventory\n- Regularly empty output chests to prevent mining drills from stopping due to full inventories. For instance, empty the chest at Position (-15.5, -77.5) to continue mining.\n\n### General Placement and Connection Errors\n- Verify that all entities are correctly placed and connected to the necessary resources and power networks to ensure smooth operation."}
