Ensure all required components are available before initiating a craft.\n\n\u2022 Entity Placement and Collision Issues  \n\u2003\u2013 Placement failures can occur when attempting to place Small Electric Poles in occupied zones, as seen by the collision at (4.5, 6.5) near the Assembling Machine. Verify that target tiles are clear and adjust spacing or direction accordingly.\n\n\u2022 Power Network Connection Errors  \n\u2003\u2013 Insufficient Small Electric Pole inventory has led to failures in connecting the Assembling Machine to the intermediate pole. Verify that the inventory meets the connection requirements before establishing power chains.  \n\u2003\u2013 Multiple chain connection attempts\u2014including direct links from the Steam Engine to the intermediate network\u2014have failed, with the Steam Engine producing no power. Confirm that the Steam Engine is receiving adequate fuel and fluid to generate energy.  \n\u2003\u2013 The persistent NO_POWER status of the Assembling Machine suggests the overall network lacks continuity; re-evaluate pole placements and chain connectivity.\n\n\u2022 Function and Type Usage Errors  \n\u2003\u2013 A NameError (e.g., 'local_pole' is not defined) occurred due to improper variable initialization. Ensure that all variables are correctly defined and referenced.  \n\u2003\u2013 Avoid invoking object properties as functions (such as misusing Position.center) to prevent type-related errors.\n\n\u2022 Fluid Connection Failures  \n\u2003\u2013 Failed attempts to connect the Offshore Pump to the Boiler indicate that connection points may be blocked or misaligned. Verify that both source and target connection points are unobstructed and properly configured for fluid transfer.\n\n\u2022 Offshore Pump and Electronic Component Crafting Failures  \n\u2003\u2013 Ensure that all sub-ingredients and raw resources are available when crafting Offshore Pumps and other electronic components to avoid crafting interruptions.\n\n\u2022 Repositioning and Buildable Area Computation Errors  \n\u2003\u2013 Inaccuracies in calculating buildable areas can lead to out-of-range placement or collision errors. Confirm that computed areas fall within allowable distances before placing entities.\n\n\u2022 Resource Insertion and Availability Issues  \n\u2003\u2013 Verify that required entities are present in the inventory prior to placement; replenish stocks as needed to maintain continuous operations.\n\n\u2022 Fuel and Resource Insertion Issues  \n\u2003\u2013 Maintain close monitoring of critical inputs such as boiler fuel and raw materials. Replenish these resources promptly to support production and power generation.\n\n\u2022 Component Extraction Failures  \n\u2003\u2013 Before attempting extraction operations, ensure that production cycles are complete and that valid outputs are available to prevent extraction errors.\n\n\u2022 Removal Operation and Relocation Computation Errors  \n\u2003\u2013 Confirm entity existence and proper data type handling during removal or position computation operations to avoid type-related failures."}
