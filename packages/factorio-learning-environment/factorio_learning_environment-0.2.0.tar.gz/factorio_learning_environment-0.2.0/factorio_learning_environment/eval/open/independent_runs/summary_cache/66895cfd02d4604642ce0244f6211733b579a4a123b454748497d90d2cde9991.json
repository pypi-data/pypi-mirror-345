{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 19.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (-5.5, 19.5)\n- Boiler at position (-2.5, 24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe Group connecting various components at positions (-5.5, 16.5) and (-8.5, 23.5)\n- Multiple Small Electric Poles at positions (-8.5, 17.5), (-8.5, 16.5), (-6.5, 16.5), (-1.5, 16.5), (0.5, 16.5), (0.5, 21.5), (0.5, 24.5), and (-5.5, 25.5)\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors when crafting due to insufficient materials\n- Ensure that you have all the necessary materials in your inventory before attempting to craft an item.\n\n### Errors when placing entities over water\n- Avoid placing entities on water tiles. Check the terrain before placing to ensure the entity footprint does not overlap with water.\n\n### Errors due to unconnected electric networks\n- Make sure all components that require electricity are connected to the electric network. Check connections between poles and ensure they are properly linked to the power source.\n\n### Errors due to lack of fuel\n- Ensure that boilers and other fuel-dependent entities have the necessary fuel to operate. Keep track of fuel levels and replenish them as needed."}
