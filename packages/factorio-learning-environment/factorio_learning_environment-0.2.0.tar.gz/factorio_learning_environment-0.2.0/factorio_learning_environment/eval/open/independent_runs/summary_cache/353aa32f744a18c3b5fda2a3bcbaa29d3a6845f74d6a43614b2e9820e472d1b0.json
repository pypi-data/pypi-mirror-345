{"content": "# Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (41.5, -80.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (43.0, -82.0)\n- Multiple Iron Chests for coal storage at positions (41.5, -80.5), (42.5, -80.5), (44.5, -80.5), (45.5, -80.5), (47.5, -80.5), and (49.5, -80.5)\n- Burner Inserters at positions (43.5, -80.5) and (41.5, -78.5) for transferring coal and iron plates\n- Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -79.5) for additional coal storage\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0)\n- Stone Furnaces at positions (-13.0, -48.0), (-11.0, -48.0), and (-9.0, -48.0)\n- Iron Chests for iron ore and iron plate storage at positions (-18.5, -48.5), (-16.5, -48.5), (-15.5, -48.5), (-13.5, -49.5), and (-14.5, -47.5)\n- Wooden Chests at positions (-12.5, -49.5) and (-9.5, -49.5) for additional storage\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Extracting from Furnaces\n- Ensure that the furnace contains the items you intend to extract. Check the furnace's inventory before attempting to extract.\n\n### Errors when Clearing Drop Chests\n- Verify that the chest contains the expected items before attempting to clear it. Ensure that the chest entity is valid and not empty.\n\n### Errors when Refueling\n- Check the fuel status of drills and furnaces before attempting to refuel. Avoid refueling entities that already have sufficient fuel.\n\n### Errors when Managing Resources\n- Confirm the presence of the target resource in the chest before attempting to manage or extract resources. Ensure the chest is correctly identified and contains the necessary resources.\n\n### Errors when Transferring Items to Storage\n- Ensure that the storage entity is not full and can accommodate the items being transferred. Regularly monitor storage capacity to prevent overflow."}
