{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -80.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest (position 41.5, -80.5) with an inventory containing coal (156 units).\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 41.0, -82.0) with a fuel inventory (currently empty) and a drop position at (41.5, -80.5). It is currently working but has a warning indicating that the chest at the drop position is full.\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position -15.0, -50.0) with a fuel inventory containing coal (50 units) and a result inventory containing iron plates (100 units). It has warnings indicating no ingredients to smelt, that the furnace fuel source is full, and that the furnace result is full.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n- **Errors when extracting coal from the wooden chest**\n  - Ensure that the quantity being extracted does not exceed the available amount in the wooden chest. In multiple instances, attempts to extract 5 units resulted in failure due to insufficient quantity.\n  \n- **Errors when inserting coal into the wooden chest**\n  - Ensure that the wooden chest has enough capacity to accept the inserted coal. If the chest is full, the insertion will fail.\n\n- **Errors when the burner mining drill cannot drop items**\n  - The burner mining drill cannot drop items into the wooden chest if the chest is full. Empty the wooden chest at (41.5, -80.5) to allow the mining drill to continue working.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions Defined:**\n  - `extract_item`: Used to extract items from entities. Failure occurs when trying to extract more items than available.\n  - `insert_item`: Used to insert items into entities. Failure occurs when the target entity is full.\n\n- **Important Variables Assigned:**\n  - `extracted_count`: int - Represents the count of items extracted from an entity.\n  - `current_inventory`: dict - Represents the current inventory of the agent.\n  - `entities_on_map`: list - Represents the current entities present on the map."}
