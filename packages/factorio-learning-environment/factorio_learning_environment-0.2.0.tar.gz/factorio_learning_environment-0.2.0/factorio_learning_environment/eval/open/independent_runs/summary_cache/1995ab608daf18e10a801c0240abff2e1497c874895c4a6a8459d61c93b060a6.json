For example, the inserter at (12.5, -59.5) had a full inventory, causing insertion failures.\n\n#### Errors when extracting from empty furnaces\n- Verify that the furnace contains the required items (e.g., iron plates) before attempting extraction. For example, the furnace at (4.0, -60.0) was empty when extraction was attempted.\n\n#### Errors when placing entities without sufficient inventory\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to place entities. For example, the agent tried to place a wooden chest without having one in inventory.\n\n#### Errors when connecting belts directly to chests\n- Use inserters to transfer items from chests to belts instead of connecting belts directly. For example, the agent attempted to connect a belt directly to"}
