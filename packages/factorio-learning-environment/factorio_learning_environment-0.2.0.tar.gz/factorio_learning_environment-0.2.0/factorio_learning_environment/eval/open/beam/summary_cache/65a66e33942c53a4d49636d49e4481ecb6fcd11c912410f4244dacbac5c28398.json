{"content": "The error indicates that the crafting process for the Stone Furnace failed because the required resource, stone, is not available in the inventory. Stone is a raw resource that must be gathered from the environment. Let's address this issue by gathering stone first and then proceed with crafting the necessary items.\n\n# Step 1: Gather Stone\nTo gather stone, you need to locate a stone resource patch in the game world. Move to a nearby stone patch and mine some stone manually.\n\n```python\n# Move to a known stone resource location\nstone_position = Position(x=10, y=10)  # Example coordinates; adjust based on your map\nmove_to(stone_position)\n\n# Mine stone until you have enough for crafting\ngather_resource(Prototype.Stone, quantity=10)  # Gather more than needed to ensure surplus\n```\n\n# Step 2: Craft the Stone Furnace\nOnce you have gathered enough stone, you can craft the Stone Furnace.\n\n```python\n# Craft the Stone Furnace now that stone is available\ncraft_item(Prototype.StoneFurnace, 1)\n```\n\n# Step 3: Craft Pipes\nEnsure you have enough pipes for the boiler recipe.\n\n```python\n# Check and craft pipes if necessary\npipes_needed = 4\ncurrent_pipes = inspect_inventory().get(Prototype.Pipe, 0)\nif current_pipes < pipes_needed:\n    craft_item(Prototype.Pipe, pipes_needed - current_pipes)\n```\n\n# Step 4: Craft the Boiler\nNow that all components are available, craft the Boiler.\n\n```python\n# Craft the Boiler\ncrafted_boiler = craft_item(Prototype.Boiler)\nassert crafted_boiler > 0, \"Failed to craft the Boiler.\"\n```\n\n# Step 5: Move and Place the Boiler\nEnsure you are close enough to the desired placement position before placing the Boiler.\n\n```python\n# Move closer to the placement position\nboiler_position = Position(x=pump_position.x, y=pump_position.y + 2)\nmove_to(boiler_position)\n\n# Place the Boiler\nboiler = place_entity(Prototype.Boiler, position=boiler_position)\n\n# Fuel the Boiler with coal\ninsert_item(Prototype.Coal, boiler, quantity=10)\n```\n\n# Step 6: Continue with the Steam Engine and Power Connections\nProceed with placing the Steam Engine and ensuring the power connections as previously outlined.\n\n```python\n# Place the Steam Engine\nsteam_engine_position = Position(x=boiler_position.x + 2, y=boiler_position.y)\nsteam_engine = place_entity(Prototype.SteamEngine, position=steam_engine_position)\n\n# Ensure the Small Electric Pole is correctly positioned\npole_entity = next((entity for entity in get_entities() if entity.name == \"small-electric-pole\"), None)\nif pole_entity:\n    if not pole_entity.position.is_close(steam_engine.position, tolerance=3):\n        pickup_entity(pole_entity)\n        pole_placement_position = Position(x=steam_engine.position.x + 1, y=steam_engine.position.y)\n        pole_entity = place_entity(Prototype.SmallElectricPole, position=pole_placement_position)\n\n    # Connect the power network components\n    connect_entities(pole_entity, steam_engine)\n    connect_entities(pole_entity, assembling_machine)\n\n# Verify the status of the entities\nfor entity in get_entities():\n    print(f\"Entity: {entity.name}, Status: {entity.status}\")\n\n# Confirm the setup is complete\nprint(\"Power setup and verification complete.\")\nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")\n```\n\n### Tips:\n- Always ensure you have gathered enough raw resources before attempting to craft items.\n- Check your inventory for the availability of items before crafting to avoid unnecessary errors.\n- Use `move_to()` to ensure you are within the required range for placing entities.", "summary_range": "[1-164]"}
