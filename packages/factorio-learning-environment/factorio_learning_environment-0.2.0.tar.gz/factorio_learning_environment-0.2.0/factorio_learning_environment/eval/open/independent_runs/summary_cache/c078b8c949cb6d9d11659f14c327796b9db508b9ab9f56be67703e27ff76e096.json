{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-2.5, 25.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Boiler at position (-2.5, 25.0), operational with coal as fuel.\n- Offshore Pump at position (-7.5, 25.5), supplying water.\n- PipeGroup connecting the offshore pump to the boiler, with pipes at positions (-6.5, 24.5), (-7.5, 24.5), (-4.5, 25.5), (-4.5, 24.5), and (-5.5, 24.5).\n\n### Pipe Network\n- PipeGroup at position (-12.5, 21.5), currently empty, with pipes at positions (-12.5, 21.5), (-11.5, 21.5), (-10.5, 23.5), (-10.5, 22.5), (-11.5, 22.5), and (-9.5, 23.5).\n\n### Electricity Network\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at various positions including (-3.5, 22.5), (-1.5, 22.5), (-0.5, 22.5), and others, currently with no voltage.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Using Extracting but Being Too Far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when Placing into a Tile Which is Occupied by Another Entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors with Offshore Pump Placement\n- Ensure that the offshore pump is placed adjacent to a water source and there is no obstruction.\n\n### Errors with Boiler Placement\n- Validate the position for boiler placement to ensure it is not obstructed and is adjacent to the necessary connections.\n\n### Errors with Pipe Connections\n- Ensure that the pipes are correctly connected between the offshore pump and the boiler for proper fluid transfer.\n\n### Errors with Steam Engine Placement\n- Ensure the steam engine is placed on suitable terrain and that there is no obstruction at the target location.\n\n### API Usage Errors\n- Ensure that string indices are integers when accessing string data.\n- Validate that all arguments passed to functions are of the correct type, such as ensuring integers are used where expected.\n- Avoid using non-callable objects as functions, such as attempting to call a 'Position' object.\n\n### Inventory Management Errors\n- Ensure sufficient resources, such as coal, are available in the inventory before attempting to refuel entities."}
