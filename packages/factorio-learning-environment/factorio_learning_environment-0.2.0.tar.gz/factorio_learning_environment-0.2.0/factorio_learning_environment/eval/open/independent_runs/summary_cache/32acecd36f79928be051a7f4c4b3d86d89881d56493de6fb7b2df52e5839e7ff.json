{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) which extracts iron ore and deposits it into a chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5) which stores extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5) which transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0) which is intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied tiles\n- Ensure there is no existing entity at the target position before attempting to place a new entity. Consider increasing the spacing, changing the direction, or selecting a different reference position.\n\n### Errors when placing entities too far from the player\n- Move closer to the target position before attempting to place an entity. The maximum placement distance is 10 tiles.\n\n### Errors in inserter setup\n- Verify that the inserter is correctly aligned to transfer items between the intended source and destination entities. Check that the inserter is fueled and properly positioned to pick up and drop items.\n\n### Errors when chest is full\n- Regularly empty the chest to prevent mining operations from halting due to a full inventory.\n\n### Furnace not receiving iron ore\n- Ensure the inserter is correctly configured and fueled to transfer iron ore from the chest to the furnace. Check that the furnace has enough fuel and is aligned to receive items from the inserter."}
