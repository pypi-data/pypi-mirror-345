{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Plate Production Facility at position (x=2.0, y=-63.0)\nThis structure is responsible for mining iron ore and smelting it into iron plates. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Burner mining drill** at position (x=2.0, y=-63.0) for extracting iron ore.\n- **Stone furnace** at position (x=4.0, y=-63.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner inserter** at position (x=3.5, y=-61.5) for transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Wooden chest** at position (x=2.5, y=-61.5) for storing iron ore before smelting.\n- **Wooden chest** at position (x=4.5, y=-61.5) for storing iron plates after smelting.\n\n#### Additional Stone Furnace at position (x=6.0, y=-63.0)\nThis furnace is currently idle due to a lack of ingredients. It consists of:\n- **Stone furnace** at position (x=6.0, y=-63.0) with no active smelting process.\n\n---\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors related to idle furnaces\n- **Furnace at (x=6.0, y=-63.0) has no ingredients to smelt**: Ensure that the furnace is supplied with iron ore and fuel (coal) to resume production. Consider adding an inserter to automate the transfer of materials.\n\n#### Errors related to inserter waiting for source items\n- **Burner inserter at (x=3.5, y=-61.5) is waiting for source items**: Verify that the chest at (x=2.5, y=-61.5) contains iron ore and that the inserter is correctly positioned to transfer items to the furnace.\n\n#### General tips for improving efficiency\n- **Automate coal supply**: Ensure that coal is consistently supplied to the burner mining drill and furnace to avoid interruptions in production.\n- **Expand production capacity**: Consider adding more mining drills and furnaces to increase iron plate production."}
