{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -49.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Transfer System at Position (40.0, -84.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (40.0, -84.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -83.5) receiving output from the mining drill.\n- Burner Inserter at position (41.5, -80.5) transferring items from the chest to another location.\n\n### Item Transfer System at Position (54.5, -83.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Inserter at position (54.5, -83.5) transferring items from a wooden chest at position (56.5, -83.5).\n\n### Belt System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- BeltGroup with inputs and outputs connecting various positions, facilitating the movement of coal and other items across the map.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items without available inventory\n- Ensure you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. For example, attempting to insert iron ore when none is available in the inventory will result in an error.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
