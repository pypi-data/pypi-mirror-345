{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (61.0, -54.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (61.0, -54.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (61.5, -52.5) for storing coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (62.5, -53.5) for storing coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (62.5, -52.5) for storing coal.\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) for extracting coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (41.5, -83.5) for transferring coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (40.5, -83.5) for storing coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (42.5, -83.5) for storing coal.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors with Inserter Operations\n- Ensure that inserters have a clear path to both source and destination entities. The inserter at position (41.5, -83.5) is waiting for source items, indicating a potential blockage or misalignment.\n\n### Errors with Full Furnace Output\n- Regularly monitor and empty furnace outputs to prevent production halts. The furnace at position (61.0, -54.0) frequently reaches full capacity, which stops further production.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- No utility functions or important variables have been defined or invoked in the provided steps."}
