{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -50.0) used for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-12.5, -49.5) used to transfer items between entities. It rotates between facing the furnace and the wooden chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-11.5, -49.5) used for storing items.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to insufficient inventory items\n- Ensure you have enough resources in your inventory before attempting to insert items into structures. Check your inventory levels regularly to avoid running out of essential materials like coal and iron ore.\n\n### Errors when using inserters\n- Make sure the inserter is correctly oriented towards the intended target entity (e.g., furnace or chest) before attempting to transfer items. Regularly verify the inserter's direction to ensure efficient operation.\n\n### Errors due to inserter fuel shortage\n- Keep the inserter adequately fueled to maintain continuous operation. Monitor fuel levels and refuel as necessary to prevent interruptions in item transfer processes."}
