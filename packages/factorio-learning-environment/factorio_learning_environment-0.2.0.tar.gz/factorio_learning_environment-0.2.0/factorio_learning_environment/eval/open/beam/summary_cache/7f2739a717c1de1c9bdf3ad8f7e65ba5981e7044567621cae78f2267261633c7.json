{"content": "# Factorio Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Patch at position(40.5, -82.5)\n- This structure is a coal patch that provides coal resources for energy production and crafting.\n\n### Iron Ore Patch at position(-15.5, -50.5)\n- This structure is an iron ore patch that provides iron ore resources for crafting and smelting.\n\n### Stone Patch at position(60.5, -54.5)\n- This structure is a stone patch that provides stone resources for crafting and building.\n\n### Stone Furnace at position(0.0, 0.0)\n- This structure is a stone furnace used for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- It consists of:\n  - Fuel: Coal (currently 17 units)\n  - Input: Iron Ore (currently 14 units)\n  - Output: Iron Plates (currently 5 units)\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position(-15.0, -50.0)\n- This structure is a burner mining drill used for extracting resources from the iron ore patch.\n- It consists of:\n  - Fuel: Coal (currently 4 units)\n  - Status: Working\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when crafting items\n- Ensure that all required ingredients are available in your inventory before attempting to craft an item. For example, the burner mining drill requires iron plates and iron gear wheels.\n\n### Errors when smelting\n- Check that the furnace has enough fuel and the required input materials before waiting for smelting to complete. If the furnace times out, it may indicate that inputs are missing or insufficient.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into the furnace\n- Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into the furnace. If you receive an error stating \"No iron-ore to insert from your inventory,\" it means you need to gather more iron ore.\n\n### Errors with recipe attributes\n- When accessing attributes of recipe objects, ensure that the attribute exists. For instance, the error regarding 'Recipe' object having no attribute 'count' indicates a possible misuse of the recipe object. Verify the correct attributes available for the recipe being used.\n\n### Errors when using incorrect types in function arguments\n- Ensure that the correct types are passed to functions. For example, when inserting items, the second argument must be an Entity or EntityGroup, not a Position.\n\n### Errors when attempting to place entities without required items\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to place an entity. For example, the wooden chest requires wood, which must be gathered first.\n\n### Errors when accessing entity attributes\n- Verify that the entity you are trying to access has the expected attributes. For example, if an entity does not have an 'x' attribute, it may indicate a misuse of the entity object."}
