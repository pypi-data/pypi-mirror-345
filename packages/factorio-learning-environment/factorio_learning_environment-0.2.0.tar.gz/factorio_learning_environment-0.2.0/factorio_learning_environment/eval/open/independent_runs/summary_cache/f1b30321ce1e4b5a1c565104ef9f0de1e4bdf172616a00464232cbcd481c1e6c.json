{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0): This drill is responsible for extracting iron ore and is currently fueled with coal.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5): This chest stores the iron ore extracted by the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5): This inserter is aligned to transfer iron ore from the wooden chest to a furnace. It is fueled with coal but is currently not transferring items due to setup issues.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates. However, it is not receiving any iron ore and has a warning indicating \"no ingredients to smelt\".\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Alignment and Functionality\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly aligned and positioned to pick up items from the source (wooden chest) and drop them into the destination (furnace). Verify that the inserter's pickup and drop positions are correctly set.\n- Check that there are no obstacles or misalignments preventing the inserter from functioning. Adjust the inserter's direction or reposition it if necessary.\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities\n- When placing entities like inserters, ensure there is sufficient space and no collisions with existing entities. Adjust the spacing, direction, or reference position to avoid placement errors."}
