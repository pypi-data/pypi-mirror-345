{"content": "It appears that the execution results are not being displayed beyond the initial diagnostic print statement. This suggests that there might be an issue with how the environment is set up or how the outputs are being captured and displayed. Here are some steps and suggestions to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Environment Setup**: Ensure that the Factorio REPL environment is correctly configured. Verify that all necessary components are initialized and that the environment is capable of executing commands and returning outputs.\n\n2. **Output Capture**: Check if there is a specific method or setting required to capture and display outputs from the REPL environment. Sometimes, outputs might be redirected or suppressed due to configuration settings.\n\n3. **Simplify Further**: Start with the most basic operations, such as printing a simple string, and gradually add complexity. This helps isolate the point at which the output stops being captured.\n\n4. **Error Handling**: Make sure that any exceptions are being caught and logged. This can provide insights into whether the issue is related to specific commands or operations.\n\n5. **Consult Documentation**: Review any available documentation for the Factorio REPL environment to ensure that you are using the correct syntax and methods for interacting with it.\n\n6. **Test in Isolation**: If possible, test the same commands in a different environment or setup to see if the issue persists. This can help determine if the problem is specific to the current setup.\n\n7. **Check for Updates**: Ensure that the environment and any related tools or libraries are up to date, as updates might resolve known issues.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to identify and resolve the issue with output not being displayed. If the problem persists, consider reaching out to support channels or forums related to the Factorio REPL environment for further assistance.", "summary_range": "[1-384]"}
