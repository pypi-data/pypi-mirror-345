{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nLocated at positions around x=-13.0, y=-48.0, this structure is responsible for producing iron plates. It consists of:\n- **Furnaces**: \n  - Stone Furnace at position (x=-13.0, y=-48.0) with a fuel inventory of coal and currently working.\n  - Stone Furnace at position (x=-11.0, y=-48.0) with a fuel inventory of coal and currently working.\n  - Stone Furnace at position (x=-9.0, y=-48.0) with a fuel inventory of coal and currently working.\n- **Burner Inserters**: \n  - Positioned at (x=-10.5, y=-49.5), (x=-11.5, y=-49.5), and (x=-8.5, y=-49.5) for supplying materials to the furnaces.\n- **Chests**: \n  - Iron chests and wooden chests are used for storing materials and outputs at various positions like (x=-14.5, y=-48.5), (x=-15.5, y=-48.5), and (x=-9.5, y=-49.5).\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing Facility\nLocated at positions around x=41.0, y=-82.0, this structure is responsible for mining and processing coal. It consists of:\n- **Burner Mining Drill**: \n  - Positioned at (x=41.0, y=-82.0) for mining coal, currently working.\n- **Furnace**: \n  - Stone Furnace at position (x=43.0, y=-82.0) for processing coal.\n- **Chests**: \n  - Iron chests at positions like (x=41.5, y=-80.5) for storing coal and iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserters**: \n  - Positioned at (x=43.5, y=-80.5) for transferring materials between entities.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inventory Management Errors\n- Ensure your inventory has enough space before attempting to harvest resources to avoid \"Inventory is full\" errors.\n- Regularly check and manage inventory levels to prevent running out of essential resources like iron ore.\n\n### Supply and Refueling Errors\n- Make sure you have the necessary resources in your inventory before attempting to supply them to furnaces or other entities.\n- Regularly refuel entities like furnaces and inserters to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Extraction Errors\n- Ensure that the target chest or entity has extractable resources before attempting to clear or extract from it to avoid \"must be greater than 0\" errors.\n\n### Placement and Blockage Errors\n- Regularly clear blockages at inserter drop positions to prevent interruptions in material flow.\n- Ensure that destination entities have enough space to receive items from inserters to avoid \"furnace belt at drop position is blocked\" warnings.\n\nBy addressing these errors and implementing the suggested tips, the efficiency and productivity of the structures can be significantly improved."}
