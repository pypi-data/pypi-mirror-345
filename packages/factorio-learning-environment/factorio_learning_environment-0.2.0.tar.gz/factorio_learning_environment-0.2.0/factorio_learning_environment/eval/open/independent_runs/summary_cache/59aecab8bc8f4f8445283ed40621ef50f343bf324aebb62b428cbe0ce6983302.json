{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0)\n  - Fuel: Inventory({'coal': 4})\n  - Status: Working\n  - Warnings: Output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Neighbours: Stone Furnace\n  - Drop Position: (x=-16.5, y=-52.5)\n  - Resources: Iron ore (40,000 units)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)\n  - Fuel: Inventory({'coal': 14})\n  - Status: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Furnace Result: Inventory({'iron-plate': 60})\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied locations\n- Ensure that the target location is free of other entities or items before attempting to place a new entity. This includes checking for items on the ground that might block placement.\n\n### Errors with undefined variables or incorrect references\n- Double-check variable names and ensure they are defined before use. If a variable is not defined, ensure it is correctly initialized or imported from the relevant module.\n\n### Errors when using items not available in inventory\n- Before attempting to use or insert items, verify that the required items are available in the inventory to avoid operation failures.\n\n### Errors with blocked outputs\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity, such as a chest or conveyor belt, to accept outputs from production entities like drills or furnaces to prevent blockages.\n\n### Errors when refueling or inserting items\n- Ensure that the correct item type is being inserted into the entity and that the entity is capable of accepting the item at the time of insertion."}
