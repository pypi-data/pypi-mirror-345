{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=20.5, y=-4.0)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (x=22.5, y=-7.5)\n- Boiler at Position (x=20.5, y=-4.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (x=19.5, y=-1.5)\n- Pipe Network connecting the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at Position (x=2.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=2.0, y=0.0)\n\n### Iron Plate Mine at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\n\n### Inserter and Chest Setup\nConsists of:\n- Inserter at Position (x=-3.5, y=1.5)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (x=-3.5, y=0.5)\n- Small Electric Poles providing power to the inserter\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Steam Engine Setup\n- Ensure that the steam engine is properly connected to a working boiler and has sufficient water supply. Check the pipe connections and ensure that the boiler is fueled and operational.\n\n### Attribute Errors with PipeGroup\n- Verify that you are accessing valid attributes of objects. The `PipeGroup` object does not have a `fluid` attribute. Ensure you are using the correct methods or attributes to access fluid information.\n\n### Inserter Power Issues\n- Make sure that inserters are connected to a power source and that the power source is active. Check the connections to small electric poles and ensure they are receiving electricity."}
