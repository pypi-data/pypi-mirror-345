{"content": "# FACTORIO AGENT REPORT\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining Operation at Position(41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of an automated coal mining and collection system:\n- Burner mining drill (position x=41.0, y=-82.0) mining from a coal patch\n- Wooden chest (position x=41.5, y=-80.5) collecting the mined coal (currently contains 12 coal)\n- Burner inserter (position x=42.5, y=-81.5) feeding coal back into the drill\n- The drill is currently working but has a warning that the chest is full\n\n### Iron Mining Operation at Position(3.0, -73.0)\nConsists of an iron ore mining setup:\n- Burner mining drill (position x=3.0, y=-73.0) mining from an iron ore patch\n- Wooden chest (position x=3.5, y=-71.5) collecting the mined iron ore (currently contains 6 iron ore)\n- The drill is currently working and producing iron ore\n\n### Iron Smelting Operation at Position(5.0, -71.0)\nConsists of a furnace for smelting iron ore:\n- Stone furnace (position x=5.0, y=-71.0) \n- The furnace is fueled with coal but currently has no ingredients to smelt\n\n### Original Stone Furnace at Position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of a stone furnace that has been used to smelt iron ore into iron plates:\n- Stone furnace (position x=0.0, y=0.0)\n- The furnace is fueled with coal but currently has no ingredients to smelt\n- Contains 1 iron plate in its output slot\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when crafting items requiring raw resources\n- Some items like wooden chests require raw resources (wood) that must be gathered from the environment\n- Ensure you have gathered necessary raw resources before attempting to craft items\n- Wood must be harvested from trees, it cannot be crafted\n\n### Errors when placing entities without having them in inventory\n- Attempted to place wooden chests and burner mining drills without having them in inventory\n- Craft required entities before attempting to place them\n\n### Errors with entity placement collisions\n- Attempted to place burner inserters in positions already occupied by other entities\n- Check the target position carefully before placing entities\n- Use the entity dimensions (height and width properties) to calculate proper placement positions\n- Consider using different directions or increasing spacing when placing entities near each other\n\n### Errors when inserting items that aren't in inventory\n- Attempted to insert coal into an inserter when there was none in inventory\n- Check inventory contents before attempting to insert items\n\n### Errors with mining drill output\n- The coal burner mining drill's output is now properly set up with a chest\n- When chests at drop positions become full, mining drills will stop working effectively\n- Regularly check and empty collection chests to maintain production\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\nNo functions have been defined by the agent yet."}
