{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES  \n\n#### Electricity Generator at position (x=-9.5, y=-0.5)  \n- **Offshore pump** at (x=-9.5, y=-0.5)  \n- **Boiler** at (x=-5.0, y=2.5) (fueled with coal)  \n- **Steam engine** at (x=0.5, y=6.5)  \n- **Small electric pole** at (x=3.5, y=6.5)  \n- **Pipe network** (fluid system 2492 for water, 2494 for steam)  \n  - Pipes connect boiler to steam engine, but steam engine input is blocked at (x=-6.5, y=2.5).  \n\n#### Oil Extraction and Processing Facility at position (x=17.5, y=40.5)  \n- **Pumpjack** at (x=17.5, y=40.5) (powered, extracting crude oil)  \n- **Storage tank** at (x=22.5, y=44.5) (connected via pipes)  \n- **Oil refinery** at (x=29.5, y=48.5) (powered, but crude oil input low at x=30.5, y=51.5)  \n- **Petroleum gas storage tank** at (x=35.5, y=49.5) (receiving gas from refinery)  \n- **Chemical plant** at (x=41.5, y=52.5) (powered, missing coal input from chest at x=39.5, y=52.5)  \n- **Wooden chest** at (x=39.5, y=52.5) (contains 100 coal, but no inserter to transfer to plant)  \n\n### ERROR TIPS  \n\n#### Entity Placement Errors  \n- **Repeated pole/inserter placement on occupied tiles**  \n  - Check for existing entities (e.g., `small-electric-pole` at x=3.5, y=6.5 or x=38.5, y=50.5) before placement.  \n  - Clear obstructing pipes/poles before placing inserters (e.g., at x=40.5, y=52.5).  \n\n#### Fluid System Issues  \n- **Steam engine input blocked at (x=-6.5, y=2.5)**  \n  - Reconnect boiler output (x=-6.5, y=2.5) to steam engine input (x=-2.0, y=6.5) with unobstructed pipes.  \n- **Low crude oil input to refinery**  \n  - Verify pumpjack output flow to storage tank and refinery input (x=30.5, y=51.5).  \n\n#### Power Grid Gaps  \n- **Chemical plant lacks coal input despite powered chest**  \n  - Place inserter between chest (x=39.5, y=52.5) and plant (x=41.5, y=52.5).  \n\n#### Resource Shortages  \n- **Chemical plant warnings for missing coal**  \n  - Ensure inserter is correctly configured to transfer coal from chest to plant.  \n\n#### API Usage  \n- **Invalid `get_entity` calls for non-existent poles/chests**  \n  - Verify entity existence with `find_entities` before fetching.  \n\n### NAMESPACE  \n*(No new functions defined by the agent in these steps.)*"}
