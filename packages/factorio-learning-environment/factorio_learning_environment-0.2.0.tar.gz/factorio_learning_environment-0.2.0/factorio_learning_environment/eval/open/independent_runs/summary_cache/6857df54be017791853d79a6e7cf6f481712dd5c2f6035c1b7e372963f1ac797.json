{"content": "## Report\n\n### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nThis facility is responsible for mining iron ore and smelting it into iron plates. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) with fuel inventory of coal, actively mining iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-14.5, -48.5) and (-15.5, -48.5) for storing mined resources.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5) transferring resources from the mining drill to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates, currently working with a fuel inventory of coal.\n- **Additional Stone Furnace** at position (-10.0, -48.0), currently not smelting due to lack of ingredients.\n\n#### Storage Area\nA series of wooden chests are used for storing iron plates:\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-6.5, -49.5), (-6.5, -48.5), (-7.5, -48.5), (-5.5, -48.5), and (-4.5, -48.5) with varying amounts of stored iron plates.\n- **Empty Wooden Chest** at position (-3.5, -48.5).\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Ensure to move close to the target entity before attempting to extract items to avoid extraction errors.\n\n#### Errors with inserters waiting for source items\n- Ensure that the source entity has items available for the inserter to pick up. Regularly check and refill the source entity if necessary.\n\n#### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure the destination tile is clear before attempting to place an entity to avoid blockage errors.\n\n#### Errors with inserters waiting for space in destination\n- Regularly clear the destination entity to ensure there is space for the inserter to place items, preventing blockage and ensuring smooth operation.\n\n#### Errors with extracting items from furnaces\n- Verify that the furnace has the required items available for extraction and that the extraction quantity is correct. Adjust the extraction logic to handle varying quantities or empty states."}
