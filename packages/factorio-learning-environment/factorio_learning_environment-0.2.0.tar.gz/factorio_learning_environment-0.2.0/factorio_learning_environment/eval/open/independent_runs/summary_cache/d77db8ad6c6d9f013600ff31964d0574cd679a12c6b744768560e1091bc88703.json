{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-10.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-10.0, -50.0): Currently out of fuel and has no ingredients to smelt.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-10.5, -48.5): Positioned to transfer items to/from the stone furnace, but is out of fuel and waiting for source items.\n\n### Belt Network\nConsists of the following belt groups:\n- BeltGroup 1: Inputs from (x=-15.5, y=-54.5) to (x=-13.5, y=-54.5), outputs from (x=-12.5, y=-54.5) to (x=-10.5, y=-54.5).\n- BeltGroup 2: Inputs from (x=-21.5, y=-51.5) to (x=-19.5, y=-51.5), outputs from (x=-15.5, y=-51.5) to (x=-15.5, y=-53.5).\n- BeltGroup 3: Inputs from (x=-14.5, y=-50.5) to (x=-16.5, y=-50.5), outputs from (x=-16.5, y=-55.5) to (x=-14.5, y=-55.5).\n- BeltGroup 4: Inputs from (x=-9.5, y=-50.5) to (x=-9.5, y=-52.5), outputs from (x=-9.5, y=-53.5) to (x=-9.5, y=-55.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Belt Path Creation\n- Ensure that the path for connecting transport belts is valid and can be normalized. Check for obstacles or incorrect alignment that might prevent successful connection.\n\n### Issues with Iron Plate Production\n- Investigate the lack of iron plates in the furnace. Ensure that the furnace has both fuel and ingredients to smelt. Verify that inserters are correctly positioned and fueled to transfer items.\n\n### Placement Errors for Wooden Chest\n- Before attempting to place a wooden chest, ensure that the target position is suitable and unoccupied by other entities."}
