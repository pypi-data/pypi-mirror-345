{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position(41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 41.0, -82.0) with a drop position at (41.5, -80.5) and a wooden chest as its neighbor. The drill is currently working but has a warning that the chest at the drop position is full.\n\n### Wooden Chest at position(41.5, -80.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest (position 41.5, -80.5) with an inventory containing coal. The chest is currently normal and serves as a storage for coal extracted by the burner mining drill.\n\n### Stone Furnace at position(-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position -15.0, -50.0) that is currently working. It has a source inventory containing iron ore and a result inventory that is full of iron plates, indicating that it cannot produce more until the output is cleared.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to full output\n- Ensure to empty the output of the stone furnace regularly to avoid it becoming full and halting production.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items to ensure successful extraction.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity on a tile before attempting to place it to avoid placement errors.\n\n### Repeated warnings from burner mining drill\n- The burner mining drill consistently warns that the chest at the drop position is full. Regularly check and empty the wooden chest to maintain mining operations.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the recent steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `coal`: Inventory containing coal, type: Inventory\n- `iron-ore`: Inventory containing iron ore, type: Inventory\n- `iron-plate`: Inventory containing iron plates, type: Inventory\n- `wooden-chest`: Wooden chest entity, type: Chest\n- `burner-mining-drill`: Burner mining drill entity, type: BurnerMiningDrill\n- `stone-furnace`: Stone furnace entity, type: Furnace"}
