Check the target location is clear.\n- Verify that you have the required pipes in your inventory before attempting to place them.\n- When connecting pipes, ensure that the positions are correctly aligned and within the connection range.\n\n### Errors in Entity Connection\n- Ensure that all components of the electricity generator (steam engine, boiler, and offshore pump) are properly connected to function correctly.\n- Verify that the electricity network is properly plugged in to distribute power.\n\n### Errors with Position Object\n- Avoid using 'Position' as a callable object. Ensure correct syntax and usage when working with position data."}
