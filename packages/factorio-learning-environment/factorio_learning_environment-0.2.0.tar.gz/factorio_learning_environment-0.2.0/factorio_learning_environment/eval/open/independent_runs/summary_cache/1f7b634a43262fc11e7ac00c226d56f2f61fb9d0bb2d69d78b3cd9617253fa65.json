{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line (x=1-3, y=1-3.5)\nConsists of two parallel smelting setups:\n- First setup: Stone furnace (x=1, y=1) with burner inserter (x=1.5, y=2.5) outputting to wooden chest (x=1.5, y=3.5)\n- Second setup: Stone furnace (x=3, y=1) with burner inserter (x=3.5, y=2.5) outputting to wooden chest (x=3.5, y=3.5)\n- Additional wooden chest at (x=5.5, y=3.5) with burner inserter (x=5.5, y=2.5)\n\n### Copper Plate Production Line (x=2-4, y=7-9.5)\nConsists of two parallel smelting setups:\n- First setup: Stone furnace (x=2, y=7) with burner inserter (x=2.5, y=8.5) outputting to wooden chest (x=2.5, y=9.5)\n- Second setup: Stone furnace (x=4, y=7) with burner inserter (x=4.5, y=8.5) outputting to wooden chest (x=4.5, y=9.5)\n- Connected by transport belts from y=8.5 to y=9.5\n\n### Power Generation System (x=2.5-13.5, y=35.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump (x=2.5, y=35.5) \n- Boiler (x=7, y=35.5)\n- Steam engine (x=13.5, y=35.5)\n- Connected by pipe groups carrying water and steam\n- Extensive electricity network connecting multiple poles across the map\n\n### Assembly Line System\nMultiple assembling machines and chests connected by inserters:\n- Copper cable assembling machine (x=14.5, y=14.5)\n- Electronic circuit assembling machine (x=21.5, y=15.5)\n- Multiple wooden chests and burner inserters forming input/output storage system\n- Connected by multiple belt groups forming logistics network\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Issues\n- Ensure proper spacing between entities to avoid overlapping placement issues\n- Consider the tile dimensions of larger entities (like assembling machines: 3x3 tiles) when planning layouts\n\n### Resource Flow Issues\n- Multiple inserters are waiting for source items - ensure proper supply chain connectivity\n- Some chests are reported as full - consider adding more downstream processing or storage capacity\n\n### Power System Warnings\n- Some fluid connections show \"No fluid present\" - ensure proper pipe connectivity and fluid flow\n- Check electrical network connections when placing new powered entities\n\n### Production Line Efficiency\n- Multiple assembling machines show ingredient shortages - ensure consistent supply of raw materials\n- Set up proper input/output logistics to maintain continuous production flow"}
