{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Various Positions\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnace at position (-20.0, -70.0)**: Fueled by coal, currently full of iron plates.\n- **Furnace at position (-18.0, -70.0)**: Fueled by coal, actively producing iron plates.\n- **Furnace at position (-19.0, -65.0)**: Fueled by coal, actively producing iron plates.\n- **Furnace at position (-21.0, -62.0)**: Fueled by coal, actively producing iron plates.\n- **Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)**: Fueled by coal, actively producing iron plates.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Transport System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0)**: Extracting coal and dropping into a wooden chest at position (52.5, -84.5).\n- **Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0)**: Extracting copper ore and dropping into a wooden chest at position (-23.5, -69.5).\n- **Transport Belt System**: Multiple belt groups connecting various positions to facilitate the movement of resources.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Transport System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0)**: Extracting iron ore and dropping into a wooden chest at position (-14.5, -54.5).\n- **Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5)**: Moving iron ore from chest to transport belt.\n\n### Storage and Inventory Management\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Wooden Chests**: Various positions storing resources like coal, iron ore, and iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Belt Connection\n- Ensure continuous placement of transport belts without gaps to connect entities effectively. Verify belt placement between positions such as x=-20.5, y=-67.5 and x=-21.5, y=-66.5 to avoid gaps.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entity has items available for the inserter to pick up. This can be resolved by checking the inventory of the source entity or ensuring it is actively producing items.\n\n### Furnace Output Full\n- Regularly check and clear the output of furnaces to prevent production halts. Consider adding more storage or transport solutions to manage the output effectively."}
