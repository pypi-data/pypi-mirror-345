{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo new structures have been successfully placed on the map. Multiple recovery attempts were made to deploy a Lab at position (0.5, 2.5) for supplying Automation Science Packs in support of research, but all placement and crafting operations failed due to resource shortages and inventory issues. No composite production structures have been created during these steps.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 API Misuse when Retrieving Entities\n\u2002 - Use the correct signature for get_entities. Avoid passing unexpected keyword arguments (such as \u201cradius\u201d) or extra positional arguments to prevent TypeErrors.\n\n\u2022 Lab Placement Failures\n\u2002 - Verify that the necessary Lab is available in the inventory before attempting placement. Incorporate checks to handle cases when entity-retrieval methods return None instead of valid lists.\n\n\u2022 Lab Crafting and Resource Chain Deficiencies\n\u2002 - Ensure that all prerequisite sub-ingredients (for example, iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, and copper-cables) are producible with the available resource conversion methods. Validate resource availability and the full supply chain (including smelting steps) before initiating Lab crafting.\n\u2002 - Use fallback values when filtering entity lists to avoid iteration over None, and double-check resource counts to meet crafting recipe requirements."}
