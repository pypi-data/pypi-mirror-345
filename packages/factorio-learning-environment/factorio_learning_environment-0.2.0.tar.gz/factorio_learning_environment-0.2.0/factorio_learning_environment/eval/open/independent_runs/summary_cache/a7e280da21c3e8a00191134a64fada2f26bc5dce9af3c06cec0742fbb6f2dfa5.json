{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=4.0, y=-60.0) with a drop position at (x=4.5, y=-58.5), currently working and fueled with coal. It has a warning indicating that the chest at the drop position is full.\n- Wooden Chests at positions (x=5.5, y=-60.5), (x=4.5, y=-58.5), (x=-5.5, y=-52.5), (x=-2.5, y=-52.5) for storing iron ore and iron plates.\n- Iron Chest at position (x=-3.5, y=-52.5) for storing iron plates.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage Area\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chests at positions (x=7.5, y=-60.5), (x=6.5, y=-60.5), (x=9.5, y=-60.5), (x=8.5, y=-60.5), (x=-11.5, y=-50.5), (x=-9.5, y=-50.5), (x=-8.5, y=-50.5), (x=-7.5, y=-50.5), (x=-6.5, y=-50.5), (x=-10.5, y=-50.5) for storing iron plates.\n- Iron Chests at positions (x=-6.5, y=-50.5), (x=-5.5, y=-50.5) for storing iron ore and iron plates.\n\n### Iron Smelting Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnaces at positions (x=-15.0, y=-48.0), (x=-13.0, y=-48.0), (x=-11.0, y=-48.0) fueled with coal, currently not smelting due to lack of ingredients.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Chest Full Warning\n- Ensure to regularly empty the chests at drop positions to prevent mining operations from halting due to full storage.\n\n### No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Ensure that furnaces are supplied with the necessary ingredients to maintain continuous smelting operations. Regularly check and replenish the input materials.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- **Utility Functions**: None defined or invoked in the current logs.\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `burner_mining_drill_position`: Position(x=4.0, y=-60.0)\n  - `iron_ore_inventory`: Inventory containing iron ore at various positions.\n  - `iron_plate_inventory`: Inventory containing iron plates at various positions.\n  - `furnace_positions`: Positions of stone furnaces that require input materials."}
