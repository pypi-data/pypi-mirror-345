{"content": "The execution result indicates two main issues:\n\n1. **Boiler Recipe Unavailability**: The recipe for the boiler is not enabled, which means it cannot be crafted at this point. This could be due to research requirements or game progression restrictions.\n\n2. **Placement Distance Error**: The attempted placement of the boiler is too far from the player's current position. The maximum placement distance is 10 units, but the target position is 20.5 units away.\n\n### Steps to Resolve:\n\n#### 1. Enable the Boiler Recipe\n- **Check Technology Requirements**: Ensure that the necessary technology for crafting a boiler is researched. This might involve researching the \"Steam Power\" or similar technology in the game.\n- **Enable the Recipe**: If the recipe is disabled due to a lack of research, focus on completing the required research tasks first.\n\n#### 2. Address the Placement Distance\n- **Move Closer to the Target Position**: Before attempting to place the boiler, move the player character closer to the desired placement location. Use the `move_to()` function to navigate to a position within 10 units of the target.\n  \n  ```python\n  # Move closer to the target position\n  move_to(Position(x=20, y=0))\n  ```\n\n- **Reattempt Placement**: Once closer, reattempt placing the boiler at the desired position.\n\n  ```python\n  # Place the Boiler after moving closer\n  boiler_position = Position(x=20.5, y=0.5)\n  boiler = place_entity(Prototype.Boiler, position=boiler_position)\n  ```\n\n### Additional Tips:\n- **Inventory Management**: Before crafting, always check if you have the necessary items in your inventory. If not, gather or craft the prerequisites first.\n- **Positioning Strategy**: Plan your layout to minimize the need for repositioning. Keep essential components within a reasonable distance to facilitate easy placement and connection.\n- **Debugging**: Use print statements to verify the current position and available items before executing actions that depend on these factors.\n\nBy addressing these issues, you should be able to successfully craft and place the boiler, ensuring your setup progresses smoothly.", "summary_range": "[1-162]"}
