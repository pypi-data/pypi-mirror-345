{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Network\n- Expanded power network connecting the lab at position (5.5, 5.5) to the power source at position (10.5, 34.5).\n- Consists of multiple electricity poles at positions such as (9.5, 23.5), (13.5, 27.5), (7.5, 13.5), (7.5, 9.5), (16.5, 31.5), and (12.5, 34.5).\n\n### Steam Power Generation Facility\n- Offshore Pump at position (-3.5, 27.5) providing water.\n- Boiler at position (0.5, 28.0) fueled with coal.\n- Steam Engine at position (10.5, 34.5) generating electricity.\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine.\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing Facility\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (40.0, -84.0) extracting coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (40.5, -82.5) storing extracted coal.\n- Belt system transporting coal from the mining site to other locations.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\n- Burner Inserter at position (54.5, -83.5) transferring items.\n- Wooden Chest at position (56.5, -83.5) storing iron plates.\n- Iron Chests at positions (0.5, 0.5), (1.5, 0.5), and (2.5, 0.5) storing coal and iron plates.\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\n- Furnace at position (-15.0, -49.0) for smelting copper ore into copper plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting boiler to steam engine\n- Ensure that pipes are correctly placed and connected between the boiler at position (0.5, 28.0) and the steam engine at position (10.5, 34.5). Check for any obstructions or misalignments in the pipe network.\n\n### Errors with insufficient power supply\n- Verify that the electricity network is fully connected and that all poles are correctly placed to ensure a stable power supply to all entities.\n\n### Errors with full inventory in chests\n- Regularly check and empty the chest at position (40.5, -82.5) to prevent mining operations from halting due to full inventory."}
