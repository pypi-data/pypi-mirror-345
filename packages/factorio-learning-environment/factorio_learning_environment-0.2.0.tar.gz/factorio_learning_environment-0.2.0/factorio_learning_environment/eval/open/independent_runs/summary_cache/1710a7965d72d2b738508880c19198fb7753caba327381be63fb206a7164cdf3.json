{"content": "# FACTORIO REPORT\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System (x=-9.5, y=1.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump (x=-9.5, y=1.5)\n- Boiler (x=-5.5, y=4.0) - currently out of fuel with warnings \"out of fuel\"\n- Steam engine (x=-0.5, y=7.5) - currently not working with warnings \"not connected to power network\", \"no input liquid\"\n- Pipe network connecting these components\n- Small electric pole (x=1.5, y=7.5)\n\nThe system was previously producing power but is currently not operational due to lack of fuel in the boiler. Coal was added in steps 65 and 69, but appears to have been consumed.\n\n### Iron Mining and Smelting Setup (x=18.5, y=73.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill (x=18.5, y=73.5) mining iron ore - currently not working due to power issues and full chest\n- Wooden chest (x=18.5, y=75.5) collecting iron ore from the drill (currently contains 646 iron ore)\n- Stone furnace (x=19.0, y=77.0) with 26 coal, currently working with 12 iron ore and 7 iron plates\n- Inserter (x=19.5, y=78.5) to move iron plates from furnace to chest - not working due to power issues\n- Wooden chest (x=19.5, y=79.5) for iron plate storage (currently contains 1 iron plate)\n- Chest output inserter (x=19.5, y=80.5) to extract plates from chest - not working due to power issues\n- Transport belt system starting at (x=19.5, y=81.5) with belts extending to (x=14.5, y=78.5) - currently contains 32 iron plates\n- Additional belt system from (x=8.5, y=75.5) to (x=9.5, y=77.5) connecting to the circuit assembly\n- Small electric poles (x=21.5, y=73.5), (x=20.5, y=75.5), (x=21.5, y=78.5), (x=21.5, y=80.5)\n\nThe system is partially working. The furnace is still smelting iron ore into plates, but the electric components (mining drill and inserters) are not working due to power issues.\n\n### Copper Mining and Smelting Setup (x=-48.5, y=78.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill (x=-48.5, y=78.5) mining copper ore - currently not working due to power issues and full chest\n- Wooden chest (x=-48.5, y=80.5) collecting copper ore from the drill (currently contains 624 copper ore)\n- Stone furnace (x=-48.0, y=82.0) with 25 coal, currently working with 12 copper ore and 7 copper plates\n- Inserter (x=-47.5, y=83.5) to move copper plates from furnace to chest - not working due to power issues\n- Wooden chest (x=-47.5, y=84.5) for copper plate storage (currently empty)\n- Chest output inserter (x=-47.5, y=85.5) to extract plates from chest - not working due to power issues\n- Transport belt system starting at (x=-47.5, y=86.5) extending to (x=-22.5, y=86.5) - currently contains 103 copper plates\n- Small electric poles (x=-45.5, y=78.5), (x=-46.5, y=80.5), (x=-45.5, y=83.5), (x=-45.5, y=85.5)\n\nThe system is partially working. The furnace is still smelting copper ore into plates, but the electric components (mining drill and inserters) are not working due to power issues.\n\n### Circuit Production System\nConsists of:\n\n#### Copper Cable Assembly (x=-6.5, y=74.5)\n- Assembling machine 2 (x=-6.5, y=74.5) set to produce copper cables - currently not working due to power issues\n- Input inser"}
