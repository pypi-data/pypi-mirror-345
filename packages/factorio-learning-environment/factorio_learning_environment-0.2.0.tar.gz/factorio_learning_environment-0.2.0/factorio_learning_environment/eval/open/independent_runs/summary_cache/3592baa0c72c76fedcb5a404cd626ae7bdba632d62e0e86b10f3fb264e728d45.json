{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-40.5, -113.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (-40.5, -113.5)\n- Multiple Small Electric Poles connecting various positions around the steam engine\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -76.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-15.5, -77.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -73.0)\n\n### Copper Plate Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (9.0, -64.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (6.0, -62.0)\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (7.5, -61.5)\n\n### Pipe Network\nConsists of multiple PipeGroups at various positions:\n- PipeGroup at position (-36.5, -122.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (-48.5, -112.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (-37.5, -111.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (-43.5, -109.5)\n- Additional PipeGroups spanning positions from (-1.5, 11.5) to (8.5, 30.5)\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of:\n- ElectricityGroup with poles spanning positions from (-13.5, -80.5) to (5.5, -53.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Undefined or Incorrectly Used Attributes\n- Ensure that all objects are correctly instantiated and have the necessary attributes before accessing them. For example, the error `'PipeGroup' object has no attribute 'prototype'` suggests that the `PipeGroup` object was not correctly checked for attributes it does not possess.\n\n### Errors Related to Undefined Names\n- Verify that all variables and classes are defined before use. The error `NameError: name 'Entity' is not defined` indicates that the `Entity` class or variable was not available in the current scope. Ensure all necessary imports and definitions are in place.\n\n### Errors When Using Extracting but Being Too Far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors When Placing into a Tile Which is Occupied by Another Entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placement."}
