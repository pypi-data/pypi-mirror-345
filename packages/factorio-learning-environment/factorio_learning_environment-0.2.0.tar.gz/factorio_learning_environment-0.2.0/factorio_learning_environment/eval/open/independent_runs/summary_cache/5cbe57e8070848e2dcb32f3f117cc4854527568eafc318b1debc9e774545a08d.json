Check for nearby entities like chests or other inserters that might block the placement.\n- Adjust spacing or change the direction of the inserter if placement fails due to existing entities.\n\n### Errors when connecting belts directly to chests\n- Use inserters to input items into chests instead of attempting to connect belts directly to them.\n\n### Errors when using inserters waiting for source items\n- Ensure that the source chest or entity has items available for the inserter to pick up. Check the inventory of the source entity before placing the inserter.\n\n### Errors when chests are full\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are full to prevent mining or production processes from halting."}
