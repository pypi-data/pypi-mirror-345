{"content": "I notice a pattern in my attempts - the inserter keeps getting placed at (-11.5, y=27.5) regardless of where I specify. Let me try a different approach:\n\n1. First, let's understand the layout:\n- Belt output is at (-10.5, 28.5)\n- Furnace is at (-10.0, 29.0)\n- Current inserter is at (-11.5, 27.5)\n\n2. Let's try placing the inserter with a different strategy:\n\n```python\n# First remove misplaced inserter\npickup_entity(Prototype.BurnerInserter, Position(x=-11.5, y=27.5))\n\n# Move to position near the furnace\nmove_to(Position(x=-10.0, y=28.5))\n\n# Try placing inserter with RIGHT direction to grab from belt and insert into furnace\ninserter = place_entity(\n    Prototype.BurnerInserter,\n    position=Position(x=-10.0, y=28.5),\n    direction=Direction.RIGHT\n)\n\nif inserter:\n    # Add fuel\n    insert_item(Prototype.Coal, inserter, quantity=5)\n    print(f\"Placed inserter at {inserter.position}\")\n    print(f\"Pickup position: {inserter.pickup_position}\")\n    print(f\"Drop position: {inserter.drop_position}\")\n\nprint(f\"Current inventory: {inspect_inventory()}\")\nprint(f\"Updated entity status: {get_entities()}\")\n```\n\nLet's see if this different position and direction helps align the inserter correctly between the belt and furnace.", "summary_range": "[1-432]"}
