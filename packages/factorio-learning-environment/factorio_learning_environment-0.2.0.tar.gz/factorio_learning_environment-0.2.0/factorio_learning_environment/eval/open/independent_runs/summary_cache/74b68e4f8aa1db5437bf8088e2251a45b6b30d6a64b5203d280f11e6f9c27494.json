{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Complex at (-10, -59)\nConsists of three burner mining drills in a row mining iron ore:\n- Burner mining drill at (-10.0, -59.0)\n- Burner mining drill at (-8.0, -59.0)\n- Burner mining drill at (-6.0, -59.0)\nConnected to wooden chests and transport belt system:\n- Wooden chest at (-9.5, -57.5) containing iron ore\n- Wooden chest at (-7.5, -57.5)\n- Wooden chest at (-5.5, -57.5) containing iron ore\nMultiple burner inserters manage material flow between components\n\n### Copper Processing Area at (-28, -61)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-28.0, -61.0) mining copper ore\n- Stone furnace at (-27.0, -59.0)\n- Wooden chest at (-24.5, -58.5) containing iron and copper plates\n- Burner inserter at (-25.5, -58.5) moving materials\n\n### Iron Smelting Array at (0, 0)\nLarge smelting array consisting of:\n- 5 stone furnaces at positions (0.0, 0.0), (2.0, 0.0), (4.0, 0.0), (6.0, 0.0)\n- Input wooden chests at (0.5, -2.5), (2.5, -2.5), (4.5, -2.5), (6.5, -2.5)\n- Output wooden chests at (0.5, 2.5), (2.5, 2.5), (4.5, 2.5), (6.5, 2.5) containing iron plates\n- Multiple burner inserters managing input and output\n\n### Additional Smelting Area at (-23, -58)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnaces at (-23.0, -58.0) and (-21.0, -58.0)\n- Wooden chest at (-22.5, -55.5) containing iron plates\n- Burner inserters managing material flow\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting transport belts to chests\n- Cannot connect transport belts directly to wooden chests\n- Must use inserters as intermediaries between belts and chests\n\n### Errors in belt path planning\n- Ensure there is a valid path between source and target positions when connecting transport belts\n- The path must be continuous and properly aligned\n- Check if the distance or route between connection points is feasible"}
