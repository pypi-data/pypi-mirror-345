{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-12.5, 24.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (-12.5, 24.5)\n- Boiler at position (-5.5, 25.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipes connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine:\n  - Pipe present at positions: (-5.5, 23.5), (-6.5, 23.5), (-8.5, 23.5), (-9.5, 23.5), (-10.5, 23.5), (-11.5, 23.5)\n  - Missing pipes were placed at positions: (-8.0, 25.0), (-7.0, 25.0), (-6.0, 25.0), (-5.5, 25.0), (-7.5, 23.5), (-12.5, 23.5)\n- Electric Pole at position (-13.5, 24.5) to connect the steam engine\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (15.0, 0.0) with coal as fuel\n- Inserters at positions (16.5, 0.5) and (17.5, 0.5) for moving items\n- Wooden Chests at positions (5.5, 0.5) and (18.5, 0.5) for storage\n- Small Electric Pole at position (17.5, -0.5) for power distribution\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- PipeGroup at position (-1.5, 17.5) and (1.5, 17.5) for fluid transport\n- PipeGroup at position (-12.5, 21.5) connecting to the steam engine\n- PipeGroup at position (-6.5, 20.5) for additional connections\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Steam Engine and Boiler Connections\n- Ensure all components of the electricity generator are properly connected. The steam engine and boiler are not connected to the power network and lack input liquid. Verify pipe connections and ensure fluid can flow from the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine.\n\n### Errors when Placing Pipes\n- Avoid placing pipes where the entity footprint overlaps with water. Check the terrain before placing pipes to ensure they can be placed successfully.\n\n### Errors with Inserters and Power\n- Ensure inserters are connected to a power source. The inserters are not receiving electricity, which prevents them from operating. Verify the connection between inserters and electric poles.\n\n### Repeated Placement of Pipes\n- Avoid repeatedly placing pipes in the same positions without resolving connection issues. Ensure that the pipes form a complete and functional network to transport fluids effectively.\n\n### Offshore Pump Connection Issues\n- Ensure the offshore pump is properly connected to the pipe network. The pump is not supplying fluid due to connection issues. Check the alignment and connectivity of pipes leading from the pump."}
