{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (0.5, 23.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Boiler** at position (0.5, 23.0), currently fueled and working, connected to pipes.\n- **Steam Engine** at position (7.5, 23.5), not plugged into the electric network, connected to the boiler.\n- **Offshore Pump** at position (-9.5, 24.5), working and connected to the water supply system.\n- **Pipe Group** connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and the boiler to the steam engine, facilitating fluid flow.\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (17.5, 20.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Steam Engine** at position (17.5, 20.5), working and connected to a pipe network.\n- **Pipe Group** facilitating steam flow to the steam engine.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities\n- Ensure that the target location for placing entities like steam engines is free from obstacles and not on unplaceable terrain such as water.\n- Verify inventory for required items before attempting to place them.\n\n### Connection Errors\n- When connecting pipes, ensure that there are no blockages and that the path is clear for the connection.\n- Ensure that all components in a fluid system are correctly connected to avoid disconnections.\n\n### Electrical Network Connection\n- Ensure that steam engines are connected to the power network to function properly. Check for suitable positions for placing electric poles to facilitate this connection.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- **place_entity**: Attempts to place an entity at a specified position. Ensure inventory has the entity and the position is valid.\n\n### Important Variables\n- **steam_engine_position**: Position where the steam engine is intended to be placed.\n- **boiler_position**: Position of the boiler in the electricity generator setup.\n- **offshore_pump_position**: Position of the offshore pump in the water supply system.\n\nThis report summarizes the current structures and provides guidance on avoiding errors encountered during the recent steps."}
