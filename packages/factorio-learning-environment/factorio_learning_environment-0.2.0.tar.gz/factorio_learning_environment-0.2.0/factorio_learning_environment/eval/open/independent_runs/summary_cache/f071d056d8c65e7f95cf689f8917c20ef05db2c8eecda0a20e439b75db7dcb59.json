{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (x=53.0, y=-83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=53.0, y=-83.0) connected to two Wooden Chests at positions (x=52.5, y=-84.5) and (x=54.5, y=-84.5) for coal storage.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Storage Facility at Position (x=-23.0, y=-68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-23.0, y=-68.0) connected to Wooden Chests at positions (x=-23.5, y=-69.5) and (x=-24.5, y=-67.5) for copper ore storage.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-54.5) for iron ore storage.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-54.5) transferring items between chests at positions (x=-14.5, y=-54.5) and (x=-12.5, y=-54.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Storage Facility at Position (x=-16.5, y=-64.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-16.5, y=-64.5) storing iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-15.5, y=-64.5) transferring items between chests at positions (x=-16.5, y=-64.5) and (x=-14.5, y=-64.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Processing Facility at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=1.5, y=0.5) storing iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=2.5, y=0.5) transferring items between chests at positions (x=1.5, y=0.5) and (x=3.5, y=0.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Crafting Wooden Chests\n- Ensure that there are enough resources in the inventory before attempting to craft items. The crafting of wooden chests failed due to insufficient wood.\n\n### Errors with Full Storage\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are full to prevent mining drills from halting operations due to lack of space in destination chests.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that there is a continuous supply of items to be transferred by inserters to prevent them from idling and waiting for source items."}
