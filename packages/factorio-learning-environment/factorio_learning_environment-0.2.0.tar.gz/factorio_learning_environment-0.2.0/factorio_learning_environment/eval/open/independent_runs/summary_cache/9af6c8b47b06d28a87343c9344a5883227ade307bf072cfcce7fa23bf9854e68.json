{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5) storing extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5) transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0) intended for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Coal Supply System\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) refueled with coal to maintain operation.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5) also refueled with coal to ensure continuous transfer of iron ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Misalignment Issues\n- Ensure that inserters are correctly aligned with their source and destination entities. Repeated repositioning indicates initial misalignment. Verify pickup and drop positions before finalizing placement.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Iron Ore\n- Check the setup of inserters and ensure they are properly configured to deliver iron ore to the furnace. Regular checks and adjustments may be necessary to maintain operational flow.\n\n### Insufficient Inventory for Operations\n- Ensure that the necessary resources, such as coal, are available in your inventory before attempting to refuel or insert items into entities. This will prevent interruptions in operations due to resource shortages."}
