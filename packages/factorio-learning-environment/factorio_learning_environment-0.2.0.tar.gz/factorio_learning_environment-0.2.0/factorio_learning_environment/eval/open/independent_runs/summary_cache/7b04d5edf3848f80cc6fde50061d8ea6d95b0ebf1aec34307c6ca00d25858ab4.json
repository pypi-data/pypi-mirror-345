{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility\n- **Location**: \n  - Wooden Chest at Position: x=-16.5, y=-52.5\n  - Burner Mining Drill at Position: x=-16.0, y=-51.0\n  - Stone Furnace at Position: x=-14.0, y=-49.0\n- **Components**:\n  - **Burner Mining Drill**: Extracts iron ore from the resource patch. Currently out of fuel and unable to drop more items as the chest is full.\n  - **Wooden Chest**: Stores extracted iron ore. Positioned to receive items from the mining drill.\n  - **Stone Furnace**: Used to smelt iron ore into iron plates. Currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing Burner Inserter\n- Ensure the placement location for the Burner Inserter is valid and not occupied by another entity. Adjust the position if necessary to avoid placement errors.\n\n### NameError when using undefined variables\n- Verify that all variables are defined before use. In this case, ensure that 'chest_inserter' is properly declared and initialized before accessing its properties.\n\n### Errors when connecting belts directly from a chest\n- Use an inserter to transfer items from a chest to a belt. Belts cannot be directly connected to a chest.\n\n### Errors due to lack of resources for operations\n- Ensure that the required resources, such as fuel or ingredients, are available in the inventory before attempting operations like refueling or smelting."}
