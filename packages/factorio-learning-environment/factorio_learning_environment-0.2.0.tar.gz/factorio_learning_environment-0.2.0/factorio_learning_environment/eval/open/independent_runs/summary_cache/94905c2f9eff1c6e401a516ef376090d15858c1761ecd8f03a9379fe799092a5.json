{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-14.0, -49.0)\nThis facility is responsible for producing iron plates from iron ore. It consists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) with coal as fuel and iron ore as input.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-12.0, -48.0) with coal as fuel and iron ore as input.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -47.5) waiting for source items, connected to the furnaces.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-13.5, -46.5) storing iron plates.\n- Transport Belts connecting the furnaces to the chest.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage and Distribution System\nThis system stores and distributes iron plates produced in the facility:\n- Wooden Chest at position (-13.5, -46.5) storing iron plates.\n- Transport Belts connecting the chest to other parts of the facility.\n- Burner Inserters at positions (-14.5, -45.5) and (-9.5, -44.5) waiting for source items, facilitating movement of items.\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-7.0, 23.5)\nThis structure generates electricity for the facility:\n- Steam Engine at position (-3.5, 23.5).\n- Boiler at position (-7.0, 23.5) with coal as fuel.\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5) supplying water to the boiler.\n- Pipe Group connecting the offshore pump to the boiler.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the inserters have a continuous supply of source items. Check the connected entities and ensure they are operational and have the necessary resources.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Out of Fuel\n- Regularly check and refuel inserters to prevent them from running out of fuel. Consider automating fuel supply to inserters.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Blocked by Full Destination\n- Ensure that the destination inventory (e.g., chests) has enough space to accept items from inserters. Regularly clear or expand storage as needed.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Output Blocked\n- Ensure there is a clear path for inserters to drop items. Check for blockages on belts or in destination inventories.\n\n### Errors with Insufficient Inventory for Operations\n- Maintain a sufficient inventory of necessary items (e.g., coal) to prevent operation failures. Regularly harvest or craft required items to avoid shortages."}
