{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Stone Furnace at position (42.0, -81.0)\n- **Stone Furnace** (position: 42.0, -81.0): Used for smelting iron ore into iron plates. Currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n- **Burner Inserter** (position: 43.5, -80.5): Transfers items between the stone furnace and the wooden chest. Fueled by coal and currently waiting for source items.\n- **Wooden Chest** (position: 44.5, -80.5): Stores iron plates. Currently contains 69 iron plates.\n\n#### Burner Mining Drill at position (42.0, -83.0)\n- **Burner Mining Drill** (position: 42.0, -83.0): Used to mine coal. Currently out of fuel and requires coal to operate.\n\n---\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when attempting to insert items without required items in inventory\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities like furnaces or mining drills. For example:\n  - **Iron Ore**: Required for smelting in the furnace.\n  - **Coal**: Required as fuel for the furnace, burner inserter, and burner mining drill.\n\n#### Errors when crafting items without required sub-ingredients\n- Ensure you have all necessary sub-ingredients before attempting to craft items. For example:\n  - **Transport Belt**: Requires iron plates, which must be smelted in a furnace.\n  - **Burner Mining Drill**: Requires iron plates and iron gear wheels.\n\n#### Errors when placing entities on occupied or invalid tiles\n- Ensure the target tile is free and valid before attempting to place an entity. For example:\n  - Check for existing entities or unplaceable terrain (e.g., water) at the target position before placing a new entity.\n\n#### Errors when extracting items without being near the target entity\n- Ensure you are near the target entity (e.g., furnace or chest) before attempting to extract items from it.\n\n#### Errors when crafting items without a crafting machine or furnace\n- Ensure you have the necessary crafting machine or furnace to craft items. For example:\n  - **Iron Plate**: Requires smelting in a furnace.\n  - **Iron Gear Wheel**: Requires an assembling machine or similar crafting entity.\n\n#### Errors when using incorrect API parameters\n- Ensure the correct parameters are used when calling API functions. For example:\n  - Use valid position objects with correct `x` and `y` attributes when moving or placing entities.\n  - Use the correct data types (e.g., integers) for parameters like width and height in functions like `BuildingBox`.\n\n#### Errors when inserting items into a full inventory\n- Ensure the target entity's inventory is not full before attempting to insert items. For example:\n  - Check the furnace's fuel inventory before inserting coal.\n\n#### Errors when placing entities without the required items in inventory\n- Ensure you have the required entity in your inventory before attempting to place it. For example:\n  - **Burner Mining Drill**: Requires the drill to be in your inventory before placing it."}
