{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (5 units)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Warnings: Output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Neighbours: Stone Furnace\n  - Drop Position: (-16.5, -52.5)\n  - Resources: Iron Ore (40,000 units)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-14.0, -49.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (14 units)\n  - Status: No Ingredients\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Furnace Source: Empty\n  - Furnace Result: Iron Plate (60 units)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied or invalid locations\n- Ensure the desired location for placing entities such as Wooden Chests, Burner Inserters, Stone Furnaces, and Transport Belts is unoccupied and valid before attempting placement. This will prevent errors like \"Cannot place [entity] at the desired location.\"\n\n### Errors when moving entities to occupied or invalid locations\n- Verify that the target location for moving entities such as Stone Furnaces is clear and valid to avoid errors like \"Cannot move Stone Furnace to the desired location.\"\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities from invalid positions\n- Confirm the existence of the entity at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it to avoid errors like \"Could not get Prototype.StoneFurnace at position x=-16.5 y=-52.5.\"\n\n### Warnings related to blocked outputs\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity in place to accept the output from entities like Burner Mining Drills to prevent warnings such as \"output blocked by item on the ground.\"\n\n### Warnings related to missing ingredients\n- Make sure that the required ingredients are available for entities like Stone Furnaces to function properly and avoid warnings like \"no ingredients to smelt.\""}
