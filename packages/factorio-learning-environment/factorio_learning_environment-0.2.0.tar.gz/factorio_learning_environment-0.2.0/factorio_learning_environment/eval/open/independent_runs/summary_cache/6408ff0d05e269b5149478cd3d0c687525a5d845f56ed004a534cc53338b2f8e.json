{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nNo structures have been successfully created on the map as of the latest execution steps. All attempts to place entities have failed due to various constraints and issues.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities due to hidden constraints\n- Ensure that there are no hidden constraints in the area before attempting to place entities like Wooden Chests. Consider checking for any invisible or non-obvious restrictions that might be affecting placement.\n\n### Errors when placing entities due to global or map-wide restrictions\n- Verify global settings or map-wide restrictions that might be preventing the placement of entities. Adjust settings or choose a different location if necessary.\n\n### Errors when placing entities due to potential cross-type issues\n- Check for compatibility issues between different types of entities before attempting placement. Ensure that the chosen location and entity type are compatible.\n\n### Errors when placing entities due to persistent issues\n- Persistent placement issues may require a review of the overall strategy or settings. Consider revisiting the game settings or consulting documentation for potential solutions.\n\n### Errors due to incorrect data types in movement commands\n- Ensure that the correct data types are used in movement commands. For example, indices must be integers, not strings, to avoid errors during execution."}
