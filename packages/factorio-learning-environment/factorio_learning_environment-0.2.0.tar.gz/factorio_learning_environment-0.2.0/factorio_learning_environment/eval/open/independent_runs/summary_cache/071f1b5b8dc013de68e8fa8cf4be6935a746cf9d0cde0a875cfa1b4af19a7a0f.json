{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-46.5, -119.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (-40.5, -113.5)\n- Pipe connections between these entities, including PipeGroup at various positions such as (-47.5, -122.5) and (-46.5, -122.5).\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-15.0, -76.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at Position (-15.5, -77.5) for iron ore collection.\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-19.0, -73.0) for smelting iron ore into copper plates.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0) and Position (6.0, -62.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) for transferring materials between entities, connected to a Wooden Chest at Position (6.5, -59.5).\n\n### Storage and Research\nConsists of:\n- Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5) storing iron plates.\n- Lab with input for automation science packs, currently not in progress.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Pipe Connections\n- Ensure that pipes are correctly aligned and connected between the intended entities. Check the positions and ensure there are no gaps or misalignments in the pipe network.\n\n### Steam Engine Not Receiving Steam\n- Verify that the steam engine is properly connected to the boiler with a continuous pipe network. Ensure that the boiler is receiving water from the offshore pump and is fueled correctly to produce steam.\n\n### Inserter Not Receiving Electricity\n- Check the electrical connections and ensure that the inserter is connected to a power network. Verify that the small electric poles are correctly placed and connected to provide power to the inserter.\n\n### Full Chest Warning\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are full to prevent production halts. Ensure that there is sufficient storage space for mined resources.\n\n### No Ingredients in Furnace\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Regularly supply the required ores to maintain continuous production."}
