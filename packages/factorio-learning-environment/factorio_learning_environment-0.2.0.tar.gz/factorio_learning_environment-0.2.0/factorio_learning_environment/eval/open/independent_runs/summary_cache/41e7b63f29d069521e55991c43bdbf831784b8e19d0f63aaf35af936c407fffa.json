{"content": "Here's the report based on the provided execution logs:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing Line (y=-79.5 to -82.0)\nA coal processing line consisting of:\n- Burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0) mining coal\n- Transport belt system running from x=41.5 to x=45.5 at y=-79.5 (5 belts in sequence, all facing right)\n- Burner inserter at (46.5, -79.5) with pickup at (45.5, -79.5) and drop at (47.5, -79.5)\n- Stone furnace at (48.0, -80.0)\n\nCurrent operational status:\n- Mining drill is waiting for space in destination\n- Belt system is working with 1 coal in transit\n- Burner inserter is waiting for source items\n- Furnace has no ingredients but contains 50 coal as fuel\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Conflicts\n- When placing inserters, ensure there is adequate clearance from other structures - there was an error placing inserter at (47.0, -80.0) due to collision\n- Consider the full size of entities when planning layouts - furnaces are 2x2 tiles while inserters and belts are 1x1\n\n### Alignment Issues\n- Multiple attempts were needed to align the inserter with furnace properly\n- When building production lines, plan the exact positions considering:\n  - Entity sizes (especially 2x2 buildings like furnaces)\n  - Inserter reach distances\n  - Belt connections\n- Use grid positions for larger entities first, then position smaller entities relative to them\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nImportant Variables:\n- `inserter`: BurnerInserter type\n- `furnace`: Furnace type\n- `belt_group`: BeltGroup type containing multiple connected belts\n\nFunctions:\n- `place_entity()`: Places entities on the map, fails if location is blocked\n- `verify_belt_direction()`: Checks if belts are oriented correctly\n- `verify_system_operation()`: Checks status of entire production line components"}
