{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n###Iron Plate Production Line at (-73.0)\nConsists of two stone furnaces for smelting iron ore:\n- First stone furnace at position (3.0, -73.0)\n- Second stone furnace at position (5.0, -73.0)\nBoth furnaces are operational, containing coal as fuel and have iron plates as output. Each furnace currently has:\n- 23 coal units as fuel\n- 13 iron plates as output\nCurrently waiting for new ingredients to smelt\n\n###Copper Mining and Smelting Setup at (-73.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill positioned at (-21.0, -73.0) targeting copper ore deposit\n- Stone furnace at (-18.0, -73.0) for smelting copper ore\nCurrent status:\n- Mining drill has 17 coal units as fuel\n- Mining drill is waiting for space in destination\n- Furnace has 25 coal units as fuel\n- Drop position is at (-21.5, -74.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n###Errors when attempting to place entities at invalid locations\n- Stone furnaces require a 2x2 tile space for placement\n- Cannot place furnaces directly at mining drill drop positions, offset the position slightly to ensure proper spacing\n- When placing a new furnace, ensure the target location is completely clear of other entities and drops\n- Verify there are no items on the ground at the placement location\n- When placing furnaces near mining drills, ensure the position is not overlapping with the drill's drop zone\n\n###Resource Pickup Errors\n- Ensure resources are actually present at the target location before attempting pickup\n- Verify the exact coordinates when attempting to pick up resources\n- Check if resources are being blocked or are inaccessible due to other entities\n- Wait for resources to be available before attempting pickup operations\n- Do not attempt to pick up resources from a mining drill's drop position if the drill hasn't produced any yet\n\n###Entity Placement and Alignment Tips\n- When setting up mining-furnace-inserter systems:\n  1. Place the mining drill first\n  2. Note the exact drop position\n  3. Place furnace with slight offset from drop position\n  4. Place inserter between drill's drop position and furnace\n  5. Verify inserter's pickup position matches drill's drop position\n  6. Add fuel to all components before starting operation\n\n###Resource Management Tips\n- Keep track of essential resources like coal in inventory\n- Plan ahead to ensure you have all necessary materials before starting new construction\n- When setting up mining operations, always ensure there's a destination entity at the drop position before starting the mining drill\n\n###Inserter Placement and Rotation Issues\n- Verify the drop position of mining equipment before placing inserters\n- Ensure inserter's pickup position aligns with the mining drill's drop position\n- Double-check inserter rotation to ensure proper material flow direction\n- Ensure there is enough space between mining drill and furnace for inserter placement\n\n###Operating Equipment without Fuel\n- Always insert fuel into new inserters immediately after placement\n- Keep coal in inventory for fueling new equipment\n- Check fuel levels of existing equipment regularly\n\n###Alignment and Distance Issues\n- The distance between mining drill's drop position and furnace/inserter setup must be properly calculated\n- When cleaning up misaligned setups, ensure new placements are properly positioned relative to existing structures\n- Consider the entire production line layout before placing individual components"}
