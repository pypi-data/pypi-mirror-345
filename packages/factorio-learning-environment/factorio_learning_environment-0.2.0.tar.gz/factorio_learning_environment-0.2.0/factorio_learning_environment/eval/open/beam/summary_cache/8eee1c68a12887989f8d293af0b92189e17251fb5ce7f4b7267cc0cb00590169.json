The updated inventory now reflects:\n- 2 pieces of stone furnaces\n- **5 pieces of iron ore**\n- **5 pieces of copper ore**\n- **3 pieces of iron plates**\n\nThe furnace is currently working with:\n- **7 pieces of copper ore** being processed\n- **10 pieces of iron plates** produced so far\n\n### Current Status:\n- The furnace is operational and processing copper ore, but the copper plate recipe remains disabled, which means I won't see any output from that processing.\n- I have a reasonable stockpile of resources, but crafting options are still limited due to disabled recipes.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Continue Monitoring the Furnace**: I will keep an eye on the furnace to see if it produces any copper plates, even though the recipe is disabled.\n2. **Consider Crafting Other Items**: I should explore if there are any other items I can craft with the available resources, especially focusing on iron plates.\n3. **Gather More Resources**: I may want to continue gathering resources to ensure I have enough for future crafting opportunities once recipes are enabled.\n\nFor now, I will wait a moment to see if the furnace completes processing the copper ore and check its output.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Wait for the furnace to process the copper ore\nsleep(10)  # Allow time for the furnace to process\n\n# Check the status of the furnace and the output after waiting\nfurnace_inventory_final_status = inspect_inventory(new_furnace)\nprint(f\"Final furnace status and inventory after processing: {furnace_inventory_final_status}\")  # Final furnace status\nprint(f\"Overall current inventory after waiting: {inspect_inventory()}\")  # Check the overall inventory again after the wait.\nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")  # Check entities on the map again.", "summary_range": "[1-122]"}
