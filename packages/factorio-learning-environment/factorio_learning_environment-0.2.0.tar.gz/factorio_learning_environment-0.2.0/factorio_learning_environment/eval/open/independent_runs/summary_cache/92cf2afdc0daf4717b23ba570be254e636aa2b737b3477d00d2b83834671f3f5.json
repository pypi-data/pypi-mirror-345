{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage at Position (4.0, -60.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (4.0, -60.0) with a drop position at (4.5, -58.5), currently working with fuel status.\n- Wooden Chest at position (4.5, -58.5) storing iron ore.\n- Multiple Wooden Chests at positions (-5.5, -52.5), (-14.5, -50.5), (-13.5, -50.5), (-12.5, -50.5) storing iron ore.\n- Iron Chest at position (-5.5, -50.5) storing iron ore and iron plates.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Multiple Stone Furnaces at positions (-15.0, -48.0), (-13.0, -48.0), (-11.0, -48.0) with warnings indicating no ingredients to smelt and full furnace results.\n- Wooden Chests at positions (-11.5, -50.5), (-10.5, -50.5), (-9.5, -50.5), (-8.5, -50.5), (-7.5, -50.5), (-6.5, -50.5) storing iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Chest Capacity\n- Ensure chests are emptied regularly to prevent mining drills from halting due to full storage. The chest at (4.5, -58.5) is full, causing the mining drill to stop.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Operations\n- Check that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Furnaces at positions (-15.0, -48.0), (-13.0, -48.0), (-11.0, -48.0) are not operational due to a lack of ingredients and full output slots.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `drill_status`: EntityStatus, indicating the operational status of the mining drill.\n- `fuel`: Integer, representing the remaining fuel in the mining drill.\n- `inventory`: Dictionary, representing the contents of chests and furnaces."}
