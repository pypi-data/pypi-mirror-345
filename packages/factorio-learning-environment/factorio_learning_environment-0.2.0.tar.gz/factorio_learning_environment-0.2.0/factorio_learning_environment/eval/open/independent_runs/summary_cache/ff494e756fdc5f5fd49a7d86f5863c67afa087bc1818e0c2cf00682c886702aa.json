{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (x=53.0, y=-83.0)\n- Consists of a Burner Mining Drill at position (x=53.0, y=-83.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=52.5, y=-84.5).\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Transportation System at Position (x=-23.0, y=-68.0)\n- Consists of a Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-23.0, y=-68.0) connected to a network of transport belts and a Wooden Chest at position (x=-23.5, y=-69.5).\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage Facility at Position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0)\n- Consists of a Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=-12.5, y=-54.5) and a Burner Inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-54.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Smelting Facility at Position (x=-21.0, y=-62.0)\n- Consists of a Stone Furnace at position (x=-21.0, y=-62.0) with a Wooden Chest at position (x=-20.5, y=-63.5) for storing iron plates.\n\n### Small Iron Plate Smelting Facility at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\n- Consists of a Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with a Wooden Chest at position (x=1.5, y=0.5) for storing iron plates and a Burner Inserter at position (x=2.5, y=0.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when attempting to access non-existent entities\n- Ensure that the entity exists at the specified position before attempting to access it. This can be done by verifying the entity's presence on the map before calling functions that require the entity.\n\n### Attribute Errors with BeltGroup objects\n- Avoid assuming that BeltGroup objects have attributes of other entity types. Ensure that the correct methods and attributes are used for the specific object type you are working with."}
