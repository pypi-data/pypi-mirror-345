{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Setup at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and deposits it into a nearby chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the stone furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates, but currently not receiving iron ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Setup\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items from the chest to the furnace. Frequent repositioning indicates potential misalignment issues.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Not Receiving Iron Ore\n- Verify that the inserter is functioning correctly and that there are no blockages or misconfigurations preventing the transfer of iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n\n### Errors with Extracting Items from an Empty Chest\n- Check the chest's inventory before attempting to extract items to ensure it contains the desired resources. Attempting to extract from an empty chest will result in errors.\n\n### Errors with Mining Drill Out of Fuel\n- Regularly refuel the burner mining drill to prevent it from running out of fuel, which halts the mining process. Ensure a steady supply of coal to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Errors with Full Chest\n- Regularly monitor and clear the chest to prevent it from becoming full, which will stop the mining drill from depositing more iron ore."}
