{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n###Coal Mining Operation at (-14.0, -15.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (24.0, -15.0) mining coal\n- Wooden chest (23.5, -16.5) storing coal with 210 units\n\n###Iron Mining Operation at (-14.0, 23.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (-14.0, 23.0) mining iron ore\n- Wooden chest (-14.5, 21.5) storing iron ore with 782 units\n\n###Copper Processing Line at (20.0, 20.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (20.0, 20.0) mining copper ore\n- Wooden chest (20.5, 21.5) storing copper ore with 133 units\n- Stone furnace (24.0, 20.0) for smelting copper plates\n- Wooden chest (24.5, 17.5) storing copper plates with 53 units\n- Burner inserter (24.5, 18.5) moving items from furnace to output chest\n- Wooden chest (22.5, 21.5) storing copper ore with 401 units\n- Burner inserter (22.5, 20.5) moving items from input chest to furnace\n\n###Unused Furnaces\nTwo stone furnaces at:\n- Position (-11.0, 20.0)\n- Position (-9.0, 20.0)\nBoth currently inactive with no ingredients\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied spaces\n- Before placing an entity, verify the target location is clear of other entities\n- The attempt to place burner inserter at (23.0, 20.5) failed because another entity was occupying that space\n- Consider checking surrounding tiles for available space before placement\n\n### Furnace efficiency issues\n- Multiple furnaces are idle due to lack of ingredients despite having fuel\n- Ensure proper connection between input inserters and material supply\n- Verify inserter pickup and drop positions align with furnace input positions\n\n### Resource management\n- Some mining drills are running low on fuel (as low as 1 coal)\n- Implement a fuel management system to keep mining operations running continuously\n- Consider setting up automated fuel insertion for mining drills and inserters"}
