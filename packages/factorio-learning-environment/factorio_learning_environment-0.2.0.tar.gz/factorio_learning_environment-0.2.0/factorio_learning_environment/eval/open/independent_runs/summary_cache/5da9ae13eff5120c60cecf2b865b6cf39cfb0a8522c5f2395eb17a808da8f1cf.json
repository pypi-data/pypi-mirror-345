Position(8.5, 22.5)) remains entirely obstructed.\n  \u2013 Mitigation strategies include a thorough manual inspection of the boiler area, removal or repositioning of conflicting entities, and/or relocating the extra steam engine to a less congested zone. Alternatively, modifying the boiler layout to improve clearance for connections is advisable.\n\n\u2022 Persistent \u201cOut of Fuel\u201d Warnings\n  \u2013 Multiple burner\u2011inserters and mining drills are consistently signaling an \u201cout of fuel\u201d status.\n  \u2013 Regular refueling routines should be instituted to maintain uninterrupted operation.\n\n\u2022 Generator Connection and Fluid Input Issues\n  \u2013 Numerous steam engines raise warnings such as \u201cnot connected to power network\u201d and \u201cno input liquid.\u201d\n  \u2013 Verification of proper power, fluid, and connection point alignments is essential to achieve full operational status.\n\n\u2022 Lab Power Deficiency\n  \u2013 The Automation Research Lab remains without power.\n  \u2013 Ensure that the lab\u2019s electrical links are rechecked and integrated into the network to deliver the necessary energy.\n\n(All reported errors reflect recurring issues observed in the latest diagnostic steps.)"}
