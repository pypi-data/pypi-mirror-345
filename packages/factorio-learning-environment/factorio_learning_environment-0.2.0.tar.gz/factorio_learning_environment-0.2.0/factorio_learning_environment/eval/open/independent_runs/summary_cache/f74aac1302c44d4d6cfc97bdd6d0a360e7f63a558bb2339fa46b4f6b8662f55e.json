{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n###Coal Mining and Processing Setup (around x=41-46, y=-80 to -82)\nComplex structure consisting of:\n- Burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0) mining coal\n- Wooden chest at (41.5, -80.5) collecting coal\n- First burner inserter at (42.5, -80.5) moving coal from chest to belt\n- Transport belt at (43.5, -80.5) moving right\n- Second burner inserter at (44.5, -80.5) moving items from belt to furnace\n- Stone furnace at (46.0, -80.0)\n\nERROR TIPS\n1. Furnace Placement Issues\n- Ensure target location is clear before placing furnace\n- Check for terrain compatibility (avoid water) when placing structures\n- Verify exact coordinates for placement to avoid overlap with existing entities\n\n2. Belt Blockage Issues\n- Regularly clear blocked resources from belts to maintain flow\n- Monitor belt status and clear blockages when inserters indicate destination is blocked\n\n3. Chest Capacity Issues\n- Monitor chest capacity to prevent overflow\n- Consider implementing logic to handle full chest conditions\n\n4. Entity Alignment\n- Pay attention to proper alignment between inserters and their target entities\n- Verify pickup and drop positions match intended workflow\n- Ensure inserter rotation matches required material flow direction\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nFunctions:\n- place_entity(): Places entities on the map\n  Success: When placement location is clear and valid\n  Failure: When location is blocked or terrain is incompatible\n\nImportant Variables:\n- EntityStatus.WORKING: Indicates normal operation\n- EntityStatus.NO_INGREDIENTS: Indicates missing input materials\n- EntityStatus.WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS: Indicates input shortage\n- EntityStatus.WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION: Indicates output blockage\n- Direction.RIGHT/LEFT/UP/DOWN: Entity orientation values"}
