{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System at x=-4.5 y=16.0\nConsists of:\n- Steam engine at x=-4.5 y=12.5\n- Boiler with coal fuel at x=-4.5 y=16.0\n- Offshore pump at x=-3.5 y=27.5\n- Connected by pipe networks for water and steam (fluid systems 5870, 5878)\n- Electric poles network connecting power to assembling machines and other entities\n\n### Automation Science Pack Production at x=8.5 y=13.5\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine at x=8.5 y=13.5\n- Input chest for copper plates at x=6.5 y=14.5\n- Input chest for iron gear wheels at x=8.5 y=10.5\n- Output chest at x=11.5 y=13.5\n- Burner inserter for copper plates at x=6.5 y=13.5 (facing right)\n- Burner inserter for iron gear wheels at x=8.5 y=11.5 (facing down)\n- Burner inserter for output at x=10.5 y=13.5 (facing right)\n\n### Mining and Smelting Operations\nMultiple mining and smelting setups at various locations:\n1. Setup at x=-28.0 y=-61.0:\n- Burner mining drill\n- Wooden chest at x=-27.5 y=-59.5\n- Stone furnace at x=-25.0 y=-59.0\n- Connected by burner inserters\n- Output chest at x=-22.5 y=-58.5 containing iron and copper plates\n\n2. Setup at x=-18.0 y=-53.0:\n- Burner mining drill\n- Wooden chest at x=-17.5 y=-51.5\n- Stone furnace at x=-15.0 y=-51.0\n- Output chest at x=-12.5 y=-50.5 containing iron plates\n- Connected by burner inserters\n\n3. Coal mining setup at x=41.0 y=-82.0:\n- Burner mining drill\n- Output chest at x=41.5 y=-80.5 containing coal\n- Burner inserter at x=41.5 y=-79.5\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Power Connection Issues\n- Ensure all machines requiring electricity are connected to the power network through electric poles\n- Check if power generation is active by verifying boiler has fuel and water supply\n\n### Inserter Configuration Issues\n- When placing inserters, explicitly specify both pickup and drop positions\n- Ensure inserter rotation matches the intended material flow direction\n- Verify inserter fuel levels before operation\n\n### Resource Management\n- Verify required materials are available in input chests before expecting production\n- Keep track of fuel levels in burner-type entities to prevent work stoppage\n\n### Entity Placement\n- Check space availability before placing new entities\n- Ensure connected entities (like inserters and chests) are properly aligned for material transfer\n\n### Production Line Setup\n- Verify all components of a production line are properly connected and powered before expecting output\n- Ensure correct recipe ingredients are available in the right quantities"}
