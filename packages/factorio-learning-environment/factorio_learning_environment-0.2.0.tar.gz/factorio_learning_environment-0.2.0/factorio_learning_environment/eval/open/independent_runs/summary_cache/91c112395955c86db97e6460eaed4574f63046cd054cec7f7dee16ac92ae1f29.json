{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper plate factory at position(2, 0)\nConsists of following entities\n- Furnace (position (2.0, 0.0)) that produces copper plates\n- Furnace (position (0.0, 0.0)) that produces iron plates\n- Chest (position (3.5, 0.5)) for storing copper plates\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when crafting automation science packs\n- Ensure you have enough copper plates and iron plates available in your inventory or accessible through furnaces before attempting to craft automation science packs. The recipe requires both copper plates and iron gear wheels, which in turn require iron plates.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
