{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Positions (61.0, -54.0) and (64.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (61.0, -54.0) with a coal supply and iron ore input, currently producing iron plates.\n- Furnace at position (64.0, -53.0) with a coal supply and iron ore input, currently producing iron plates.\n\n### Coal Transfer and Storage System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest at position (40.5, -83.5) containing coal.\n- Wooden chest at position (42.5, -83.5) containing coal.\n- Burner mining drill at position (41.0, -82.0) extracting coal, with a drop position at (40.5, -83.5).\n- Burner inserter at position (41.5, -83.5) transferring coal between chests.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Extracting Items from Furnaces\n- Ensure the furnace has enough items to extract before attempting to extract. Check the furnace's inventory to confirm the quantity available.\n\n### Errors when Using Extracting but Being Too Far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when Placing into a Tile Which is Occupied by Another Entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Defined Utility Functions\n- `extract_item`: Attempts to extract a specified quantity of an item from a given entity. Ensure the target entity has sufficient items before invoking this function to avoid extraction errors.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `extracted_plates_2`: Intended to store the result of extracting iron plates from a furnace. Ensure the furnace has the required quantity of iron plates before assigning to this variable."}
