{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nNo structures have been successfully created on the map. All attempts to place entities such as Burner Mining Drills, Stone Furnaces, and other components have failed, resulting in no existing structures.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied or invalid locations\n- Ensure that the target location is free and suitable for placing the desired entity. Check for any obstructions or invalid tiles before attempting to place entities like Burner Mining Drills, Stone Furnaces, and Wooden Chests.\n\n### Errors due to incorrect BuildingBox size\n- When attempting to place a Burner Mining Drill, ensure that the BuildingBox size is appropriate for the available space. Consider reducing the BuildingBox size or using multiple smaller BuildingBoxes if no viable space is found near the intended position.\n\n### Errors with missing entities\n- Verify the presence of required entities like Stone Furnaces on the map before attempting operations that depend on them. Ensure that the entities are correctly placed and accessible.\n\n### Errors related to setup not producing expected outputs\n- Double-check the setup configuration to ensure that all components are correctly connected and operational. Verify that inputs and outputs are correctly aligned to produce the desired items, such as iron plates.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items."}
