Ensure that the source items are available and that there are no blockages preventing the inserters from functioning.\n\n#### Chest Overflow Warning\n- The chest at position (-11.5, -49.5) is full, which is preventing the mining drill from continuing its operation. Regularly empty the chest to maintain continuous mining operations.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - None defined in the logs.\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `wooden-chest`: int = 3\n  - `wood`: int = 10\n  - `coal`: int = 655\n  - `iron-ore`: int = 987\n  - `iron-plate`: int = 1065"}
