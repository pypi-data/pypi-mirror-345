{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=22.5, y=-7.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (x=22.5, y=-7.5)\n- Boiler at Position (x=20.5, y=-4.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (x=19.5, y=-1.5)\n- Pipe Network connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility at Position (x=2.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=2.0, y=0.0)\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility at Position (x=5.0, y=5.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=5.0, y=5.0)\n\n### Inserter and Wooden Chest System\nConsists of:\n- Inserter at Position (x=-3.5, y=1.5)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (x=-3.5, y=0.5)\n- Connected via Small Electric Poles\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- PipeGroup for Steam at Position (x=21.5, y=-10.5)\n- PipeGroup for Water at Position (x=5.5, y=-8.5)\n- PipeGroup for Water at Position (x=18.5, y=-3.5)\n\n### Electricity Network\n- Small Electric Poles forming an ElectricityGroup with various positions, including (x=-2.5, y=-3.5) and (x=2.5, y=3.5)\n\n### Lab\n- Lab at an unspecified position, currently missing science packs for research\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Supplying Resources\n- Ensure you have the required resources in your inventory before attempting to supply them to an entity. For example, attempting to insert copper ore without having it in the inventory resulted in an error.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
