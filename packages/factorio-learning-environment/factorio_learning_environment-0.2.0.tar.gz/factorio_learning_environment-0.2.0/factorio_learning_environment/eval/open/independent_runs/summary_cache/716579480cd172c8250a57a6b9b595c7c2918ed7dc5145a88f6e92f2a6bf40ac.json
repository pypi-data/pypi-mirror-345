{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Two Wooden Chests at positions (-14.5, -48.5) and (-15.5, -48.5) for temporary storage.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -48.5) transferring iron ore from the chests to the furnaces.\n- Stone Furnace 1 at position (-12.0, -48.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Stone Furnace 2 at position (-10.0, -48.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Multiple Wooden Chests for storing iron plates at positions (-6.5, -49.5), (-6.5, -48.5), (-7.5, -48.5), and (-5.5, -48.5).\n\n### Iron Ore Storage and Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -46.5) storing extracted iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-14.5, -47.5) transferring iron ore from the storage chest to the furnaces.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chests at positions (-6.5, -49.5) and (-6.5, -48.5) storing iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-7.5, -47.5) for additional storage.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-8.5, -47.5) transferring iron plates between storage chests.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using undefined variables\n- Ensure all variables are defined before use. For example, the error \"NameError: name 'additional_storage_chest' is not defined\" suggests that the variable was referenced before being assigned. Double-check variable names and ensure they are correctly initialized.\n\n### Errors when inserting into full storage\n- Before inserting items into a storage entity, check if there is enough space. The error \"Could not insert: Failed to insert iron-plate into wooden-chest... Inventory is full\" indicates that the target chest was already at capacity. Consider expanding storage capacity or redistributing items to prevent overflow.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that inserters have access to source items. The warning \"inserter waiting for source items\" suggests that the inserter is idle due to lack of input. Verify that the supply chain is uninterrupted and that source items are available.\n\n### Furnace Output Blocked\n- Regularly check furnace outputs to prevent blockages. The warning \"furnace result is full\" indicates that the output slot is full, halting production. Regularly extract items from the furnace output to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Space in Destination\n- Ensure that the destination for inserter operations has available space. The warning \"furnace belt at drop position is blocked\" suggests that the destination is full or obstructed. Regularly clear destination slots to maintain flow."}
