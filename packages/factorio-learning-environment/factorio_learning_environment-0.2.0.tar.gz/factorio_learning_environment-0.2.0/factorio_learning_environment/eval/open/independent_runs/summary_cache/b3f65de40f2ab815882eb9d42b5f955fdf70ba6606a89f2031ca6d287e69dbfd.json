{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0) with a drop position at (x=-16.5, y=-52.5), extracting iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0) with a warning of 'no ingredients to smelt', indicating it is not currently active.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied or invalid locations\n- Ensure the target location is free and valid before attempting to place an entity such as a Wooden Chest, Burner Inserter, or Transport Belt. This will prevent placement errors like \"Cannot place Wooden Chest at the new location.\"\n\n### Errors when moving entities to invalid locations\n- Verify that the destination location is valid and unoccupied before moving entities like the Stone Furnace. This will prevent errors such as \"Cannot move the Stone Furnace to the new location.\"\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities from incorrect positions\n- Confirm the existence of an entity at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it. This will avoid errors like \"Could not get Prototype.StoneFurnace at position x=-16.5 y=-54.0.\"\n\n### Errors due to missing ingredients in production facilities\n- Ensure that production facilities like the Stone Furnace have the necessary ingredients to operate, preventing warnings such as 'no ingredients to smelt'."}
