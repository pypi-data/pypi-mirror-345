{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-11.5, 18.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam engine at position(-11.5, 18.5)\n- Boiler at position(-11.5, 25.0)\n- Offshore pump at position(-9.5, 24.5)\n- Connected pipes forming a network between the steam engine, boiler, and offshore pump.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(0, 0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at position(0.0, 0.0) and a furnace at position(0.0, 0.0)\n- Burner mining drill at position(5.0, 5.0) and a furnace at position(5.0, 5.0)\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine at position(z1) and inserter at position(a) that puts into assembling machine\n- Beltgroup (position) that connects the furnace at position(y1) to assembling machine at position(z1)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting boiler to water source\n- Ensure that there are no placement blockages when attempting to connect pipes. Check the surrounding area for any entities that may obstruct the connection.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
