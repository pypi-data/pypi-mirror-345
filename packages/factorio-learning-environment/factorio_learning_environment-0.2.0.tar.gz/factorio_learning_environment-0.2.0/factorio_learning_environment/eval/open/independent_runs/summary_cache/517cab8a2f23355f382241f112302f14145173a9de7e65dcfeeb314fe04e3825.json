{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, -60.0) with a drop position at (4.5, -58.5). It is currently fueled by coal and mining iron ore. The drill is connected to a **Wooden Chest** at position (4.5, -58.5) which stores the mined iron ore.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (-15.0, -48.0), (-13.0, -48.0), and (-11.0, -48.0). These furnaces are fueled by coal and are used for smelting iron ore into iron plates. Each furnace has a corresponding **Wooden Chest** at positions (-14.5, -50.5), (-13.5, -50.5), and (-12.5, -50.5) for storing the smelted iron plates.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Multiple **Wooden Chests** at positions (-11.5, -50.5), (-10.5, -50.5), (-9.5, -50.5), (-8.5, -50.5), and (-7.5, -50.5) for storing iron plates. Some of these chests are currently full.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Insufficient Resources for Operations\n- Ensure that there is enough coal in the inventory to refuel the burner mining drill. Without fuel, the drill will not operate.\n- Maintain a sufficient supply of iron ore in the inventory to distribute to the furnaces. Lack of iron ore will halt the smelting process.\n\n### Full Inventory Warnings\n- Regularly check and empty the chests at drop positions to prevent mining operations from stopping due to full storage.\n- Monitor the storage chests for iron plates to prevent overflow and ensure continuous production.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions**: None defined.\n- **Variables**:\n  - `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the current inventory of resources such as wood, iron ore, iron plates, and iron gear wheels."}
