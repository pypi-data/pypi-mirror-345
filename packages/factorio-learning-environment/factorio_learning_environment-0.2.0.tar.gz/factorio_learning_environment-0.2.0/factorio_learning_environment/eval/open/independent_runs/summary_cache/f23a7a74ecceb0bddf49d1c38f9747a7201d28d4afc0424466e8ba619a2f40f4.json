{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nThis facility is designed to produce iron plates from iron ore. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-16.0, -51.0): This drill extracts iron ore and is currently fueled with coal. It has a warning indicating that the output is blocked by an item on the ground, and there is no sink entity to accept the output.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-14.0, -49.0): This furnace is intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates. It is currently fueled with coal but has a warning indicating no ingredients to smelt, which means the setup needs adjustment to ensure continuous production.\n\n### Storage Facility\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-22.5, -51.5): This chest is placed to store items, but its current inventory is empty.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied or invalid locations\n- Ensure the target location is free and suitable for placing entities like Wooden Chests, Burner Inserters, and Transport Belts. This will prevent placement errors.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient inventory\n- Before attempting to place entities like burner-mining-drills, verify that the required items are available in the inventory to avoid placement failures.\n\n### Errors when output is blocked\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity, such as a chest or belt, to accept the output from drills to prevent blockage warnings and ensure smooth operation.\n\n### Errors with furnace setup\n- Verify that the furnace has the necessary ingredients to smelt. Ensure that iron ore is being correctly delivered to the furnace to maintain production of iron plates."}
