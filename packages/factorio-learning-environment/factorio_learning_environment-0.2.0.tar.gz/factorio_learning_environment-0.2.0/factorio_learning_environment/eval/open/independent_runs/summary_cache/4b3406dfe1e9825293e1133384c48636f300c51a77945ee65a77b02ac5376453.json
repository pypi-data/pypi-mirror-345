For example, avoid attempting to call a 'Chest' object as if it were a function. Use appropriate methods to interact with objects.\n\n### Errors when adjusting inserter drop positions\n- Double-check the inserter's drop position to ensure it aligns correctly with the intended target. Misalignment can lead to inefficiencies or stoppages in production."}
