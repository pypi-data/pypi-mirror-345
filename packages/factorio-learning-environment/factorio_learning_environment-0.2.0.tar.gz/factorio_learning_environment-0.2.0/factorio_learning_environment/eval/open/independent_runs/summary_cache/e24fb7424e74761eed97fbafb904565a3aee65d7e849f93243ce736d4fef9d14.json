{"content": "Based on the provided logs, I'll generate a comprehensive report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Setup at (-15.0, -50.0)\n- Burner mining drill positioned at (-15.0, -50.0)\n- Wooden chest at (-13.5, -50.5)\n- Two burner inserters:\n  - One at (-14.5, -51.5) moving items from chest to drill\n  - One at (-12.5, -50.5) moving items from chest to transport belt\n\n### Coal Mining Setup at (38.0, -83.0)\n- Burner mining drill at (38.0, -83.0)\n- Wooden chest at (39.5, -83.5) containing coal\n- Burner inserter at (40.5, -83.5) moving coal from chest to belt\n- Additional chest-inserter pair at (41.5, -86.5) and (40.5, -86.5)\n\n### Smelting Setup at (45.0, -80.0)\n- Two stone furnaces at (45.0, -80.0) and (47.0, -80.0)\n- Two storage chests:\n  - At (49.5, -80.5) containing coal\n  - At (49.5, -79.5) containing coal and iron plates\n- Complex belt system connecting mining operations to furnaces\n  - Multiple belt groups handling coal and iron ore transport\n  - Belt connections at various positions including (43.5, -81.5), (48.5, -81.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Conflicts\n- Before placing entities, check if the target location is clear of other entities\n- Common error when trying to place burner-inserters and transport belts at occupied positions\n- Particularly problematic at positions (48.5, -81.5), (44.5, -81.5), (44.5, -80.5)\n\n### Belt Connection Issues\n- Ensure there is a valid path when trying to connect transport belts\n- Error seen when attempting to connect transport belts from (43.5, -81.5) to (48.5, -81.5)\n\n### Resource Management\n- Multiple entities showing \"out of fuel\" warnings\n- Ensure consistent fuel supply to burner mining drills\n- Monitor chest capacity - some chests are reaching full capacity (e.g., chest at 49.5, -80.5)\n\nNAMESPACE\n\n### Variables\n- input_inserter1, input_inserter2: BurnerInserter\n- belt: TransportBelt\n\n### Functions\n- place_entity(): Places entities at specified coordinates\n- connect_entities(): Connects compatible entities like transport belts\n- Success: When placement locations are clear\n- Failure: When target locations are occupied or invalid connections attempted"}
