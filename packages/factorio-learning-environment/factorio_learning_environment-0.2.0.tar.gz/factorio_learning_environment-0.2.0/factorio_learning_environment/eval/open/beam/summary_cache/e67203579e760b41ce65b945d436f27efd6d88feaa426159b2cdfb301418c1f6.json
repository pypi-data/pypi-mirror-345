Monitor both furnaces as they continue processing their iron ore.\n2. Gather more iron ore if necessary once they finish processing or if production starts slowing down.\n\nLet\u2019s wait briefly to check how many iron plates are produced by both furnaces after a short period.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Wait for a specified amount of time to allow the furnaces to process their iron ore\nsleep(10)  # Adjust this duration if needed\n\n# Check the inventory and entity status after waiting\nprint(f\"Inventory after waiting for production: {inspect_inventory()}\")\nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")", "summary_range": "[1-124]"}
