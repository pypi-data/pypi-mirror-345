{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Setup at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nThis setup is designed to extract iron ore and smelt it into iron plates. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore from the resource patch.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Temporarily stores extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0): Smelts iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Alignment and Functionality\n- Ensure that inserters are correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items between entities. Misalignment can cause the inserter to not function properly, leading to resources not being transferred as expected.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Iron Ore\n- Verify that the inserter is correctly configured and has a clear path to transfer iron ore from the chest to the furnace. Check for any obstructions or misalignments that may prevent the inserter from operating efficiently.\n\n### Chest Management\n- Regularly check the chest's inventory to prevent it from becoming full, which can halt mining operations. Extract items from the chest as needed to maintain space for incoming resources.\n\n### Refueling\n- Keep all fuel-dependent entities, such as the burner mining drill, furnace, and inserter, adequately refueled with coal to ensure continuous operation."}
