{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-13.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0)\n- Burner Inserter at position (-14.5, -46.5)\n\nThis structure is responsible for extracting iron ore, storing it in a chest, and then smelting it into iron plates using a stone furnace. The burner inserter is used to transfer iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n\n### Coal Production Facility at Position (43.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -80.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (43.0, -82.0)\n- Burner Inserter at position (43.5, -80.5)\n\nThis structure is responsible for extracting coal, storing it in a chest, and then using it to fuel a stone furnace. The burner inserter is used to transfer coal from the chest to the furnace.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items without sufficient inventory\n- Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into a structure. For example, attempting to insert coal into a furnace without having coal in the inventory will result in an error.\n\n### Errors when chests are full\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are full to allow continuous operation of mining drills. For example, the chest at position (41.5, -80.5) and (-14.5, -48.5) need to be emptied to continue mining operations.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into a furnace without required ingredients\n- Ensure that the furnace has the necessary ingredients to smelt before inserting fuel. For example, inserting coal into a furnace without iron ore will not result in any smelting."}
