In this case, iron-plate is needed to craft iron-gear-wheel, which is needed to craft automation-science-pack.\n- Make sure you have the necessary machines to craft the items. The error message indicates that iron-plate requires a crafting machine or smelting in a furnace.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into entities\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into an entity. The error message indicates that there was no iron-ore in the inventory when attempting to insert it into the stone furnace.\n\n# NAMESPACE\n### Utility Functions:\nNone\n\n### Variables:\nNone\n```"}
