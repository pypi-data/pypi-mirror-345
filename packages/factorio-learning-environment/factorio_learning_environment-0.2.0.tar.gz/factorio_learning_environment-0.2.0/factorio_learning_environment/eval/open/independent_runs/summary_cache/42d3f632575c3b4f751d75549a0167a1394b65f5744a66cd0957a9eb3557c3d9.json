{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Steam power generation setup at position(-11.5, 25.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Boiler at position (-11.5, 25.0) connected to an offshore pump at position (-9.5, 24.5) via pipes.\n- Steam engine at position (-11.5, 18.5) connected to the boiler for power generation.\n- Multiple pipes connecting the boiler and steam engine, including:\n  - Pipe at position (-12.5, 15.5)\n  - Pipe at position (-13.5, 15.5)\n  - Pipe at position (-13.5, 20.5)\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(x)\nConsists of following entities\n- Burner mining drill (position x1) and a furnace at position(y1)\n- Burner mining drill (position x2) and a furnace at position(y2)\n- Burner mining drill (position x3) and a furnace at position(y3)\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of following entities\n- Burner mining drill (position x1) and a furnace at position(y1)\n- Assembling machine at position(z1) and inserter at position(a) that puts into assembling machine\n- Beltgroup (position ) that connects the furnace at position y1 to assembling machine at position(z1)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting pipes\n- Ensure that there are no placement blockages when attempting to connect pipes. Check the surrounding area for any entities that may obstruct the connection.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
