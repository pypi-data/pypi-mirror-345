{"content": "Based on the current inventory and crafting results, it seems that we're missing enough copper cables to craft electronic circuits, which in turn prevents us from crafting the Offshore Pump. Here's a step-by-step plan to resolve this:\n\n### Step 1: Craft More Copper Cables\nYou need more copper cables to craft electronic circuits. Let's ensure you have enough copper plates and then craft additional copper cables.\n\n1. **Check Copper Plate Inventory**: You have 4 copper plates. You can craft more copper cables using these plates.\n2. **Craft Copper Cables**: Each copper plate can be used to craft 2 copper cables.\n\n```python\n# Craft additional copper cables\ncopper_cables_needed = 3  # You need at least 3 copper cables for one electronic circuit\ncopper_plates_available = inventory.get(Prototype.CopperPlate, 0)\n\nif copper_plates_available > 0:\n    copper_cables_to_craft = min(copper_plates_available, copper_cables_needed)\n    crafted_cables = craft_item(Prototype.CopperCable, copper_cables_to_craft)\n    print(f\"Crafted {crafted_cables} additional copper cables.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Not enough copper plates to craft more copper cables.\")\n```\n\n### Step 2: Craft Electronic Circuits\nOnce you have enough copper cables, you can proceed to craft electronic circuits.\n\n```python\n# Check if you now have enough copper cables and iron plates\ninventory = inspect_inventory()\ncopper_cables = inventory.get(Prototype.CopperCable, 0)\niron_plates = inventory.get(Prototype.IronPlate, 0)\n\nif copper_cables >= 3 and iron_plates >= 1:\n    crafted_circuits = craft_item(Prototype.ElectronicCircuit, 1)\n    print(f\"Crafted {crafted_circuits} electronic circuit(s).\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Still not enough materials to craft electronic circuits.\")\n```\n\n### Step 3: Craft the Offshore Pump\nWith electronic circuits available, you can now craft the Offshore Pump.\n\n```python\n# Attempt to craft the Offshore Pump\ninventory = inspect_inventory()\nif inventory.get(Prototype.ElectronicCircuit, 0) > 0:\n    crafted_pumps = craft_item(Prototype.OffshorePump, 1)\n    if crafted_pumps:\n        print(f\"Successfully crafted {crafted_pumps} Offshore Pump(s).\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Unable to craft Offshore Pump due to insufficient electronic circuits.\")\n```\n\n### Step 4: Continue with Setup\nOnce the Offshore Pump is crafted, proceed with placing and connecting it, along with other components like the Boiler, Steam Engine, and Small Electric Pole, as previously outlined.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the resource bottleneck and proceed with your setup.", "summary_range": "[1-318]"}
