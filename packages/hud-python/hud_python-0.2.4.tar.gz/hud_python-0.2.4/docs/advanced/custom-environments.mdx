# Custom Environments

While the HUD SDK provides standard environments like `"hud-browser"` and `"OSWorld-Ubuntu"`, you can also define and run your own custom environments using Docker. This allows you to create specific testing scenarios with custom software stacks or configurations.

Custom environments are defined using the `CustomGym` type from `hud.types`.

## Defining a Custom Environment (`CustomGym`)

```python
from hud.types import CustomGym
from pathlib import Path

# Example 1: Local Docker environment using a source directory
# Points to a directory containing controller code and a Dockerfile
local_env_spec = CustomGym(
    location="local",
    controller_source_dir="./my_custom_controller" # Path to your controller code
)

# Example 2: Remote Docker environment (built and run on HUD platform)
remote_env_spec = CustomGym(
    location="remote",
    # Dockerfile content is sent to HUD to build the image remotely
    dockerfile="FROM ubuntu:latest\nRUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y my-package\n..."
)
```

**Key `CustomGym` Attributes:**

*   **`location` (`"local"` | `"remote"`):**
    *   `"local"`: Builds and runs the Docker container on your *local* machine. Requires Docker installed. Ideal for development. See [Local Environment Structure](#local-environment-structure) below.
    *   `"remote"`: Sends the `dockerfile` content to the HUD platform for remote build and execution. Good for sharing or running complex setups.
*   **`dockerfile` (str | None):** The Dockerfile content.
    *   Required if `location="remote"`.
    *   Optional if `location="local"` and `controller_source_dir` is provided (will look for `Dockerfile` inside that directory).
*   **`controller_source_dir` (str | `Path` | None):**
    *   *Only relevant for `location="local"`.*
    *   Path to your local directory containing the controller code and potentially the `Dockerfile`. This directory is mounted into the container.

## <a name="local-environment-structure"></a>Local Environment Structure

When creating a `local` custom environment, the directory specified by `controller_source_dir` typically contains:

1.  **`Dockerfile`:** Defines the base image, system dependencies, Python dependencies (often via `pip install -e .`), and the command to run your controller script (`CMD [...]`).
2.  **`pyproject.toml`:** Defines your controller as an installable Python package. The HUD SDK reads the `[project.name]` from this file to know how to import your controller code within the container after installation.
3.  **`src/` (or your package name):** A directory containing your Python controller code. This code needs to implement the functions called by `setup`, `evaluate`, and `step` (e.g., interacting with applications inside the container, returning observations).

**Example Structure (`./my_custom_controller/`):**

```
my_custom_controller/
├── Dockerfile
├── pyproject.toml
└── src/
    └── my_controller_pkg/
        ├── __init__.py
        └── main.py        # Your controller logic (e.g., setup, step functions)
```

*   **Examples:** The top-level `environments/` directory in the SDK repository contains reference implementations (like `novnc_ubuntu`) following this structure.
*   **Dependencies:** For local custom environments, you might need to install development dependencies using `pip install -e ".[dev]"` in your SDK checkout to ensure the local components (like the Docker client) function correctly.

## Using a Custom Environment

Use your `CustomGym` object with `hud.gym.make()`:

```python
from hud import gym
from hud.types import CustomGym

# Assuming local_env_spec = CustomGym(location="local", controller_source_dir="./my_custom_controller")
env = await gym.make(local_env_spec)

print("Custom local environment created.")

# Interact as usual - Task setup/evaluate calls functions in your controller
# task = Task(prompt="...", gym=local_env_spec, setup=("my_setup_func", arg1), ...)
# env = await gym.make(task)
# obs, _ = await env.reset()
# result = await env.evaluate()

await env.close()
```

Creating a custom environment requires careful design of both the Dockerfile and the controller script to ensure they work together correctly.
