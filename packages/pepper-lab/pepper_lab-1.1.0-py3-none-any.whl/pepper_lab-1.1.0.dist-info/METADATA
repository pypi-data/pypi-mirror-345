# PEPPER - Predict Environmental Pollutant PERsistence

PEPPER is a package developed by the Fenner Labs for analyzing and modeling persistence of micropollutants in different environments.

## Installation 

The PEPPER library may be installed using:
```
pip install pepper-lab
```


## Projects
Follow these steps to reproduce the workflows and results from previous publications:

Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/FennerLabs/pepper
cd pepper
```

Fetch the files from github
```
git lfs fetch --all
git lfs pull
```

We also recommend creating a dedicated virtual environment with python 3.12 as base 

```
python -m venv pepper_env
source pepper_env/bin/activate
```

We have included all requirements in the pyproject.toml file so all dependencies may be installed as follows

``` 
pip install .
```


### Bayesian inference for soil biotransformation half-lives - Hafner et al., 2023
Here's how to reproduce the data and the figures from the publication:
```
cd scripts
python bayesian_inference_main.py
```

### Current Opportunities and Limitations in Predicting Micropollutant Removal in Wastewater Treatment based on Molecular Structure - Cordero et al., 2025
In this project we include methods to model the breakthrough of micropollutants in wastewater treatment plants.
Main results can be reproduced as follows:
```
cd scripts
predict_breakthrough_wwtp.py
```

Please refer to the main publication for further details
