{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entity:\n- Stone Furnace used for smelting iron ore by inserting coal and ore. Initially positioned at (-15.0, -50.0), it has undergone additional operations: an adjacent iron ore patch was found at (-15.5, -50.5) and extra ore was inserted, followed by an insertion of additional coal to boost smelting. The furnace reached a state where 10 iron plates were successfully produced and subsequently extracted.\n\nERROR TIPS\n### Insufficient Production and Process Delays in Smelting\n- When the furnace produces fewer iron plates than expected, ensure that both fuel and ore are supplied adequately. Boost smelting by adding extra fuel (e.g., coal) when production is lagging.\n- Check that the production interval is appropriate to allow the furnace to complete its smelting cycle before inventory checks are made.\n- Monitor the furnace status warnings (e.g., \"no ingredients to smelt\") to adjust inputs and avoid process timeouts."}
