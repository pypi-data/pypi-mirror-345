Multiple attempts were made to supply a Lab at position (0.5, 2.5), but placement failed due to missing items in the inventory. Although furnace entities (an alternative furnace at Position(x=5.0, y=5.0) and a copper furnace at Position(x=-27.0, y=-60.0)) were retrieved for smelting processes, they appear to be pre\u2010existing and were not created by the agent in these steps.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 API Usage Errors with get_entities  \n  \u2013 When calling get_entities, avoid passing unexpected keyword arguments (e.g., \u201cradius\u201d) or unsupported positional parameters. Adhere to its defined signature to prevent argument-related TypeErrors.\n\n\u2022 Entity Placement Failures  \n  \u2013 Before attempting to place a structure (such as the Lab), confirm that the required entity exists in the inventory and that the target position is valid. Lack of inventory leads to placement errors.\n\n\u2022 Iteration on Null Results  \n  \u2013 Check that functions returning collections (like get_entities) do not return None before iterating over their results. Using a fallback (such as an empty list) helps prevent \u201cNoneType\u201d iteration errors.\n\n\u2022 Incomplete Crafting Chain and Missing Sub-ingredients  \n  \u2013 Ensure that all prerequisite resources and production capabilities are in place. Failures in crafting the Lab indicate missing sub-ingredients (for example, iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, and copper-cables) due to an incomplete supply chain (e.g., insufficient iron-plates or copper-plates and missing production machines for smelting or assembling).  \n  \u2013 Reconcile recipe requirements with available resources and verify that each stage in the production chain is operational before reattempting complex crafts."}
