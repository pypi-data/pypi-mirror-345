{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Smelting Line\nA complex smelting setup consisting of:\n- 4 Stone furnaces at positions (0.0, 0.0), (2.0, 0.0), (4.0, 0.0), and (6.0, 0.0)\n- Input chests at (0.5, -2.5), (2.5, -2.5), (4.5, -2.5), and (6.5, -2.5) containing coal and iron plates\n- Burner inserters at (0.5, -1.5), (2.5, -1.5), (4.5, -1.5), and (6.5, -1.5) moving items from input chests to furnaces\n- Output collection system:\n  - Side output chest at (-2.5, 0.5) with burner inserter at (-1.5, 0.5) collecting from first furnace\n  - Output chests at (2.5, 1.5), (4.5, 1.5), and (6.5, 1.5)\n  - Transfer inserters at (0.5, 1.5), (1.5, 1.5), (3.5, 1.5), and (5.5, 1.5) moving items between furnaces and output chests\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when attempting to pick up non-existent items\n- Before attempting to pick up items, verify they exist at the target location\n- Error example: Attempting to pick up iron ore at (0.5, -0.5) when none was present\n\n### Furnace operation optimization\n- Furnaces showing \"no ingredients to smelt\" warning\n- Ensure consistent supply of raw materials to keep furnaces operating continuously\n- Monitor and maintain proper input/output flow of materials"}
