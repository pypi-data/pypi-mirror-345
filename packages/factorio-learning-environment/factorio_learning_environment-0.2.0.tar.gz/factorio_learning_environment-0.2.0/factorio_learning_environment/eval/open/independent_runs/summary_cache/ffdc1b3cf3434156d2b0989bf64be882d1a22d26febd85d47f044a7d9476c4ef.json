{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -49.0) used for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Mining and Transfer System at Position (40.0, -84.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (40.0, -84.0) extracting resources.\n- Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -83.5) for storing extracted resources.\n- Burner Inserter at position (41.5, -80.5) transferring items from the chest to another location.\n\n### Item Transfer System at Position (54.5, -83.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Inserter at position (54.5, -83.5) transferring items from a Wooden Chest at position (56.5, -83.5).\n\n### Conveyor Belt System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Belt Group connecting various positions, facilitating the movement of items across the system.\n  - Inputs: Belt from (50.5, -86.5) to (48.5, -86.5), direction LEFT.\n  - Outputs: Belt from (49.5, -86.5) to (47.5, -86.5), direction LEFT.\n  - Additional Belts: Belt from (43.5, -84.5) to (45.5, -84.5), direction RIGHT; Belt from (45.5, -85.5) to (47.5, -85.5), direction RIGHT; Belt from (52.5, -83.5) to (52.5, -85.5), direction UP.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items without sufficient inventory\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. For example, attempting to insert iron ore into a stone furnace without having iron ore in the inventory will result in an error.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
