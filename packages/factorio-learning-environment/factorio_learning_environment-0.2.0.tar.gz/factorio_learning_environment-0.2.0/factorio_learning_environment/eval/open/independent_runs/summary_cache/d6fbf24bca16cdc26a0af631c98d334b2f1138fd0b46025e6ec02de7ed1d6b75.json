It accepts coal as fuel and iron ore as input, with a recorded fuel reserve (e.g. {'coal': 6}). The furnace is part of the smelting setup designed to produce iron plates and has been the central structure in attempts to process inputs despite multiple smelting timeouts.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 Crafting prerequisite errors\n  - When crafting items, always verify that all required raw resources have been gathered. In this case, attempting to craft a stone furnace before obtaining sufficient stone led to a crafting failure. Ensure raw resources are available before initiating a craft process.\n\n\u2022 Smelting operation timeouts\n  - Persistent smelting timeout errors indicate insufficient or imbalanced fuel and input supply. Before initiating smelting or inserting additional inputs, confirm that the furnace has adequate fuel and proper quantities of inputs to initiate a complete smelting cycle.\n\n\u2022 Extraction operations with inadequate available output\n  - Extraction errors occur when attempting to extract items from a furnace with zero available output. Ensure that the furnace output is above zero before extraction to avoid attempting to extract non-existent items."}
