{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (22.5, -7.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (22.5, -7.5)\n- Boiler at position (20.5, -4.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (4.5, -10.5)\n- Pipe network connecting these components, with key positions including (20.5, -5.5), (22.5, -10.5), and (18.5, -3.5)\n- Small Electric Pole at position (24.5, -7.5) for power distribution\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with copper-plate output\n- Stone Furnace at position (2.0, 0.0) processing copper ore\n- Stone Furnace at position (5.0, 5.0) with iron-plate output\n\n### Research Lab\n- Lab with automation-science-pack input, located within the electricity network\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- PipeGroup at position (19.5, -12.5) handling steam\n- PipeGroup at position (4.5, -9.5) handling water\n- PipeGroup at position (18.5, -3.5) handling water\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors When Inserting Items into Furnaces\n- Ensure the correct type of ore is inserted into the furnace. A furnace containing copper ore cannot accept iron ore.\n- Check the furnace inventory capacity before inserting items. Avoid attempting to insert items if the inventory is full.\n\n### Errors When Furnace Inventory is Full\n- Regularly monitor and clear furnace outputs to prevent inventory overflow, ensuring continuous operation."}
