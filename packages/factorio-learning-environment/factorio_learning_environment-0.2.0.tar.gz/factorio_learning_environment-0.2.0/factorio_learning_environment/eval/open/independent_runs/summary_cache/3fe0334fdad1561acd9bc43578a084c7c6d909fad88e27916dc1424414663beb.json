{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nThis structure is designed for the production of iron plates from iron ore. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Responsible for extracting iron ore. It is currently fueled with coal and has a warning indicating the chest at the drop position is full.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore and iron plates. It currently contains 26 iron ore and 25 iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace. It is fueled with coal and is operational.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0): Smelts iron ore into iron plates. It is fueled with coal but currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Furnace Production\n- Ensure that the furnace has both coal and iron ore to produce iron plates. Regularly check the furnace inventory to prevent it from running out of ingredients.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Refueling\n- Maintain a sufficient supply of coal in the inventory to refuel the inserter. Monitor coal levels and harvest more coal before the inserter runs out of fuel.\n\n### Errors with Mining Drill Output\n- Regularly empty the chest at the mining drill's drop position to prevent it from becoming full. This will ensure continuous mining operations without interruptions."}
