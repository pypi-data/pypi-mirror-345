The error \"Not enough iron plates to craft another stone furnace\" indicates insufficient materials.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into furnaces\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into furnaces. The error \"Could not insert: No iron-ore to insert from your inventory\" suggests that the item is missing.\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure that the position you are trying to place an entity is not occupied by another entity. This can lead to placement failures.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items to avoid distance-related errors.\n\n### Errors when inserting fuel into furnaces\n- Make sure you have the appropriate fuel in your inventory before trying to insert it into the furnace. The error \"Could not insert: No coal to insert from your inventory\" indicates a lack of fuel."}
