{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Coal Mining Setup at Position(x=41.0, y=-82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner mining drill** at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0) for extracting coal.\n- **Wooden chest** at position (x=41.5, y=-80.5) for storing extracted coal.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when attempting to place entities on non-buildable tiles\n- Ensure the target tile is clear and buildable before attempting to place entities like stone furnaces or assembling machines. Check for obstructions or invalid terrain.\n\n#### Errors when trying to insert items into non-existent or incorrect entities\n- Verify the existence and type of the target entity before attempting to insert items. For example, ensure the furnace or drill exists and is within range.\n\n#### Errors when accessing undefined variables\n- Always define variables before using them. For example, ensure `assembler` is defined before referencing it in the code.\n\n#### Repeated errors when attempting to get non-existent entities\n- Before accessing an entity at a specific position, confirm its existence. Use appropriate checks to avoid errors when the entity is not found.\n\n#### Errors when inserting items into entities that cannot accept them\n- Ensure the target entity can accept the item being inserted. For example, furnaces can accept coal, but other entities may not."}
