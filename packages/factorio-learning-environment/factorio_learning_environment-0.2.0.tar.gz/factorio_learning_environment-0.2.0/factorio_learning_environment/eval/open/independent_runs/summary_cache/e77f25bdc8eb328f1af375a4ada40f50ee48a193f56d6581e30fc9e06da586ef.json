{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System at Various Positions\n- **Boilers**: Multiple boilers are placed at positions (-29.5, 20.0), (-24.5, 20.0), (-25.5, 22.0), (-17.5, 24.0), (-21.5, 27.0), (-24.5, 30.0), and (-28.5, 32.0). All boilers are currently not connected to any fluid system and have warnings indicating no input liquid and no fluid present in connections.\n- **Offshore Pumps**: Positioned at (-10.5, 25.5) and (-7.5, 25.5), both pumps are not connected to any fluid system.\n- **Steam Engine**: Located at (-32.5, 32.5), the steam engine is not connected to any power network or fluid system.\n\n### Smelting Facilities\n- **Furnaces**: Two stone furnaces are located at positions (0.0, 0.0) and (2.0, 0.0). Both are currently not smelting any ingredients and have warnings for no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Laboratory\n- **Lab**: Present but not powered, indicating a lack of connection to the power system.\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- **Pipe Groups**: Multiple pipe groups are present at various positions, such as (-18.5, 9.5), (-14.5, 13.5), (-4.5, 13.5), etc. All pipes are currently empty and not connected to any fluid systems.\n\n### Electricity Network\n- **Electricity Group**: Contains poles at various positions like (-0.5, -4.5), (-4.5, -4.5), etc., but the network has a voltage of 0, indicating no power flow.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Connecting Entities\n- Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to connect entities such as pipes, boilers, and steam engines. Check inventory for pipes and small electric poles before attempting connections.\n\n### Errors with Blocked Connection Points\n- When connecting boilers or steam engines, ensure that the connection points are not blocked by other entities. Rearrange entities if necessary to unblock connection points.\n\n### Insufficient Inventory\n- Keep track of your inventory to ensure you have enough materials for crafting and placing entities. For example, ensure you have enough pipes and small electric poles before attempting to connect systems.\n\n### Lab Not Powered\n- Ensure that the lab is connected to a power source. Craft and place small electric poles to connect the lab to the power system.\n\n### Crafting Errors\n- Gather necessary raw materials before crafting complex items. For instance, ensure you have enough stone to craft stone furnaces, which are required for crafting boilers.\n\n### Placement Errors\n- Verify that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to place entities like boilers."}
