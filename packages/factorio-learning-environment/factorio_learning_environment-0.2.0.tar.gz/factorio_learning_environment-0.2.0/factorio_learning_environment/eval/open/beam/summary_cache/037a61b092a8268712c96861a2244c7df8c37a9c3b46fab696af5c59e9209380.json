{"content": "It appears that I am facing a critical resource scarcity, as there are no iron ore, copper ore, or stone patches available in the vicinity of my current position. This situation severely limits my ability to craft items or build necessary infrastructure.\n\n### Summary of Attempts:\n1. **Iron Ore Search**: Attempted to locate iron ore patches but found none.\n2. **Copper Ore Search**: Searched for copper ore patches, which also yielded no results.\n3. **Stone Search**: Finally, I searched for stone resources, but again, no patches were found.\n\n### Tips and Logic Patterns to Avoid Future Errors:\n1. **Broaden Search Radius**: When searching for resources, consider increasing the search radius significantly to capture a larger area. This may help locate resources that are further away.\n  \n2. **Prioritize Resource Types**: If certain resources are critical for your immediate needs, prioritize searching for those first. For example, focus on iron ore if crafting machinery is essential.\n\n3. **Use Resource Maps**: If available, utilize resource maps or tools that can provide an overview of resource distribution in the area. This can save time and effort in locating necessary materials.\n\n4. **Explore New Areas**: If resources are scarce in the current location, consider moving to entirely new areas. Traveling further away may lead to discovering resource-rich zones.\n\n5. **Check Inventory Regularly**: Before embarking on resource searches, ensure that you have enough supplies to sustain exploration (e.g., food, tools) to avoid getting stranded.\n\n6. **Plan for Resource Scarcity**: Always have a backup plan for resource acquisition. This could involve setting up mobile mining operations or having a stockpile of essential items before venturing out.\n\n7. **Utilize Alternative Resources**: If traditional resources are unavailable, consider using alternative methods or resources that may not be immediately obvious (e.g., recycling existing structures).\n\nIn this case, I should consider moving to a new location entirely to search for resources, as the current area seems completely devoid of essential materials.", "summary_range": "[1-100]"}
