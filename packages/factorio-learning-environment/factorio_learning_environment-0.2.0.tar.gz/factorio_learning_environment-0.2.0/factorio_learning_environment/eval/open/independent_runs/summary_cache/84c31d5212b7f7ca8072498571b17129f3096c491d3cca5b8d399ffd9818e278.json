{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(12.928571428571429, 10.714285714285714)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Electricity group (position 12.928571428571429, 10.714285714285714) - Status: NOT_PLUGGED_IN_ELECTRIC_NETWORK\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(-28.5, -61.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position -28.5, -61.5) and a furnace at position(0.0, 0.0) - Status: NO_INGREDIENTS\n- Burner mining drill (position -28.5, -61.5) and a furnace at position(2.0, 0.0) - Status: WORKING\n- Burner mining drill (position -28.5, -61.5) and a furnace at position(2.0, 2.0) - Status: NO_INGREDIENTS\n\n### Lab at position(10.5, 10.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab (position 10.5, 10.5) - Status: NO_POWER\n\n### Wooden chest at position(5.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest (position 5.5, 0.5) - Status: NORMAL\n\n### Copper cable factory at position(0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine at position(0, 0) and inserter at position(0, 1) that puts into assembling machine\n- Beltgroup (position 0) that connects the furnace at position(0.0, 0.0) to the assembling machine at position(0, 0)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors related to entity retrieval\n- Verify the position and type of the entity you are trying to access. The error indicates that the lab could not be found at the specified position (6.0, 0.0). Ensure the entity exists at the intended coordinates before attempting to retrieve it.\n\n### Errors related to power supply\n- Check the power supply connections for entities that require electricity. Ensure that the electricity group is properly connected to the electric network to avoid the NO_POWER status."}
