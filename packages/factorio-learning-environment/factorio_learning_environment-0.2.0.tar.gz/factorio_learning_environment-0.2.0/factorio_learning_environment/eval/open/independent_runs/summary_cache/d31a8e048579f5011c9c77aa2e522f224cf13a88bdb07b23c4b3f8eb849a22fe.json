You need to add an inserter that inputs items into Prototype.SteamEngine and use the inserter as the target entity.\u201d  \n  \u2013 Tip: Always verify that the belt connection targets an appropriate inserter rather than a steam engine; adjust the target by adding or using an inserter to ensure correct linkage.\n\n\u2022 Entity Placement Distance Errors  \n  \u2013 Error Message: \u201cCould not place wooden-chest at (3.5,15.5), The target position is too far away\u2026 The player position is (0, 0) \u2026 Move closer.\u201d  \n  \u2013 Tip: Ensure that the player or placement cursor is within the allowed distance from the target before attempting to place an entity.\n\n\u2022 Undefined Variable Reference  \n  \u2013 Error Message: \u201cNameError: name \u2018target_chest\u2019 is not defined \u2026 Did you mean one of these?
