Consider increasing spacing, changing direction, or adjusting the reference position to avoid placement errors.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient inventory\n- Maintain an adequate supply of necessary resources (e.g., iron ore) in the inventory to ensure continuous operation of furnaces. Regularly check and replenish inventory levels to avoid interruptions in production.\n\n### Inserter waiting for source items\n- Ensure that source items are available for inserters to pick up. Regularly check and manage inventories to prevent inserters from idling due to lack of source items."}
