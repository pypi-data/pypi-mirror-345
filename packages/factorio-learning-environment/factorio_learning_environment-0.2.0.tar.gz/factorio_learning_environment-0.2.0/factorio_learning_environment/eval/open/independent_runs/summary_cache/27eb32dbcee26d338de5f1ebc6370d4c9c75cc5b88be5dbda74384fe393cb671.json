{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (10.5, 34.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (10.5, 34.5)\n- Boiler at position (5.5, 27.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (0.5, 30.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Furnace at position (15.0, 0.0)\n- Inserters at positions (17.5, 0.5) and (16.5, 0.5)\n- Wooden Chests at positions (5.5, 0.5) and (18.5, 0.5)\n\n### Fluid Transport System\nConsists of multiple PipeGroups connecting various positions:\n- PipeGroup at position (-14.5, 14.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (-14.5, 17.5) containing water\n- PipeGroup at position (-12.5, 18.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (-11.5, 19.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (-12.5, 21.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (-9.5, 23.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (-7.5, 24.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (-3.5, 24.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (-5.5, 26.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (1.5, 29.5) containing water\n- PipeGroup at position (5.5, 31.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (8.5, 34.5)\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of:\n- Electricity Group with poles at various positions, including (x=-16.5, y=25.5), (x=-12.5, y=24.5), and (x=19.5, y=26.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Boiler and Steam Engine Connectivity\n- Ensure that the boiler and steam engine are correctly connected to the fluid system and power network. Check for proper fluid input and output connections to avoid the \"NOT_CONNECTED\" status.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Power Supply\n- Make sure inserters are connected to the power network to avoid \"NO_POWER\" status. Check the connections to nearby electricity poles.\n\n### Errors with Fluid System Setup\n- Verify that all pipes and pumps are correctly connected to ensure fluid flow. Check for any missing connections or incorrect placements that might lead to \"no fluid present in connections\" warnings.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Operations\n- Ensure that the furnace has the necessary ingredients to smelt to avoid \"NO_INGREDIENTS\" warnings. Regularly check and supply the required materials."}
