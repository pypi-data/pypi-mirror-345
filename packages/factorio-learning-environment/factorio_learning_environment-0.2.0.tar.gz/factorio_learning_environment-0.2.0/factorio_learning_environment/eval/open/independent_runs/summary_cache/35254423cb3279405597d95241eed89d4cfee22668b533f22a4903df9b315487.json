{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Warnings: Chest at drop position is full. Empty the chest at (-14.5, -48.5) to continue mining.\n  - Neighbours: \n    - Wooden Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n    - Burner Inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Contains: 11 units of iron ore\n  - Status: Normal\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Status: Waiting for Source Items\n  - Warnings: Out of fuel\n  - Neighbours:\n    - Wooden Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n    - Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n    - Stone Furnace at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0)\n  - Status: No Ingredients\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Fuel: 6 units of coal\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Misalignment\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly aligned to transfer items from the chest to the furnace. Reposition the inserter if necessary to ensure proper item transfer.\n\n### Inserter Out of Fuel\n- Regularly refuel inserters to maintain continuous operation. Monitor fuel levels and refuel with coal or other available fuel sources.\n\n### Chest Full Warning\n- Monitor the inventory of chests to prevent them from becoming full. Regularly extract items from chests to maintain mining operations.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Ingredients\n- Check the setup of inserters and ensure they are correctly positioned and fueled to transfer ingredients to the furnace. Ensure that the furnace has the necessary ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Mining Drill Drop Position Full\n- Ensure that the drop position of the mining drill is not obstructed or full. Regularly clear the chest or other entities at the drop position to allow continuous mining."}
