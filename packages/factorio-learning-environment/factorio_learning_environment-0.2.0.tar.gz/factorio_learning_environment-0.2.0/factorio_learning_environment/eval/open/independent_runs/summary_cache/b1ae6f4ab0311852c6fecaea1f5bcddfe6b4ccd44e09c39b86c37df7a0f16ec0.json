{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, -60.0) fueled with coal, extracting iron ore. It is connected to:\n  - **Wooden Chest** at position (4.5, -58.5) which stores extracted iron ore.\n  - Additional **Wooden Chests** at positions (5.5, -60.5), (7.5, -60.5), (6.5, -60.5), (9.5, -60.5), and (8.5, -60.5) for storage purposes.\n- **Iron Chest** at position (-5.5, -50.5) storing iron ore and iron plates.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (-15.0, -48.0), (-13.0, -48.0), and (-11.0, -48.0) fueled with coal, used for smelting iron ore into iron plates. These furnaces are currently not processing due to lack of ingredients.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-14.5, -50.5), (-13.5, -50.5), (-12.5, -50.5), (-11.5, -50.5), (-10.5, -50.5), (-9.5, -50.5), (-8.5, -50.5), (-7.5, -50.5), and (-6.5, -50.5) for storing iron plates. Some chests are full, indicating a need for better inventory management.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Full Inventory Management\n- Ensure that chests are emptied regularly to prevent mining drills from halting due to full storage. This can be done by setting up a logistic system or manually transferring items to other storage units.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Operations\n- Ensure that furnaces have a continuous supply of ingredients to maintain production efficiency. Regularly check and supply the necessary raw materials to the furnaces.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `iron_ore_count: int` - Represents the quantity of iron ore in storage.\n- `iron_plate_count: int` - Represents the quantity of iron plates in storage.\n- `coal_count: int` - Represents the quantity of coal available for fueling entities."}
