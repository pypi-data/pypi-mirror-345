{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage at Position (x=41.0, y=-82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=40.5, y=-83.5)\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=41.5, y=-83.5) transferring coal to the Wooden Chest at position (x=40.5, y=-83.5)\n- Additional Wooden Chests at positions (x=42.5, y=-83.5), (x=43.5, y=-83.5), and (x=44.5, y=-83.5) for coal storage\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=61.0, y=-54.0) and another at position (x=64.0, y=-53.0) for smelting\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=62.5, y=-53.5) and another at position (x=65.5, y=-52.5) for feeding materials into the furnaces\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=61.5, y=-52.5) for storing materials and products\n\n### Transport Belt System\n- BeltGroup consisting of multiple belts starting from position (x=43.5, y=-81.5) and connecting to various positions, including (x=63.5, y=-50.5) and (x=64.5, y=-50.5), facilitating the movement of items between different parts of the facility\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Connecting Transport Belts\n- Ensure that the path for connecting transport belts is valid and can be normalized. Check for any obstructions or incorrect path configurations that might prevent successful connections.\n- Consider removing any obstructing belts or entities that might interfere with the intended path of the transport belt.\n\n### Errors Related to Full Chests\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are full to prevent interruptions in mining and production processes. Ensure that there is sufficient space in destination chests to continue operations smoothly.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `connect_entities`: This function is used to connect entities such as transport belts. It failed multiple times due to invalid paths that could not be normalized. Ensure that the start and end positions are correctly specified and that there are no obstructions along the path.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `belt_to_inserter_1`: Represents the connection from a starting belt position to an inserter. Ensure the path is clear and valid.\n- `belt_to_inserter_2`: Similar to `belt_to_inserter_1`, this variable also faced issues with invalid paths."}
