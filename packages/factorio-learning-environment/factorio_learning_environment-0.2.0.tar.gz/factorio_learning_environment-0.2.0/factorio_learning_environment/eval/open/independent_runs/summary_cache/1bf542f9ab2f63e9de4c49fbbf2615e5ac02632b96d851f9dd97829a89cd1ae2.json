Historical failures include IDs (16620, 16663, 16706, 16749, 16792, 16835, 16878, 16921; 16964, 17007, 17050, 17093, 17136, 17179, 17222, 17265) while recent attempts used IDs (17308, 17351, 17394, 17437, 17480, 17523, 17566, 17609). Ensure that each connection targets an existing, active PipeGroup with the correct fluid_system configuration.\n\n\u2022 Inefficient Pipeline Stabilization:\n  - Replace fixed wait intervals (10-second delays) with dynamic status checks to verify pipeline readiness prior to proceeding."}
