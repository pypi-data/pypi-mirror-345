{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo permanent structures have been successfully placed on the map. Multiple recovery attempts centered on establishing a Lab at position (0.5, 2.5) were executed but none completed due to missing inventory items and insufficient resources. Although existing smelting facilities (one furnace at Position(x=5.0, y=5.0) and one copper furnace at Position(x=-27.0, y=-60.0)) were referenced for resource processing, no new structures were built by the agent in these steps.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 API Parameter Misuse\n  - When invoking get_entities, use the correct argument style. Avoid including an unexpected keyword (e.g. 'radius') or passing positional parameters if the API does not accept them.\n  \n\u2022 Entity Retrieval and Iteration\n  - Verify that queries for entities return a valid, iterable collection. If retrieval functions may return None, use a fallback (such as an empty list) before attempting to iterate.\n\n\u2022 Placement Failures\n  - Before attempting to place a structure (e.g. a Lab), ensure the corresponding item is present in the inventory to avoid placement errors.\n\n\u2022 Crafting Dependency Shortages\n  - Confirm that all required sub-ingredients for crafting complex items (such as Labs) are available. In cases where errors indicate missing components (iron-plates, iron-gear-wheels, electronic circuits, copper cables, etc.), prioritize producing those ingredients\u2014ensuring appropriate smelting or crafting machines are available\u2014before reattempting the craft."}
