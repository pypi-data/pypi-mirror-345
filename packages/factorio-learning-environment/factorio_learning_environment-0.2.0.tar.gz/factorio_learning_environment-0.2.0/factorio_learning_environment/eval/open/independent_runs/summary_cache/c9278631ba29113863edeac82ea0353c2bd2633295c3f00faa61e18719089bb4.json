Although the agent attempted to supply a Lab at (0.5, 2.5) and reattempted Lab crafting, all placement and production attempts failed. Other operations (such as retrieving furnaces at (5.0, 5.0) and at (\u201327.0, \u201360.0) for smelting tasks) referenced pre\u2010existing processing facilities and were used solely for resource conversion rather than being created by the agent.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 API Call Errors with get_entities  \n  \u2013 Avoid passing unsupported keywords (e.g. \u201cradius\u201d) and ensure that the number and type of positional arguments match the function\u2019s signature.\n\n\u2022 Lab Placement Failures  \n  \u2013 Before attempting to place a Lab at (0.5, 2.5), verify that a Lab unit exists in the inventory to avoid placement errors.\n\n\u2022 Iteration on a NoneType  \n  \u2013 When filtering or iterating over entities returned from get_entities(), ensure that the fallback value is an empty iterable rather than None.\n\n\u2022 Lab Crafting Resource Shortages  \n  \u2013 Multiple lab crafting attempts failed due to missing sub-ingredients (such as iron-gear-wheel, electronic-circuit, and copper-cable). Confirm that all prerequisite resources and intermediary items are available and craftable before initiating a lab build.\n\n\u2022 Overall Resource Chain Validation  \n  \u2013 Repeated unavailability of a Lab indicates that the resource production chain (including smelting and crafting of required components) must be thoroughly verified and balanced before reattempting Lab creation."}
