{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (5.5, 21.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (5.5, 21.5)\n- Boiler at position (-1.5, 24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe Group connecting the Offshore Pump to the Boiler and Steam Engine\n\n### Iron Smelting Facility\nConsists of:\n- Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) fueled with coal and processing iron ore\n\n### Research Lab at Position (2.5, 0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Lab connected to the power network, currently missing science packs for research\n\n### Power Network\nConsists of:\n- Electricity Group with poles at positions (1.5, 10.5), (3.5, 20.5), (1.5, 14.5), (1.5, 2.5), (1.5, 6.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Undefined Name Error\n- Ensure that all entity names are defined before using them in the code. Consider checking for typos or missing imports.\n\n### Pipe Connection Failures\n- Verify that all required pipes are available in the inventory before attempting connections.\n- Ensure that pipes are correctly aligned and connected between entities like offshore pumps, boilers, and steam engines.\n\n### Steam Engine Not Working\n- Check that the steam engine is properly connected to the power network and that all necessary components (boiler, offshore pump) are functioning.\n\n### Insufficient Inventory for Crafting\n- Maintain a sufficient stock of necessary items in the inventory to avoid crafting failures, especially for automation science packs and iron gear wheels.\n\n### Low on Automation Science Packs\n- Regularly craft or acquire more automation science packs to ensure continuous research progress.\n\n### Not Enough Pipes in Inventory\n- Craft or acquire more pipes to ensure successful connections between entities.\n\n### Failed Crafting Due to Missing Sub-Ingredients\n- Ensure that all sub-ingredients required for crafting an item are available, and use appropriate crafting machines or furnaces when necessary.\n\n### Errors in Pipe Connections\n- Ensure that pipes are not only available but also correctly placed and connected between the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine. Double-check alignment and connectivity.\n\n### Research Setting Errors\n- Ensure that the lab has the correct science packs and that research is properly initiated. Check for any missing or incorrect inputs.\n\n### Boiler Refueling Issues\n- Maintain a sufficient stock of coal in the inventory to ensure the boiler remains fueled and operational."}
