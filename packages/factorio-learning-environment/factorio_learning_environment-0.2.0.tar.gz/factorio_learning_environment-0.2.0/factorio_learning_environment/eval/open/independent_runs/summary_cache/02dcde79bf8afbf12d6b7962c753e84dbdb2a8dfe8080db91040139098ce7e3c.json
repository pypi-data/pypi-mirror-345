{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0), which extracts iron ore and is fueled with coal.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5), which stores the extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5), which transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the stone furnace. It is also fueled with coal.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0), which is intended to smelt the iron ore into iron plates but is currently not receiving any iron ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Alignment and Positioning\n- Ensure the inserter's pickup position is correctly aligned with the chest containing the iron ore. Misalignment can prevent the inserter from picking up items.\n- Verify that the inserter's drop position is correctly aligned with the furnace to ensure successful transfer of iron ore.\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities\n- Before placing an entity, confirm that the target position is not occupied by another entity or unsuitable for placement (e.g., water or collision with existing entities). Adjust spacing, direction, or reference position if necessary.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Resources\n- Ensure sufficient resources are available in the inventory before attempting to refuel entities or insert items. For example, ensure coal is available before attempting to refuel a mining drill or inserter.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Ingredients\n- Regularly check the setup of inserters and ensure they are operational and correctly configured to deliver ingredients to the furnace. The furnace will not operate without the necessary ingredients for smelting."}
