{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n---------------------------------\n### Iron Smelting Furnace at Position(x=5.0, y=5.0)\nUsed to process iron ore with coal into additional iron plates.\n\u2022 Entity: Furnace located at (5.0, 5.0).\n\n### Copper Smelting Furnace at Position(x=-27.0, y=-60.0)\nUsed to convert copper ore (harvested from nearby patches) and coal into copper plates.\n\u2022 Entity: Furnace located at (-27.0, -60.0).\n\nERROR TIPS\n---------------------------------\n\u2022 API Parameter Errors:\n  \u2013 When calling get_entities(), use only supported argument types. Avoid passing unsupported keyword arguments (e.g. \u201cradius\u201d) or extra positional parameters.\n  \n\u2022 Handling Null Returns:\n  \u2013 Always check that entity retrieval calls do not return None before iterating over the results. Use a fallback (such as an empty list) when no entities are found.\n  \n\u2022 Lab Crafting and Placement Issues:\n  \u2013 Ensure that all required sub-ingredients for lab crafting (such as sufficient iron-plates for iron-gear-wheel production, copper-plates for copper-cable, and electronic-circuit components) are available before attempting to craft a lab.\n  \u2013 Verify that a lab is present in the inventory prior to placement to avoid placement errors."}
