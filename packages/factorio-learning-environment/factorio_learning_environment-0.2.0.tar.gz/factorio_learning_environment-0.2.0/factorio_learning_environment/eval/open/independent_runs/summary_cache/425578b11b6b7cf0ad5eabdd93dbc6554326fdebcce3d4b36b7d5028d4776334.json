{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Extraction System at position (-3.5, 27.5)\nConsists of:\n\u2013 A burner inserter (extraction system unit) positioned at (\u20133.5, 27.5) with its drop point at (\u20133.5, 28.5)\nUse-case: Extracts items from a deposit for onward transport.\n\n### Copper Cable Factory at approximately (2.5\u20133.5, 17.5)\nConsists of:\n\u2013 A cable factory input chest at (2.5, 17.5)\n\u2013 A new factory burner inserter placed at (3.5, 17.5) using direction RIGHT\n\u2013 An existing factory burner inserter at (2.5, 16.5)\n\u2013 An assembling machine at (1.5, 19.5)\nUse-case: Processes copper plates into copper cables and feeds the production line.\n\n### Belt Depot at position (3.5, 15.5)\nConsists of:\n\u2013 A wooden chest placed at (3.5, 15.5) serving as an isolated belt depot\n\u2013 A dedicated transport belt segment positioned at (4.5, 15.5) adjacent to the chest\n\u2013 A depot burner inserter placed at (3.5, 14.5) using direction UP\nUse-case: Provides an intermediate connection point to route items from the extraction system into the factory network.\n\n### Electricity Generator at position (\u20130.5, 24.5)\nConsists of:\n\u2013 A generator (steam engine) at (\u20130.5, 24.5)\n\u2013 A boiler at (\u20135.5, 24.0)\n\u2013 An offshore pump at (\u20137.5, 25.5)\nUse-case: Supplies power to the facility (despite current warnings regarding power connections and fluid input).\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n\u2022 Transport Belt Connection Errors\n\u00a0\u00a0\u2013 When connecting transport belts, ensure the target entity is not a steam engine. Always add an inserter to serve as the input for the steam engine so that connections are accepted.\n\n\u2022 Placement Distance Issues\n\u00a0\u00a0\u2013 Verify that the agent is within the allowed placement range before attempting to place an entity. If the target position is too far, move closer to meet the distance requirement.\n\n\u2022 Missing Inventory Items\n\u00a0\u00a0\u2013 Before placing an item (such as a wooden chest), confirm that it is present in the player's inventory to avoid placement failures due to missing items.\n\n\u2022 Undefined Variable Errors\n\u00a0\u00a0\u2013 Ensure that all variables are correctly defined and referenced. Validate variable names to prevent NameError issues when accessing properties of intended target entities."}
