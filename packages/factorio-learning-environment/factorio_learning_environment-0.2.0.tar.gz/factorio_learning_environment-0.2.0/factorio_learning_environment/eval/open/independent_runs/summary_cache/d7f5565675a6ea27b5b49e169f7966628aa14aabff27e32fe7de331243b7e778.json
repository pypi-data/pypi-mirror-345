{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report - Steps 0-71\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation (Water -> Steam -> Electricity)\n*   **Purpose:** Generates electricity from water using coal as fuel.\n*   **Components:**\n    *   Offshore Pump at x=-9.5 y=-0.5 (Extracts water, Status: WORKING)\n    *   Boiler at x=-5.0 y=2.5 (Heats water to steam using coal, Status: NO_FUEL)\n    *   Steam Engine at x=0.5 y=6.5 (Generates electricity from steam, Status: NOT_CONNECTED - no fluid present in connections, not connected to power network)\n    *   PipeGroup connecting Offshore Pump to Boiler (fluid_system=17554, fluid=water, status=WORKING)\n    *   PipeGroup connecting Boiler to Steam Engine (fluid_system=17561, status=EMPTY)\n*   **Updates:**\n    *   Pipes connecting the Offshore Pump, Boiler, and Steam Engine were successfully placed and connected (Steps 66, 68).\n    *   The Boiler is now connected to the water supply but is out of fuel (Status: NO_FUEL).\n    *   The Steam Engine is connected to the Boiler via pipes but is not receiving steam and reports no fluid/power connection issues.\n\n### Coal Mine\n*   **Purpose:** Mines coal and stores it in a chest.\n*   **Components:**\n    *   Electric Mining Drill at x=15.5 y=-0.5 (Status: NO_POWER)\n    *   Wooden Chest at x=15.5 y=1.5 (Receives coal from the drill, Contains: 749 coal)\n*   **Updates:** Drill remains unpowered. Chest has accumulated coal.\n\n### Crude Oil Extraction and Processing\n*   **Purpose:** Extracts crude oil, refines it into petroleum gas, and produces plastic bars.\n*   **Components:**\n    *   **Extraction:**\n        *   Pumpjack at x=17.5 y=40.5 (Status: NO_POWER)\n        *   Pumpjack at x=20.5 y=40.5 (Status: NO_POWER)\n        *   PipeGroup (fluid_system=17578, status=EMPTY) connecting both Pumpjacks to the Refinery's crude oil input (x=23.5 y=30.5).\n    *   **Refining:**\n        *   Oil Refinery at x=22.5 y=27.5 (Status: NO_POWER, Recipe: advanced-oil"}
