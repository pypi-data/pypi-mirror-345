While segments between (1.5,25.5)\u2013(4.5,25.5) and from (4.5,18.5) to (4.5,13.5) auto-connected, connection attempts at the start and mid-section failed.\n\u2022 Subsequent manual placement efforts (Steps 298 and 300) for the failed segments were unsuccessful even after clearing interfering belts.\n\u2022 In a further re-routing attempt (Step 302), a new corridor was mapped using waypoints: northward from (x=-3.5, y=25.5) to (x=-3.5, y=28.5), then eastward to (x=4.5, y=28.5) and downward to (x=4.5, y=13.5) toward the target. Auto-connections succeeded for later segments, but initial segments (from (x=-3.5, y=25.5) to (x=-3.5, y=28.5) and onward) failed, and manual placements (Step 303) again yielded no belts.\n\u2022 Final state: Only partial segments have auto-connected, leaving critical corridor sections unbuildable and the continuous extraction network incomplete.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 Target and Source Entity Type Errors:\n\u2003- When connecting transport belts, do not use entities like Steam Engines or Assembling Machines directly as endpoints. Always incorporate an inserter to serve as the connection interface.\n\n\u2022 Path Routing and Normalisation Issues:\n\u2003- Ensure connection paths are grid-aligned and divided into short segments. Errors such as \u201cNot a valid path to normalise\u201d indicate that the chosen waypoints or long direct segments are incompatible with auto-connection routines.\n\n\u2022 Manual Placement and Buildability Conflicts:\n\u2003- Before manual placement of transport belts, verify that each target tile is buildable and free of interference. Repeated \u201cCannot place belt at\u2026\u201d errors suggest that alternative routing or further clearing may be required.\n\n\u2022 Consistent Corridor Reassessment:\n\u2003- Repeated failures in both auto-connected and manually placed segments imply the routed corridors are too congested or inherently unbuildable. Reevaluate corridor selection to identify less obstructed paths for a continuous extraction network.\n\n\u2022 Pickup Area and Parameter Validation:\n\u2003- Maintain clear pickup areas free of obstructive entities, and ensure the use of proper argument types in connection functions. This remains essential even as new routing challenges emerge."}
