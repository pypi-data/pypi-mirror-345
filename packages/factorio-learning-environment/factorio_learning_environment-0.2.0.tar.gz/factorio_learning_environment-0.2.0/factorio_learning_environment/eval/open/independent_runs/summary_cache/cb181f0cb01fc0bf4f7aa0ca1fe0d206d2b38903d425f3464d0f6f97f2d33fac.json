{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo permanent structures have been successfully placed on the map. Multiple attempts were made to establish a Laboratory at position (0.5, 2.5) for supplying Automation Science Packs to research, but all placement and crafting attempts failed due to missing inventory and insufficient resources. No other newly created building or connected structure was confirmed on the map.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 API Usage Issues when Retrieving Entities\n  - Ensure the get_entities function is called with the correct parameter format. Avoid using unexpected keywords (such as \"radius\") or incorrect positional arguments. Consult the API documentation to match the expected signature.\n  \n\u2022 Handling None Values when Iterating over Entities\n  - Always validate that a returned entity collection is not None before iterating over it. Use a fallback to an empty list if necessary to prevent iteration errors.\n\n\u2022 Lab Placement and Inventory Verification\n  - Confirm that the Laboratory item is present in the inventory prior to attempting placement. A missing lab in inventory results in placement failures.\n\n\u2022 Resource and Sub-ingredient Shortages for Lab Crafting\n  - Verify that all required sub-ingredients (e.g., iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, copper-cables, and their base materials) are available or can be produced by appropriate facilities before initiating lab crafting. Addressing production chain bottlenecks and ensuring a steady resource flow can prevent repeated crafting errors."}
