This often resolves issues with unresponsive environments.\n2. **Check for Updates**: Ensure that you are using the latest version of Factorio, as updates can fix bugs and improve stability.\n3. **Clear Cache or Settings**: Sometimes, clearing the cache or resetting settings can help resolve issues with unresponsive environments.\n4. **Consult Community Forums**: If the issue persists after a restart, consider checking Factorio community forums or support channels for similar issues and potential fixes.\n\n### Tips for Future Interactions:\n- **Start with Simple Commands**: When testing the REPL, begin with basic commands to confirm responsiveness before moving on to more complex scripts.\n- **Implement Error Handling**: Use error handling in your scripts to catch issues early and avoid getting stuck.\n- **Refer to Documentation**: Always consult the Factorio API documentation for guidance on available commands and their proper usage.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe current state of the environment is unworkable, and a restart of the game seems necessary to regain functionality.
