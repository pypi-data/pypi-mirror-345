{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(2.5, 2.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Small electric pole (position 2.5, 2.5)\n- Lab (position 2.0, 0.0) - currently not powered\n- Electricity group (id=9287) with poles at positions (2.5, 2.5) and (0.5, 1.5)\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace (position 0.0, 0.0) - currently has no ingredients to smelt\n- Furnace (position 2.0, 0.0) - currently has no ingredients to smelt\n\n### Wooden chest at position(3.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest (position 3.5, 0.5) - currently empty\n\n### Copper cable factory at position(0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine (position 0.0, 0.0) - currently not operational due to lack of ingredients\n- Inserter (position not specified) that puts into the assembling machine\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing new pole\n- Ensure that the first argument for placing a pole is a valid Prototype object. Verify the parameters before attempting to place a new pole.\n\n### Errors when lab is not powered\n- Check the power connections to the lab. Ensure that there are sufficient power sources connected to the lab to keep it operational.\n\n### Errors due to missing ingredients for research\n- Ensure that you have the required ingredients (in this case, 10 automation science packs) in your inventory before starting the research.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it. Check for existing entities in the target position."}
