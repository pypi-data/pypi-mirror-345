{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n###Iron Plate Production Area (Position x=0-4, y=0)\nConsists of two stone furnaces:\n- Furnace 1 at position(0,0)\n- Furnace 2 at position(2,0)\nBoth furnaces process iron ore into iron plates\n\n###Copper Plate Production Area (Position x=4, y=4)\nSingle stone furnace that processes copper ore into copper plates\n\n###Electronic Circuit Assembly Line (Position x=6.5-12.5, y=11.5)\nComplex production line consisting of:\n- Input wooden chest at position(6.5, 11.5)\n- Burner inserter at position(7.5, 11.5) connecting input chest to assembler\n- Assembling machine at position(9.5, 11.5) crafting electronic circuits\n- Burner inserter at position(11.5, 11.5) moving finished products\n- Output wooden chest at position(12.5, 11.5) storing electronic circuits\n\n###Power Generation System (Position x=-9.5 to -2.5, y=22.5-28.5)\nComplete power generation setup:\n- Offshore pump at position(-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe network carrying water at positions(-9.5,23.5),(-8.5,23.5),(-8.5,22.5),(-7.5,22.5)\n- Boiler at position(-7.0, 24.5)\n- Steam pipe at position(-5.5, 24.5)\n- Steam engine at position(-2.5, 24.5)\n- Electric pole network connecting power to other structures\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing lab\n- Cannot place lab at position(0.5, 28.5) or (0.5, 30.5) due to:\n  - Something blocking the target location\n  - Terrain being unplaceable (water)\n- Ensure target location is clear and on valid terrain before placing lab\n\n### Errors when accessing lab entity\n- Getting lab entity at position(0.5, 28.5) fails\n- Ensure lab is properly placed before trying to access it\n- Verify lab position coordinates are correct\n\n### Resource shortages\n- Electronic circuit production halts due to missing:\n  - Iron plates (1 needed)\n  - Copper cables (3 needed)\n- Ensure consistent supply of raw materials to production lines\n\n### Furnace operation issues\n- Furnaces frequently show NO_INGREDIENTS status\n- Maintain regular supply of both fuel (coal) and ore to keep furnaces operational"}
