{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-18.5, 19.5)\nConsists of boiler (position -13.5, 20.0) and steam engine (position -18.5, 19.5). The boiler is designed to convert water into steam, which is then utilized by the steam engine to generate electricity.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(-18.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position -18.0, -49.0) and a furnace (position -18.0, -49.0).\n\n### Offshore pump at position(-11.5, 26.5)\nConsists of an offshore pump (position -11.5, 26.5) that extracts water from the sea, which can be used in the boiler for steam generation.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting pipes\n- Ensure that the positions of the entities you are trying to connect are within the valid range for pipe connections. Check the coordinates and make sure they are aligned correctly.\n- Verify that there are no existing pipes or entities obstructing the connection path.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it. Check the surrounding area for existing entities that may block placement.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items."}
