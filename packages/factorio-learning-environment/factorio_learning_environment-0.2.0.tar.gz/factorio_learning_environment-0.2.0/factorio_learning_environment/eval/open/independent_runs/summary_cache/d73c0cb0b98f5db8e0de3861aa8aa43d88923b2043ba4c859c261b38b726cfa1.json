{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Mining and Smelting Complex at (-28, -61)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-28.0, -61.0) connected to stone furnace at (-27.0, -59.0)\n- Burner inserter at (-25.5, -58.5) moving items to wooden chest at (-24.5, -58.5)\n- Additional stone furnaces at (-23.0, -58.0) and (-21.0, -58.0)\n- Output chest at (-22.5, -55.5) collecting iron plates\n\n### Large Iron Mining Operation at (-10, -59)\nConsists of:\n- Three burner mining drills at (-10.0, -59.0), (-8.0, -59.0), and (-6.0, -59.0)\n- Collection chests at (-9.5, -57.5), (-7.5, -57.5), and (-5.5, -57.5)\n- Multiple burner inserters managing item movement between drills and chests\n- Transport belt system connecting the mining area\n\n### Iron Smelting Array at (0, 0)\nConsists of:\n- Four stone furnaces at (0.0, 0.0), (2.0, 0.0), (4.0, 0.0), and (6.0, 0.0)\n- Input chests at (0.5, -2.5), (2.5, -2.5), (4.5, -2.5), and (6.5, -2.5)\n- Output chests at (0.5, 2.5), (2.5, 2.5), (4.5, 2.5), and (6.5, 2.5)\n- Burner inserters managing input and output for each furnace\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied spaces\n- Check if the target position is clear before attempting to place a wooden chest or other entities\n- Ensure there are no items on the ground or other entities blocking the placement\n\n### Errors with inserter operations\n- Inserters are showing \"waiting for space in destination\" warnings - ensure output paths are clear\n- Some inserters are blocked by items on the ground - add appropriate destination entities\n- Multiple furnace belts are blocked at drop positions - optimize belt layout to prevent backups\n\n### Resource management errors\n- Cannot insert coal due to empty inventory - ensure sufficient coal is available before attempting to fuel entities\n- Some mining drills have output blocked warnings - add appropriate output collection methods\n\n### Furnace optimization issues\n- Multiple furnaces showing \"no ingredients to smelt\" - ensure proper input feed\n- Some furnaces have \"fuel source is full\" warnings - adjust fuel insertion rate"}
