{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n###Iron Plate Production Area at position(-11.5, 19.5)\nConsists of two stone furnaces for smelting iron ore into iron plates:\n- First stone furnace at position(-11.0, 20.0)\n- Second stone furnace at position(-9.0, 20.0)\nBoth furnaces are operational and processing iron ore into iron plates, positioned near the iron ore source.\n\nERROR TIPS\n### Errors when attempting to craft items requiring assembly machines\n- Iron gear wheels cannot be crafted by hand as they require assembly machines\n- Before attempting to craft items like iron gear wheels, ensure you:\n  1. Have the required assembly machine built\n  2. Have the necessary raw materials (iron plates) available\n  3. Use the assembly machine for crafting instead of trying to craft manually\n\nThe agent should focus on setting up proper manufacturing facilities with assembly machines for items that cannot be crafted by hand."}
