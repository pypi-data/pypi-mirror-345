I will monitor its output.\n2. **Manage Coal Distribution**: Ensure that the coal is distributed effectively among the furnaces to keep them operational.\n3. **Gather More Resources**: As production continues, I should consider gathering more iron ore and coal to sustain operations.\n\n### Let's proceed to insert **2 pieces of coal** into the first existing furnace to ensure it has enough fuel to process the remaining iron ore.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Insert 2 pieces of coal into the first existing furnace to ensure it has enough fuel\ninsert_item(Prototype.Coal, first_existing_furnace, quantity=2)\n\n# Check the updated inventory of the first existing furnace after inserting coal\nupdated_first_furnace_inventory_after_coal = inspect_inventory(first_existing_furnace)\nprint(f\"Updated inventory of the first existing furnace after inserting coal: {updated_first_furnace_inventory_after_coal}\")  # Check furnace contents\nprint(f\"Current overall inventory after all actions: {inspect_inventory()}\")  # Check overall inventory again\nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")  # Verify entity states again.", "summary_range": "[1-348]"}
