{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) which extracts iron ore and deposits it into a chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5) which stores the extracted iron ore. Currently contains 534 units of iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5) which is intended to transfer iron ore from the chest to the furnace. It is currently misaligned, causing the furnace not to receive iron ore.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0) which is intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates. Currently, it is not receiving iron ore due to misalignment of the inserter.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Misalignment of Inserter\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly aligned to transfer items from the chest to the furnace. Regularly check and adjust the inserter's position and direction to ensure it is functioning as intended.\n\n### Insufficient Inventory for Operations\n- Before attempting to insert items into entities, verify that the necessary items are available in your inventory. For example, ensure you have enough coal before attempting to refuel entities.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Ingredients\n- Regularly check the setup of inserters and ensure they are properly configured to supply the furnace with the necessary ingredients for smelting. Adjust the inserter's position if the furnace is not receiving the required materials."}
