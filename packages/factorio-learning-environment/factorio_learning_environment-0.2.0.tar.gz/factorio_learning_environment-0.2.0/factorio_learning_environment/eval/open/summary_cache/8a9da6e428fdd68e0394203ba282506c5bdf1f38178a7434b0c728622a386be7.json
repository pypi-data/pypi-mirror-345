{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron ore mining and smelting structure at position around (17.5, 72.5)\nConsists of the following connected entities:\n- Electric mining drill at position (17.5, 72.5) facing down, currently without power and output blocked due to furnace belt blockage.\n- Stone furnace at position (18.0, 75.0) used for smelting iron ore, fueled with coal, currently working but with frequent full output inventory warnings.\n- Four wooden chests at positions (19.5, 75.5), (21.5, 75.5), (21.5, 77.5), and newly placed chest at (23.5, 75.5), serving as intermediate storage to alleviate output blockage.\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5), (20.5, 77.5), (22.5, 75.5), and (25.5, 83.5) fueled with coal and operational, moving iron plates between chests and machines.\n- Small electric pole at (15.5, 75.5) connected to power network.\n- Output blockage at furnace belt drop position mitigated by adding a wooden chest at (23.5, 75.5), clearing previous blockage.\n\nThis structure enables extraction, smelting, and staged storage of iron plates, with improved handling of output blockage through additional chest placement and inserter management, though mining drill remains without power.\n\n### Steam power generation structure at position around (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, -0.5) extracting water.\n- Boiler at position (-5.0, 2.5), currently out of fuel and not working despite previous fueling attempts.\n- Steam engine at position (0.5, 6.5), not connected to power network and lacking input fluid, currently not generating power.\n- Small electric poles near boiler (-4.5, -0.5) and steam engine (0.5, 3.5).\n\nThis structure is intended to generate electricity from steam power but is currently non-operational due to boiler fuel shortage and steam engine disconnection from the power network.\n\n### Iron gear wheel assembly structure at position around (25.5, 80.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine 2 at (25.5, 80.5), connected to power network but currently not receiving power due to network issues.\n- Input wooden chest at (21.5, 75.5) feeding iron plates into assembly area.\n- Output wooden chest at (25.5, 82.5) storing assembled iron gear wheels.\n- Output burner inserter at (25.5, 83.5) fueled and operational, moving assembled items into output chest.\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 77.5), (22.5, 75.5), and (25.5, 83.5) fueled and operational.\n- Newly added burner inserter at (22.5, 75.5) placed to improve material flow.\n- Assembling machine input inventory intermittently filled with iron plates and iron gear wheels, but output chest occasionally empty indicating flow issues.\n\nThis structure is designed for iron gear wheel production with improved inserter setup and input supply, but suffers from power network disconnection and output flow problems.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Output blockage and item flow management\n- Initial output blockage at furnace belt drop position caused mining drill to stop due to blocked output.\n- Adding a wooden chest at (23.5, 75.5) successfully cleared the blockage, allowing smoother item flow.\n- Avoid connecting transport belts directly from wooden chests; use inserters to transfer items from chests to belts or machines.\n- When connecting belts, ensure source entities are valid belt-compatible entities, not chests.\n\n### Power network and fuel supply issues\n- Boiler at (-5.0, 2.5) repeatedly runs out of fuel causing steam engine at (0.5, 6.5) to stop generating power.\n- Steam engine is not connected to the power network, resulting in no power output despite working boilers previously.\n- Ensure boilers are consistently fueled and steam engines are properly connected to electric poles to maintain power generation.\n- Check power pole placement and connections to avoid isolated power consumers.\n\n### Inserter operation warnings and management\n- Inserters at (20.5, 75.5), (22.5, 75.5), and (25.5, 83.5) sometimes wait for source items or destination space.\n- To prevent inserter stoppages, maintain balanced input and output inventories and ensure destination chests or machines have capacity.\n- Monitor inserter fuel levels; current fueling is sufficient but continue to keep inserters fueled to avoid downtime.\n\n### Assembly machine power and input supply\n- Assembling machine at (25.5"}
