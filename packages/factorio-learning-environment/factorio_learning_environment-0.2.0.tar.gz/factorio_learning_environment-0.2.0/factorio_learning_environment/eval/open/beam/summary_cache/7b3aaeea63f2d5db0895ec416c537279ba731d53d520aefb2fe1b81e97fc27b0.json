For example, crafting a burner mining drill requires iron plates, which must be smelted from iron ore using a furnace.\n\n### Errors in Placing Entities Without Required Items in Inventory\n- Verify that the necessary items are present in the inventory before attempting to place an entity. For instance, attempting to place a wooden chest without having one in the inventory will result in an error.\n\n### Errors in Crafting Raw Resource Items\n- Remember that certain items, like stone, are raw resources and cannot be crafted. They must be gathered directly from the environment. Ensure raw resources are collected before attempting to craft items that require them.\n\n### Errors in Placing Entities on Occupied Tiles\n- Ensure that the target tile is unoccupied before attempting to place an entity. If an object is already present, reposition the entity or clear the space.\n\n### Errors in Inserting Items Without Inventory Stock\n- Confirm that the items you wish to insert are available in your inventory. For instance, attempting to insert iron ore into a furnace when none is available will result in an error.\n\n### Errors in Connecting Entities Without Required Items\n- Ensure that you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to connect entities with transport belts or other connectors.\n\n### Errors in Crafting Items Requiring Technology\n- Some recipes require specific technologies to be researched before they can be crafted. Ensure you have unlocked the necessary technology before attempting to craft such items.\n\n### Errors in Extracting Items from Non-Existent Inventory\n- Verify that the target entity contains the items you wish to extract. Attempting to extract items from an empty or non-existent inventory will result in an error.\n\n### Errors in Crafting Items Without Required Sub-Ingredients\n- Ensure that all sub-ingredients required for crafting an item are available. For example, crafting transport belts requires iron gear wheels, which in turn require iron plates.\n\n### Errors in Placing Wooden Chests Without Inventory\n- Ensure you have wooden chests in your inventory before attempting to place them. Craft additional chests if necessary.\n\n### Errors in Misaligned or Occupied Placement\n- Check that the placement position is suitable and unoccupied by other entities. Adjust the strategy if"}
