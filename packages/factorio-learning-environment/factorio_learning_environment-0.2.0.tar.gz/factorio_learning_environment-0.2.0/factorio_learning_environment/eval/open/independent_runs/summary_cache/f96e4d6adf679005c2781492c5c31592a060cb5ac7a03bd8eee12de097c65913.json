{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (6.0, -62.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (6.0, -62.0) used for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) that transfers items into a Wooden Chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (6.5, -59.5) for storing iron plates and copper plates.\n- Small Electric Pole at position (7.5, -60.5) providing power to the inserter.\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Boiler at position (-5.5, 24.0) fueled to produce steam.\n- Steam Engine at position (-1.5, 24.5) generating electricity.\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5) supplying water to the boiler.\n- Pipe network connecting the Offshore Pump, Boiler, and Steam Engine, facilitating the flow of water and steam.\n- Small Electric Poles at various positions to distribute generated electricity.\n\n### Research Lab\n- Lab with input for automation science packs, currently not conducting research.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using inserters without power\n- Ensure that inserters are connected to a power source to function correctly. Verify the connection to the electric poles and the power supply to prevent inserter malfunction.\n\n### Errors when operating boilers without sufficient fuel\n- Regularly check the fuel levels in boilers to ensure continuous operation. Refill them with coal or other fuel sources to prevent power outages."}
