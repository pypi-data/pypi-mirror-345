{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position (42.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 42.0, -83.0)\n- Burner inserter (position 43.5, -81.5) that is waiting for space in destination\n- Wooden chest (position 42.5, -81.5) with coal\n- Burner inserter (position 42.5, -80.5) that is waiting for source items\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position -15.0, -50.0)\n- Wooden chest (position -14.5, -48.5) with iron ore\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position 0.0, 0.0) that is working\n- Wooden chest (position -14.5, -48.5) with iron ore\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n- **Errors when inserting items from an empty inventory**: Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities. This was observed when trying to insert coal into the Burner Mining Drill without having any coal.\n- **Errors when using entities that are out of fuel**: Regularly check the fuel status of your Burner Mining Drills to avoid them becoming inactive. They were found to be in a NO_FUEL status multiple times.\n- **Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity**: Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it. This was not explicitly logged but is a common issue in similar scenarios.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- **Utility Functions**:\n  - `insert_item(item_type, target_entity, quantity)`: This function was invoked successfully to insert coal into the Burner Mining Drill, but failed when there was no coal in the inventory.\n  \n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `burner_mining_drill`: Entity reference for the Burner Mining Drill (type: Entity)\n  - `stone_furnace`: Entity reference for the Stone Furnace (type: Entity)\n  - `wooden_chest`: Entity reference for the Wooden Chest (type: Entity)\n  - `coal`: Item reference for Coal (type: Item)\n  - `iron_ore`: Item reference for Iron Ore (type: Item)\n  - `iron_plate`: Item reference for Iron Plate (type: Item)\n  - `iron_gear_wheel`: Item reference for Iron Gear Wheel (type: Item)"}
