{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Storage Area\nThis area consists of multiple wooden chests storing coal at various positions:\n- Chests at positions ranging from (x=97.5, y=-121.5) to (x=38.5, y=-84.5) contain varying amounts of coal. Notably, the chest at (x=97.5, y=-121.5) contains 500 units of coal.\n\n### Iron and Coal Processing Area\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0) connected to a chest at (x=40.5, y=-83.5) and a burner inserter at (x=42.5, y=-83.5).\n- **Burner Inserters** at positions (x=42.5, y=-83.5), (x=61.5, y=-59.5), (x=62.5, y=-58.5), (x=61.5, y=-57.5), (x=61.5, y=-55.5), (x=62.5, y=-52.5), and (x=61.5, y=-51.5) facilitating movement of materials between chests and furnaces.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=61.0, y=-54.0) for smelting operations.\n- Chests at positions (x=61.5, y=-60.5), (x=62.5, y=-60.5), (x=62.5, y=-53.5), (x=61.5, y=-50.5), and (x=62.5, y=-50.5) storing various materials including coal, iron plates, and iron ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Assertion Errors Related to Prototype Argument\n- Ensure that the first argument in relevant function calls is a valid Prototype. This error occurred multiple times, indicating a recurring issue with argument validation.\n\n### Warnings of Full Chests\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are full to prevent production halts. This issue was noted with the burner mining drill and burner inserter, which were unable to continue operations due to full chests.\n\n### Warnings of No Fuel\n- Ensure that all burner entities have sufficient fuel to operate. The burner mining drill at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0) was out of fuel, halting its operation.\n\n### Warnings of No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Ensure that the stone furnace at position (x=61.0, y=-54.0) has the necessary ingredients to perform smelting operations.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions were defined or invoked in the provided steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Maintains the current inventory of items such as 'wooden-chest', 'transport-belt', 'burner-inserter', 'coal', 'iron-ore', 'iron-plate', and 'iron-gear-wheel'.\n- `entities`: List[Entity] - Represents entities on the map, including chests, burner mining drills, burner inserters, and stone furnaces."}
