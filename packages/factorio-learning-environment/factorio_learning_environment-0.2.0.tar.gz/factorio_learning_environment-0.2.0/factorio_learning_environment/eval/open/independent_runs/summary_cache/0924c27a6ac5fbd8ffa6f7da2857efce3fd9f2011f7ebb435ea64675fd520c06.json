{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility at Position (6.0, -62.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (6.0, -62.0) with a fuel inventory of coal and producing copper plates.\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) intended to transfer output from the furnace, but currently not connected to the power network.\n\n### Research Lab\n- Lab with input of automation-science-pack, located at an unspecified position, currently without power.\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Boiler at position (-5.5, 24.0), currently out of fuel.\n- Steam Engine at position (-1.5, 24.5), not connected to the power network and lacking input liquid.\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5), working and supplying water.\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine, facilitating water transport.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities without required items\n- Ensure you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to place them. For example, a wooden chest could not be placed at (7.0, -62.0) due to the absence of a wooden chest in the inventory.\n\n### Errors due to lack of power connection\n- Connect entities like inserters and labs to the power network to ensure they function correctly. The inserter at (6.5, -60.5) and the lab are currently without power.\n\n### Errors due to lack of fuel\n- Ensure that boilers and other fuel-dependent entities are supplied with fuel to maintain operation. The boiler at (-5.5, 24.0) is currently out of fuel.\n\n### Errors due to lack of fluid connection\n- Ensure that steam engines and other fluid-dependent entities are properly connected to a source of fluid. The steam engine at (-1.5, 24.5) is not receiving input liquid."}
