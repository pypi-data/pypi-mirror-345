{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-10.5, 25.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (-1.5, 24.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting these entities, but with connection issues\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at Position (-19.0, -73.0)\nConsists of:\n- Furnace at Position (-19.0, -73.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n\n### Iron Plate Mine at Position (9.0, -64.0)\nConsists of:\n- Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n\n### Assembling and Storage Area\nConsists of:\n- Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) not receiving electricity\n- Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (6.5, -59.5) containing iron plates\n- Lab with no power\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- PipeGroup at Position (-10.5, 24.5) with water, but connection issues\n- Several other PipeGroups with empty status\n\n### Electricity Network\n- ElectricityGroup with poles not providing power\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Pipe Connections\n- Ensure pipes are correctly aligned and unobstructed to connect the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine. Check for any placement blockages that may prevent proper connection.\n\n### Errors in Electricity Pole Connections\n- Verify the correct placement and connection of electricity poles to ensure they are part of the power network. Avoid attempting to connect poles to themselves or to non-existent entities.\n\n### Fluid and Power Generation Issues\n- Ensure the boiler and steam engine have a continuous supply of water and fuel. Check the pipe network for any disconnections or blockages that might prevent fluid flow.\n\n### Inserter and Lab Power Issues\n- Ensure the inserter and lab are connected to a functional power network. Verify that the electricity poles are properly connected and receiving power.\n\n### Assertion Errors in Power Generation\n- Confirm that the steam engine is generating power by ensuring all components are correctly connected and operational. Check for any missing connections or misconfigurations in the setup."}
