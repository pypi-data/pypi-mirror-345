{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (4.0, -60.0) with a drop position at (4.5, -58.5).\n- Multiple Stone Furnaces at positions (-15.0, -48.0), (-13.0, -48.0), and (-11.0, -48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden chests for storage at positions (4.5, -58.5), (-14.5, -50.5), (-13.5, -50.5), (-12.5, -50.5), (-11.5, -50.5), (-10.5, -50.5), (-9.5, -50.5), (-8.5, -50.5), (-7.5, -50.5), (-6.5, -50.5).\n- Iron chests at positions (-6.5, -50.5) and (-5.5, -50.5) for additional storage.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors due to Full Chests\n- Ensure that chests used for storage have sufficient space to accommodate new items. Regularly check and clear full chests to maintain production flow.\n\n### Warnings from Burner Mining Drill\n- The burner mining drill at position (4.0, -60.0) has a warning indicating that the chest at the drop position (4.5, -58.5) is full. Empty the chest to continue mining operations.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- No utility functions have been defined by the agent in the provided steps.\n- Important variables:\n  - `coal`: Inventory type, used as fuel for mining drills and furnaces.\n  - `iron-ore`: Inventory type, extracted and processed into iron plates.\n  - `iron-plate`: Inventory type, produced from smelting iron ore.\n  - `iron-gear-wheel`: Inventory type, presumably crafted from iron plates."}
