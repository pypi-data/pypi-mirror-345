{"content": "The persistent `NameError` indicating that `random` is not defined suggests that there might be an issue with how the environment is handling imports. Here are a few steps to troubleshoot and resolve this issue:\n\n1. **Ensure the Import is at the Top**: The import statement for the `random` module should be at the very top of your script. This ensures that the module is available throughout the script.\n\n2. **Check the Environment**: If the import is correctly placed and the error persists, there might be an issue with the environment itself. Ensure that the environment supports standard Python imports. If you have access to environment settings, verify that there are no restrictions on importing modules.\n\n3. **Use Alternative Methods**: If the environment still does not recognize the `random` module, you might need to use a workaround. For example, you could manually define a simple random function using basic operations if the environment supports it.\n\n4. **Test with a Simple Script**: Create a minimal script to test the import functionality:\n   ```python\n   import random\n\n   def test_random():\n       return random.uniform(-10, 10)\n\n   print(test_random())\n   ```\n   Run this script to see if the `random` module works in isolation.\n\n5. **Consult Documentation or Support**: If the problem persists, consult the documentation for the environment or reach out to support to understand any limitations or configurations that might affect module imports.\n\nIf none of these steps resolve the issue, consider providing more details about the environment or any specific configurations that might be affecting the execution.", "summary_range": "[1-364]"}
