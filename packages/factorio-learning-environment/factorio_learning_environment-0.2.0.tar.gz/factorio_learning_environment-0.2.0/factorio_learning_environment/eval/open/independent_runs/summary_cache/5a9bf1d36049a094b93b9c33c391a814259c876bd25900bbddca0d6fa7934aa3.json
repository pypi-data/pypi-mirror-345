{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) mining iron ore. It is currently out of fuel and its output is blocked.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) intended to collect mined iron ore. The chest is empty and in normal status.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-10.0, y=-50.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates. It is currently out of fuel and lacks ingredients to smelt.\n- **Burner Inserters**:\n  - At position (x=-15.5, y=-53.5), waiting for source items, out of fuel.\n  - At position (x=-13.5, y=-52.5), waiting for source items, out of fuel.\n  - At position (x=-9.5, y=-48.5), waiting for source items, out of fuel, connected to the stone furnace.\n\n### Transportation System\n- **Belt Group** connecting various parts of the facility:\n  - Inputs: Belt from (x=-16.5, y=-54.5) to (x=-14.5, y=-54.5), direction RIGHT.\n  - Outputs: Belt from (x=-12.5, y=-54.5) to (x=-10.5, y=-54.5), direction RIGHT.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Placing Wooden Chest\n- Ensure there is a clear and suitable position for placing the wooden chest. Avoid placing it on occupied tiles or areas with obstructions.\n\n### Iron Ore Supply Issues\n- Verify the connection between the mining drill and the chest to ensure iron ore can be transported effectively. Check for any blockages or misalignments in the transportation system.\n\n### Fuel Management Errors\n- Regularly check and refuel all entities that require fuel, such as burner mining drills, inserters, and furnaces, to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Inventory Inspection Errors\n- Ensure that the entity you are trying to inspect exists at the specified coordinates. Double-check the position and entity status before attempting to access its inventory.\n\n### Inserter and Furnace Fuel Errors\n- Ensure sufficient coal is available in your inventory before attempting to refuel inserters or furnaces. Plan ahead to maintain a steady supply of fuel."}
