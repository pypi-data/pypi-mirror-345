Check the target location for obstructions.\n- Verify that you have the required pipes in your inventory before attempting to place them.\n- Ensure that underground pipes are correctly aligned and within the connection range to successfully connect them.\n\n### Errors Related to Entity Status\n- For entities like the steam engine and boiler, ensure they are connected to the necessary inputs and outputs to function correctly.\n- Make sure the electricity network is correctly set up and entities are plugged into it to avoid NOT_PLUGGED_IN_ELECTRIC_NETWORK status.\n\n### General Placement Errors\n- Avoid attempting to place entities in occupied tiles. Check the tile's status before placing new entities."}
