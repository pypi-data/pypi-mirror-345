{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 19.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (-5.5, 19.5)\n- Boiler at position (-2.5, 24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe Group connecting these components, including positions such as (-4.5, 16.5) and (-9.5, 23.5)\n- Small Electric Poles at positions (-7.5, 21.5), (-7.5, 20.5), (-7.5, 22.5), (-1.5, 20.5), and (-6.5, 22.5)\n\n### Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Entities\n- Ensure that pipes are correctly aligned and connected between entities such as the offshore pump and boiler. Verify that the connection path is clear and that the correct entity types are being used for connections.\n\n### Errors with Inventory Management\n- Before attempting to insert items into entities like the boiler, verify that the required items (e.g., coal) are available in the inventory.\n\n### Errors with Undefined Variables\n- Ensure that all variables and entities, such as 'electricity_group', are properly defined before use. Double-check for typos or incorrect variable names.\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities\n- Verify that there are enough items in the inventory before attempting to place entities like small electric poles. Ensure that the placement position is valid and not occupied by another entity.\n\n### Errors with Electricity Network\n- Make sure that the electricity network is properly connected and that all poles are linked to the power grid to avoid issues with entities not being plugged into the electric network."}
