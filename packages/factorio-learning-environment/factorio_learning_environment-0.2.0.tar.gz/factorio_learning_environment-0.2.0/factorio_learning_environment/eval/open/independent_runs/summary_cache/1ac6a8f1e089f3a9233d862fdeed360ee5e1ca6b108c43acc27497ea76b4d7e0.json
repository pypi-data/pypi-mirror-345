{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and deposits it into the adjacent wooden chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the stone furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0): Smelts iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Insufficient Fuel Errors\n- Ensure that you have enough coal in your inventory to refuel all necessary entities like mining drills, inserters, and furnaces. Regularly check and replenish coal supplies to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Furnace Production Stoppage\n- Verify that the furnace has the required ingredients (iron ore) to smelt. Ensure that the inserter is correctly positioned and fueled to transfer iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n\n### Chest Capacity Management\n- Regularly extract items from the chest to prevent it from becoming full, which can halt the mining drill's operation. Consider expanding storage capacity or frequently managing the inventory to avoid stoppages.\n\n### Inserter Alignment\n- Ensure that inserters are correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items between entities effectively. Regularly check the alignment to prevent disruptions in the production chain."}
