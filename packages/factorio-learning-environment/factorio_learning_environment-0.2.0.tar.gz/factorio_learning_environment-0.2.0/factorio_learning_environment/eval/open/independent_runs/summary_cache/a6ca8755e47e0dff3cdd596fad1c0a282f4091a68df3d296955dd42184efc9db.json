{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Plate Smelting Setup at Position(x=52.0, y=-79.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=52.0, y=-79.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=53.5, y=-79.5) out of fuel.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=54.5, y=-79.5) containing iron plates.\n\n#### Iron Ore Mining Setup at Position(x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) out of fuel and with a full chest at the drop position.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) empty.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) waiting for source items.\n\n#### Coal Storage Setup at Position(x=41.5, y=-80.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=41.5, y=-80.5) empty.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=43.5, y=-80.5) containing coal.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=42.5, y=-80.5) waiting for source items.\n\n#### General Storage Setup at Position(x=0.5, y=0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=0.5, y=0.5) containing various items including coal, iron ore, and iron plates.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=1.5, y=0.5) containing coal and iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=2.5, y=0.5) containing coal.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=3.5, y=0.5) containing coal.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=4.5, y=0.5) containing coal and iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=5.5, y=0.5) containing iron ore and iron plates.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Mining Drill Not Working\n- **Error**: The mining drill at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) is not working due to being out of fuel and a full chest at the drop position.\n- **Tip**: Ensure the mining drill has fuel and that the chest at the drop position is not full. Empty the chest or provide additional storage to allow the drill to continue mining.\n\n#### Burner Inserter Out of Fuel\n- **Error**: The burner inserter at position (x=53.5, y=-79.5) is out of fuel.\n- **Tip**: Provide coal or other fuel to the burner inserter to allow it to function properly.\n\n#### Furnace Has No Ingredients\n- **Error**: The stone furnace at position (x=52.0, y=-79.0) has no ingredients to smelt.\n- **Tip**: Ensure that the furnace is supplied with the necessary raw materials (e.g., iron ore) and fuel to begin smelting.\n\n#### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- **Error**: The burner inserter at position (x=42.5, y=-80.5) is waiting for source items.\n- **Tip**: Ensure that the inserter has access to the items it needs to transfer. Check the source chest for items and the inserter's configuration.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n#### Utility Functions\n- **None defined yet**\n\n#### Important Variables\n- **None assigned yet**"}
