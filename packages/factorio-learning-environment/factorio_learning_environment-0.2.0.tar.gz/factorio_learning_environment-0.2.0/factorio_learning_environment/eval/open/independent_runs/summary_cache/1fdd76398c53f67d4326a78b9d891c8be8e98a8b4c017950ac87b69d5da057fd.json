Repeated repositioning of the inserter at (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) indicates alignment issues. Verify the pickup and drop positions to ensure they are correct.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Iron Ore\n- The furnace is not receiving iron ore due to incorrect inserter setup or misalignment. Check that the inserter is properly configured to transfer iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n\n### Errors with Inventory Management\n- Ensure that there is enough coal in your inventory before attempting to refuel entities. An error occurred due to attempting to insert coal when none was available in the inventory. Regularly check and manage your inventory to prevent such issues."}
