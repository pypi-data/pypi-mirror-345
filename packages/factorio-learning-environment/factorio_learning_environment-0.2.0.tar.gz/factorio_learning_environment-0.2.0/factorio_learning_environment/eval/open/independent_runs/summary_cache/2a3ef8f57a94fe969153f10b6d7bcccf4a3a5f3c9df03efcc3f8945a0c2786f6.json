{"content": "I'll create a new report based on the execution logs provided:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n###Coal Mining and Storage System (around x=41, y=-82)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (x=41.0, y=-82.0) mining coal\n- Primary wooden chest for coal storage (x=41.5, y=-80.5)\n- Burner inserter (x=42.5, y=-80.5) moving coal from chest to belt\n- Transport belt (x=43.5, y=-80.5) facing right\n- Two overflow iron chests for coal storage:\n  - First chest (x=41.5, y=-83.5)\n  - Second chest (x=41.5, y=-84.5)\n\n###Iron Smelting Setup (around x=45-49, y=-81)\nConsists of:\n- Two stone furnaces:\n  - First furnace (x=45.0, y=-81.0)\n  - Second furnace (x=47.0, y=-81.0)\n- Storage chest for iron plates (x=49.5, y=-80.5)\n\n###Transport Belt System\n- Main belt group running vertically from y=-68.5 to y=-77.5 at x=42.5\n- Additional belt segment at x=43.5, y=-80.5 facing right\n\nERROR TIPS\n1. Entity Placement Conflicts\n   - Always check if target location is clear before placing entities\n   - Verify there are no overlapping entities or terrain restrictions (like water)\n   - When placing inserters, ensure the entire working area (pickup and drop positions) is clear\n\n2. Inventory Management\n   - Monitor chest capacities before attempting to insert items\n   - Create overflow storage before chests become full\n   - Implement a storage management system to handle excess resources\n\n3. Belt Management\n   - Clear blocked belts before attempting to extract items\n   - Verify belt contents before attempting item extraction\n   - Ensure proper belt connectivity and flow\n\n4. Resource Availability\n   - Check inventory for required items before placement attempts\n   - Maintain a buffer of commonly used building materials\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nFunctions:\n- place_entity(): Places entities on the map\n  Success: When target location is clear and has required items\n  Failure: When location is blocked or missing required items\n\n- extract_item(): Extracts items from entities\n  Success: When target entity contains requested items\n  Failure: When items not found or inventory full\n\nImportant Variables:\n- storage_chest: EntityReference (wooden-chest/iron-chest)\n- furnace_inserter: EntityReference (burner-inserter)\n- belt_right: EntityReference (transport-belt)"}
