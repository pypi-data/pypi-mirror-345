{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Operation at (-10, -59)\nConsists of following entities:\n- 3 Burner mining drills in a row at positions (-10, -59), (-8, -59), (-6, -59)\n- 3 Collection chests at positions (-9.5, -57.5), (-7.5, -57.5), (-5.5, -57.5)\nCurrently all drills are out of fuel but mining from iron ore patch (40000 units each)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line at (0, 0)\nConsists of following entities:\n- 4 Stone furnaces in a row at positions (0, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), (6, 0)\n- 4 Coal supply chests at positions (0.5, -2.5), (2.5, -2.5), (4.5, -2.5), (6.5, -2.5)\n- 4 Coal feeding inserters at positions (0.5, -1.5), (2.5, -1.5), (4.5, -1.5), (6.5, -1.5)\n- 4 Iron plate collection chests at positions (0.5, 2.5), (2.5, 2.5), (4.5, 2.5), (6.5, 2.5)\n- 4 Iron plate extracting inserters at positions (0.5, 1.5), (2.5, 1.5), (4.5, 1.5), (6.5, 1.5)\n\nThe furnaces are fueled with coal and producing iron plates that are being moved to collection chests by inserters.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Fuel Management Issues\n- Ensure you have coal in inventory before attempting to insert fuel into entities\n- Keep track of fuel levels in mining drills to prevent them from running out of fuel and stopping production\n\n### Entity Placement Considerations\n- When restructuring systems, verify that new entities are properly aligned with existing ones\n- Ensure inserters are placed in correct orientation relative to source and target entities\n\n### Resource Management\n- Monitor iron ore supply chain from mining drills to furnaces to maintain continuous production\n- Keep coal supply chests stocked to prevent production interruptions"}
