{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining Operation at (-15, -15)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (24.0, -15.0) mining coal\n- Wooden chest at (23.5, -16.5) storing coal (125 units)\n\n### Iron Mining Operation at (-14, 23)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-14.0, 23.0) mining iron ore\n- Wooden chest at (-14.5, 21.5) storing iron ore (639 units)\n\n### Copper Processing Line at (20, 20)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (20.0, 20.0) mining copper ore\n- Input wooden chest at (20.5, 21.5) storing copper ore (5 units)\n- Middle wooden chest at (22.5, 21.5) storing copper ore (423 units)\n- Stone furnace at (24.0, 20.0)\n- Output wooden chest at (24.5, 17.5) storing copper plates (53 units)\n- Burner inserter at (24.5, 18.5) moving items from furnace to output chest\n- Burner inserter at (22.5, 22.5) attempting to feed furnace from middle chest\n\n### Unused Furnaces\nTwo stone furnaces at:\n- (-11.0, 20.0)\n- (-9.0, 20.0)\nBoth currently without ingredients\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Placement Issues\n- Ensure inserters are placed with correct orientation and valid pickup/drop positions\n- When placing inserters, verify there is a valid destination entity at the drop position\n- Current issue: Furnace input inserter at (22.5, 22.5) has no valid destination entity at its drop position (22.5, 23.5)\n\n### Furnace Operation Issues\n- Multiple furnaces are idle due to lack of ingredients despite available resources nearby\n- Ensure proper connection between storage chests, inserters, and furnaces\n- Verify the complete input-output chain is properly connected before expecting production\n\n### Resource Management\n- Some furnaces have excess fuel (furnace at 24.0, 20.0 has \"furnace fuel source is full\" warning)\n- Consider balancing fuel distribution more efficiently across machines"}
