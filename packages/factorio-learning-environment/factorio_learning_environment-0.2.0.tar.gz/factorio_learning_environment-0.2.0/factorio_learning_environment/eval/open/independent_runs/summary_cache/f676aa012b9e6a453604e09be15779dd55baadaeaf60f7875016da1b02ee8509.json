{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Steam Engine** at position (x=17.5, y=20.5), currently not connected due to no input liquid and no fluid present in connections.\n- **Boiler** at position (x=1.5, y=23.0), currently out of fuel, with water fluid box containing 200 units at 15\u00b0C, connected via pipes.\n- **Offshore Pump** at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5), working status, providing water to the system with a fluid box containing 100 units at 15\u00b0C.\n\n### Pipe Network\n- **PipeGroup** for fluid system 14971, starting at position (x=3.5, y=17.5), currently empty.\n- **PipeGroup** for fluid system 14982, starting at position (x=-9.5, y=23.5), currently full output, transporting water.\n\n### Electricity Network\n- **ElectricityGroup** with poles distributed at various positions including (x=14.5, y=20.5), (x=35.5, y=20.5), and others, currently with 0 voltage.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure that the entities you are trying to connect with pipes are compatible and correctly aligned. Check for any obstructions or misalignments that might prevent a successful connection.\n\n### Errors when Placing Electric Poles\n- Before attempting to place an electric pole, verify that there is a suitable position available. Consider clearing any obstacles or selecting a different location if no suitable position is found.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- **connect_entities**: This function attempts to connect entities using pipes. It failed due to incompatible or misaligned entities between the boiler and steam engine.\n\n### Important Variables\n- **pipes**: List of connected pipes between entities, type: List[Entity].\n- **boiler**: Represents the boiler entity, type: Entity.\n- **steam_engine**: Represents the steam engine entity, type: Entity."}
