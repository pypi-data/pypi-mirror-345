{"content": "The error indicates that crafting a `Boiler` failed because the intermediate component, `Stone`, is missing and needs to be gathered as a raw resource. Let's address this by gathering the necessary stone and then proceeding with crafting.\n\n### Steps to Resolve:\n\n1. **Gather Stone**: Locate and harvest stone from the nearest stone resource.\n2. **Craft Intermediate Components**: Use the gathered stone to craft a `Stone Furnace`, which is needed for the `Boiler`.\n3. **Craft the Boiler**: Once the `Stone Furnace` is available, craft the `Boiler`.\n4. **Proceed with Power Setup**: Place the `Offshore Pump`, `Boiler`, and `Steam Engine`, and connect them to the assembling machine.\n\nHere's how you can implement these steps:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Gather Stone\nstone_position = nearest(Resource.Stone)\nmove_to(stone_position)\nharvest_resource(stone_position, quantity=10)  # Adjust quantity as needed\n\n# Step 2: Craft Stone Furnace\ncraft_item(Prototype.StoneFurnace, 1)\n\n# Step 3: Craft Boiler\ncraft_item(Prototype.Boiler, 1)\n\n# Step 4: Craft Steam Engine if not already crafted\ncraft_item(Prototype.SteamEngine, 1)\n\n# Step 5: Move to the water location and place the Offshore Pump\nwater_pos = nearest(Resource.Water)\nmove_to(water_pos)\n\noffshore_pump = place_entity(Prototype.OffshorePump, position=water_pos)\n\n# Step 6: Place the Boiler and Steam Engine and connect them\nboiler_position = water_pos.down()\nboiler = place_entity_next_to(Prototype.Boiler, reference_position=offshore_pump.position, direction=Direction.DOWN, spacing=0)\n\nsteam_engine_position = boiler.position.down()\nsteam_engine = place_entity_next_to(Prototype.SteamEngine, reference_position=boiler.position, direction=Direction.DOWN, spacing=0)\n\n# Step 7: Connect the Steam Engine to assembling machine via poles\npole_position = nearest(Prototype.SmallElectricPole)\nconnect_entities(steam_engine_position, pole_position)\nconnect_entities(pole_position, assembling_machine_position)\n\n# Review the final inventory and system state\nfinal_inventory = inspect_inventory()\nprint(f\"Final Inventory After Crafting and Setup: {final_inventory}\")\nprint(f\"Entities on the Map: {get_entities()}\")\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- **Gathering Resources**: Ensure you gather enough stone before attempting to craft the `Stone Furnace`.\n- **Crafting Order**: Craft intermediate components before the final product.\n- **Power Setup**: Ensure all components are connected properly to provide power to the assembling machine.\n\nThis approach should help resolve the issue and successfully set up the power system for the assembling machine.", "summary_range": "[1-118]"}
