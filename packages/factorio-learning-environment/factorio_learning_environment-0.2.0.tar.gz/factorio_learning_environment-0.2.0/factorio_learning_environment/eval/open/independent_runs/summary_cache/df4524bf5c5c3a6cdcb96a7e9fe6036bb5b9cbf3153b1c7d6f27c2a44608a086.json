{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Fuel: Coal\n  - Connected to a wooden chest\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Contains: Iron ore (736 units)\n  - Connected to a burner inserter\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-15.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Status: Waiting for source items\n  - Fuel: Coal\n  - Pickup position: (x=-16.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Drop position: (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the furnace\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\n  - Status: No ingredients\n  - Fuel: Coal\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Alignment Errors\n- Ensure that the inserter's pickup position is aligned with the chest's position. The pickup position should match the chest's position to avoid misalignment errors.\n\n### Inserter Fueling Errors\n- Ensure that the inserter has sufficient fuel to operate. Refuel the inserter with coal to maintain its operation.\n\n### Furnace Ingredient Supply Errors\n- Verify that the furnace is receiving the necessary ingredients (iron ore) for smelting. Check the inserter setup to ensure it is correctly transferring items from the chest to the furnace.\n\n### Inventory Management Errors\n- Ensure that there is enough coal in the inventory for refueling operations. Harvest additional coal if necessary to maintain a steady supply for machines.\n\n### General Placement and Positioning Tips\n- Double-check the positioning of entities to ensure they are correctly aligned and connected. Misplaced entities can disrupt the production flow and cause operational inefficiencies."}
