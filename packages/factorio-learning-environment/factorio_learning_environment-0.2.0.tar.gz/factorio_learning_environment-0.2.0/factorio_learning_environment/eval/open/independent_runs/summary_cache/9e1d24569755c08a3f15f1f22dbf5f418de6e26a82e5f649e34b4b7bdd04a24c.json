{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) with sufficient fuel, extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) and (x=-15.5, y=-48.5) used for storing iron ore.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (x=-12.0, y=-48.0) and (x=-10.0, y=-48.0), both with sufficient fuel, used for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserters**:\n  - At position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5), transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace at (x=-12.0, y=-48.0).\n  - At position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5), transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace at (x=-10.0, y=-48.0).\n  - At position (x=-8.5, y=-47.5), transferring iron plates from the furnace at (x=-10.0, y=-48.0) to the output chest.\n- **Output Chest** at position (x=-7.5, y=-47.5), storing the produced iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source chests or entities have sufficient items for the inserters to operate. Regularly check and refill the source entities to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Inserters Waiting for Space in Destination\n- Monitor the destination entities (such as furnaces or chests) to ensure they have enough space to receive items from inserters. Clear out or upgrade storage as necessary to prevent bottlenecks.\n\n### Source Entities Running Out of Resources\n- Regularly supply resources to the source entities like mining drills and chests to prevent production halts. Consider setting up a logistics system to automate resource supply.\n\n### Furnace Belt Blocked\n- Ensure that the output belts or inserters from furnaces have a clear path and sufficient space in their destination to prevent blockage. Regularly clear or upgrade the output path to maintain efficiency."}
