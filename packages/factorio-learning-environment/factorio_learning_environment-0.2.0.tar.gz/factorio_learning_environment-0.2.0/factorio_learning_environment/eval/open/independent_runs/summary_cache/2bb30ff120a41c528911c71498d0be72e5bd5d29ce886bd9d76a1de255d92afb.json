{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Electricity generator at position(x=5.5, y=0.5)\nConsists of steam engine(position x=5.5, y=0.5), offshore pump (position x=-7.5, y=25.5) and pipes connecting them.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(x=52.0, y=-84.0)\nConsists of following entities\n-  Furnace (position x=52.0, y=-84.0) \n-  Furnace (position x=52.0, y=-82.0) \n-  Furnace (position x=52.0, y=-80.0) \n-  Furnace (position x=62.0, y=-54.0) \n\n### Copper cable factory\nNo structures found related to copper cable factory.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n### Errors when placing pipes\n-  Ensure you are close enough to the target position to place the pipe. Move closer to the target position before attempting to place the pipe.\n-  Ensure the target position is not occupied by another entity before attempting to place the pipe. Remove any existing entities at the target position before continuing.\n-  Ensure there are no existing objects in the way of the target position. Clear any obstacles before attempting to place the pipe.\n\n### Errors when connecting entities\n-  Make sure the entities are compatible and can be connected.\n-  Ensure the entities are close enough to each other to be connected.\n-  Ensure the pipe group connected to the offshore pump and steam engine are the same.\n\n### Errors when using API\n-  Check the API documentation to ensure correct usage of functions.\n-  Ensure all required parameters are provided when calling API functions.\n-  Handle any exceptions that may be thrown by API functions."}
