{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position (0, 0)\nConsists of:\n- Steam engine at position (0, 1)\n- Boiler at position (0, 2)\n- Offshore pump at position (0, 3)\n\n### Copper plate mine at position (1, 0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at position (1, 1) and a furnace at position (1, 2)\n- Burner mining drill at position (1, 3) and a furnace at position (1, 4)\n- Burner mining drill at position (1, 5) and a furnace at position (1, 6)\n\n### Copper cable factory at position (2, 0)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine at position (2, 1) and inserter at position (2, 2) that puts into assembling machine\n- Beltgroup that connects the furnace at position (1, 2) to assembling machine at position (2, 1)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when crafting items due to insufficient ingredients\n- Ensure you have enough raw materials in your inventory before attempting to craft items. For example, crafting an iron gear wheel requires iron plates, which must be available.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it. Check for existing entities in the intended position.\n\n### Errors when trying to craft without a crafting machine or furnace\n- Verify that you are using the correct crafting machine or furnace for the recipe you are attempting to craft."}
