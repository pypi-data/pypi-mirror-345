Consists of multiple pipes including segments near (x=-8.5, y=-0.5) and (x=-2.5, y=2.5).\n*   **Pipe Network 2** (Fluid: steam) connects the Boiler output to the Steam Engine input. Consists of multiple pipes including segments near (x=-0.5, y=4.5) and (x=0.5, y=2.5).\n\n### Automated Coal Mining and Delivery\n*   **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=16.0, y=0.0) mines coal.\n    *   Fueled initially with 20 coal.\n*   **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-1.5, y=6.5) is intended"}
