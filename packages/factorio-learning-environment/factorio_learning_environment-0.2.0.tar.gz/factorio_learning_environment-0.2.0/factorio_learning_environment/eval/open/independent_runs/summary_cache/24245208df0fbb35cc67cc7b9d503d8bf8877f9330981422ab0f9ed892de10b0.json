{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-12.0, -48.0) and (-10.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) for extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-14.5, -48.5) and (-15.5, -48.5) for storing iron ore.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (-12.0, -48.0) and (-10.0, -48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserters** at positions (-13.5, -48.5), (-14.5, -47.5), and (-8.5, -47.5) for transferring materials between entities.\n- **Output Chest** at position (-7.5, -47.5) for storing produced iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Operations\n- Ensure that inserters have a clear path to both source and destination items. Avoid placing inserters where the destination is blocked or where there are no source items available.\n\n### Errors with Resource Supply\n- Regularly check and ensure that all sources, such as chests and drills, have sufficient resources to avoid interruptions in production."}
