{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (46.0, -82.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace at position (46.0, -82.0)\n- Wooden chest at position (47.5, -81.5) collecting iron plates from the furnace\nUse-case: Processes iron ore into iron plates. The structure now integrates a collection point (wooden chest) for iron plates from the furnace, facilitating direct resource storage and management.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to insufficient production output and delayed processing\n- Verify that the processing cycle receives adequate time to complete so that sufficient outputs are available.\n- Adjust timing or processing cycles to ensure production output meets extraction requirements.\n\n### Errors when inserting items despite resource unavailability\n- Confirm that the inventory contains the intended resource prior to attempting insertion.\n- Double-check inventory levels to prevent actions using absent resources.\n\n### Errors when extracting items from an entity lacking sufficient output\n- Ensure the target production structure has sufficient output before extraction.\n- Validate that the extraction target contains the intended resource, and avoid extraction attempts when inventories are low."}
