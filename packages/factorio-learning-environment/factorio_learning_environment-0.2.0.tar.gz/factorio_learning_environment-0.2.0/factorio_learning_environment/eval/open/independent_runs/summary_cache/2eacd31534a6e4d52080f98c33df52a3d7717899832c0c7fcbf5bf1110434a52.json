Subsequent copper-plate extractions have reduced its furnace result inventory (currently showing \u224814 copper plates) while its status remains NO_FUEL with warning [\"out of fuel\"].\n\n### Automation Lab & Steam Power System (Integrated System)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab at position (x=-7.5, y=18.5) used for automation research.\n- Boiler at position (x=-5.5, y=24.0) used for steam production. After recent supplemental fueling (20 coal added), its fuel inventory shows coal count 17, energy is 2000.0, and its status is now WORKING. Connection points are at (x=-7.5, y=24.5) and (x=-3.5, y=24.5).\n- Generator (Steam Engine) at position (x=-0.5, y=24.5) converting steam into electrical power. Following reconnection attempts and supplemental steam production, it now has an energy level of 14958.33, status WORKING, and connection points at (x=-0.5, y=22.0) and (x=-0.5, y=27.0). Its fluid box now contains steam (amount \u2248133.52, temperature 165).\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-7.5, y=25.5) supplying water.\n- Electricity Group providing power connectivity via small electric poles (historically placed at positions such as (x=-0.5, y=11.5), (x=-4.5, y=15.5), (x=0.5, y=14.5), (x=-5.5, y=18.5), (x=-8.5, y=21.5) and (x=-2.5, y=24.5)).\n- Pipe Groups forming the fluid network:\n   \u2022 PipeGroup (fluid_system=2144) at position (x=-10.5, y=16.5) with pipes at its coordinates (status: EMPTY).\n   \u2022 PipeGroup (fluid_system=2145) at position (x=-12.5, y=18.5) (status: EMPTY).\n   \u2022 PipeGroup (fluid_system=2147, fluid=water) at position (x=-8.5, y=20.5) with pipes at its coordinates (status: FULL_OUTPUT).\n   \u2022 PipeGroup (fluid_system=2149, fluid=steam) at position (x=-2.5, y=21.5) with pipes at its coordinates (status: WORKING).\n\n### Copper Cable Factory at position (x=1.5, y=19.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- AssemblingMachine1 at position (x=1.5, y=19.5) configured with the copper-cable recipe. After several rounds of copper-plate insertions, its latest status is FULL_OUTPUT though it still warns with [\"cannot create copper-cable due to missing resources: copper-plate (1)\"]. Its electrical connection identifier has been updated to 1593.\n- Neighbouring Small Electric Poles providing power connectivity at positions (x=-0.5, y=17.5), (x=-0.5, y=19.5) and (x=3.5, y=19.5). An associated pipe at position (x=-0.5, y=21.5) is also listed among its neighbours.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n- AssemblingMachine1 Placement Failures:\n  \u2022 Ensure the target build area is free of obstructions and collisions. Verify adequate spacing and adjust placement direction to avoid interference with existing structures.\n  \n- Recipe Setting Errors:\n  \u2022 Confirm that the deployed assembler\u2019s reference is correctly assigned before attempting to set recipes to avoid undefined variable issues.\n  \n- Nearest Buildable Area Search Issues:\n  \u2022 Always treat position objects as data and ensure that any computed center positions are defined and accessible.\n  \n- Ingredient Supply Timing Error:\n  \u2022 Synchronize copper-plate extraction from the smelting furnace and insertion into the assembling machine to ensure that its input inventory is promptly replenished.\n  \n- Power Connectivity Issues:\n  \u2022 Re-examine the electrical grid integration and verify that all added electric poles are properly connected to a functioning power network.\n  \n- Fluid Connection Errors between Boiler and Generator:\n  \u2022 Confirm that both the Boiler\u2019s and the Steam Engine\u2019s connection points are unblocked and properly aligned. Ensure that the target entity is able to receive fluid and that adjacent tiles are available for securing pipe connections."}
