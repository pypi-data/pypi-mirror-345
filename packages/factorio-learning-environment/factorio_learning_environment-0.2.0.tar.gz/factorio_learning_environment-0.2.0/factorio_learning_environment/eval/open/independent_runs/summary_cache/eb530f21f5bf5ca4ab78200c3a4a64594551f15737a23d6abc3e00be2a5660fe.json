{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-0.5, -9.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam engine (position -0.5, -9.5)\n- Boiler (position -4.5, 23.0)\n- Offshore pump (position -10.5, 25.5)\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 0, 0) and a furnace at position(0, 0)\n- Burner mining drill (position 5, 5) and a furnace at position(5, 5)\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine at position(z1) and inserter at position(a) that puts into assembling machine\n- Beltgroup (position) that connects the furnace at position y1 to assembling machine at position(z1)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to connection issues\n- Ensure that the offshore pump is connected to a fluid source before attempting to connect it to the boiler and steam engine.\n- Check for any placement blockages that may prevent pipes from connecting. Clear any obstructing entities or pipes before attempting to connect.\n\n### Errors when using electric networks\n- Make sure that all entities requiring power are connected to the electric network. Verify the positions of electric poles and ensure they are within range of the entities needing power.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity in a tile before attempting to place it. Check for existing entities in the target tile that may block placement."}
