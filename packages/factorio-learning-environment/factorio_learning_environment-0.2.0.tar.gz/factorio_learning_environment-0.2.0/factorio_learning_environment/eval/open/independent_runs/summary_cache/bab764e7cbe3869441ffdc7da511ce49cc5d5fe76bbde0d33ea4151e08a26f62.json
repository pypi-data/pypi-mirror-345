{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Cable Factory at position (2.5, 17.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n\u2013 Cable factory input chest at Position(x=2.5, y=17.5)\n\u2013 Burner inserter at Position(x=3.5, y=17.5) placed using direction RIGHT (drop position at Position(x=4.5, y=17.5))\n\u2013 Additional burner inserters forming part of the connected network:\n\u2003\u2022 Burner inserter at Position(x=1.5, y=17.5) (with coal fuel and linked via a nearby transport belt at Position(x=0.5, y=17.5))\n\u2003\u2022 Burner inserter at Position(x=2.5, y=16.5) (with pickup at Position(x=2.5, y=17.5) and drop at Position(x=2.5, y=15.5))\n\u2013 Assembling machine at Position(x=1.5, y=19.5) that receives items via these inserters\n\nUse case: This structure is designed to feed and process materials for copper-cable production.\n\n### Depot Belt System at position (3.5, 15.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n\u2013 Wooden chest (belt depot) at Position(x=3.5, y=15.5)\n\u2013 Dedicated transport belt segment at Position(x=4.5, y=15.5) installed adjacent to the depot chest\n\u2013 Depot burner inserter at Position(x=3.5, y=14.5) placed using direction UP, serving as the interface for item retrieval\n\nUse case: This system is intended to channel outputs from the extraction system into a stable depot for downstream processing.\n\n### Electricity Generator at position (-0.5, 24.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n\u2013 Steam engine (generator) at Position(x=-0.5, y=24.5)\n\u2013 Boiler at Position(x=-5.5, y=24.0)\n\u2013 Offshore pump at Position(x=-7.5, y=25.5)\n\nUse case: This structure provides electrical power for connected facilities.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n\u2022 Transport Belt Connection Issues\n\u2003\u2013 Transport belts must not be attached directly to a steam engine (Prototype.SteamEngine). Always add and use an inserter that can feed items into the power-producing unit to serve as the connection target.\n\n\u2022 Entity Placement Distance\n\u2003\u2013 When receiving errors about target positions being too far (e.g. wooden chest placement at Position(3.5,15.5)), ensure that the player is moved within the maximum allowable placement distance before attempting to place the entity.\n\n\u2022 Inventory Availability\n\u2003\u2013 Before attempting to place an entity (such as a wooden chest), verify that the required item is present in the inventory to avoid placement failures.\n\n\u2022 Variable Naming Consistency\n\u2003\u2013 Errors such as \u201cname \u2018target_chest\u2019 is not defined\u201d indicate inconsistent variable naming. Double-check that all referenced variable names match the defined ones to prevent NameErrors."}
