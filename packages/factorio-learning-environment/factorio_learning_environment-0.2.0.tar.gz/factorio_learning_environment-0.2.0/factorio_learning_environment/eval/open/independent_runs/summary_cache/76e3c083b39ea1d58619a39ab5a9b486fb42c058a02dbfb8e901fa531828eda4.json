{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\nConsists of:\n- **Offshore Pump** at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\n- **Boiler** at Position (-44.5, -124.0)\n- **Steam Engine** at Position (-40.5, -113.5)\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at Position (-15.0, -76.0) connected to a **Wooden Chest** at Position (-15.5, -77.5)\n- **Stone Furnace** at Position (-19.0, -73.0)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- **Stone Furnace** at Position (9.0, -64.0)\n- **Stone Furnace** at Position (6.0, -62.0) with an **Inserter** at Position (6.5, -60.5) feeding into a **Wooden Chest** at Position (6.5, -59.5)\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of:\n- **Small Electric Poles** connecting various entities, including the **Steam Engine** and **Inserter**\n\n### Storage Facilities\nConsists of:\n- **Wooden Chest** at Position (7.5, -61.5)\n- **Wooden Chest** at Position (6.5, -59.5)\n\n### Pipe Networks\nMultiple **Pipe Groups** at various positions, such as:\n- Position (-36.5, -123.5)\n- Position (-48.5, -112.5)\n- Position (-37.5, -111.5)\n- Position (-42.5, -109.5)\n- Position (-0.5, 10.5)\n- Position (-0.5, 17.5)\n- Position (-12.5, 23.5)\n- Position (-5.5, 24.5)\n- Position (1.5, 24.5)\n- Position (2.5, 25.5)\n\n### Research Facility\nConsists of:\n- **Lab** with input for automation science packs, currently not powered.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors When Using Incorrect Argument Types\n- Ensure that when using `pickup_entity`, the second argument must be a `Position` object.\n\n### Attribute Errors with Custom Objects\n- Verify that custom objects like `ElectricityGroup` have the correct attributes before accessing them. For example, ensure that objects have a `prototype` attribute if you plan to use it.\n\n### Obstructions Near Offshore Pump\n- Clear any obstructing entities near the offshore pump to ensure proper functionality and connectivity.\n\n### Connectivity and Power Issues\n- Ensure that all entities requiring power are connected to a power source and that the power network is complete and functional."}
