{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Cable Factory Interface at Position(x=2.5, y=17.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n\u2013 Input Chest at Position(x=2.5, y=17.5) (serving as the factory interface)\n\u2013 Dedicated Burner Inserter placed at Position(x=3.5, y=17.5) using direction RIGHT\n\u2013 Connected Burner Inserter at Position(x=2.5, y=16.5) (listed as a neighbour)\n\u2013 Assembling Machine at Position(x=1.5, y=19.5) (receiving items via belt connection)\n\n### Depot Belt System at Position(x=3.5, y=15.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n\u2013 Wooden Chest placed as the belt depot at Position(x=3.5, y=15.5)\n\u2013 Transport Belt Segment placed adjacent at Position(x=4.5, y=15.5)\n\u2013 Dedicated Depot Burner Inserter placed at Position(x=3.5, y=14.5) using direction UP with a pickup position at (3.5, y=15.5) and a drop position at (3.5, y=13.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n\u2022 Transport Belt Connection Errors  \n\u2003\u2013 Do not attempt to connect transport belts directly to a Prototype.SteamEngine target. Always introduce an inserter that feeds items into the steam engine so that the belt connection targets a compatible inserter instead.\n\n\u2022 Entity Placement Distance Error  \n\u2003\u2013 Verify that target positions are within the allowable placement range. If a target position is too far (for example, a chest placement error occurred when the distance exceeded the maximum), move closer before attempting placement.\n\n\u2022 Inventory Shortage Error  \n\u2003\u2013 Confirm that the required item is present in the inventory before attempting placement. An error occurred when a wooden chest was not available for placement.\n\n\u2022 Undefined Variable Error  \n\u2003\u2013 Check and use the correct variable names when referencing target entities. An undefined variable (target_chest) was encountered instead of one of the defined names such as target_pos or depot_chest."}
