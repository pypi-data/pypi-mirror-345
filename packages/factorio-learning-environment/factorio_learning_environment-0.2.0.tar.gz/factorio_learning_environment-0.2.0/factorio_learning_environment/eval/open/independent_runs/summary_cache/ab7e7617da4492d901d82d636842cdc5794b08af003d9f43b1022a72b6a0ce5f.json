{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) with a drop position at (-14.5, -48.5), currently working with a warning that the chest at the drop position is full.\n- **Furnaces** at positions (-13.0, -48.0), (-11.0, -48.0), and (-9.0, -48.0), all working and smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Iron Chests** at positions (-18.5, -48.5), (-16.5, -48.5), (-15.5, -48.5), (-14.5, -47.5), and (-13.5, -49.5) for storage of iron ore and iron plates.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-14.5, -48.5), (-12.5, -49.5), and (-9.5, -49.5) for additional storage.\n- **Burner Inserters** and **Iron Chests** are used to transfer materials between entities.\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (41.0, -82.0) with a drop position at (41.5, -80.5), currently working with a warning that the chest at the drop position is full.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (43.0, -82.0) for smelting purposes.\n- **Iron Chests** at positions (41.5, -80.5), (42.5, -80.5), (44.5, -80.5), (45.5, -80.5), (47.5, -80.5), and (49.5, -80.5) for coal and iron plate storage.\n- **Burner Inserters** at positions (43.5, -80.5) for transferring coal and iron plates between entities.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (41.5, -79.5) for additional coal storage.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when extracting but being too far\n- Ensure you are close enough to the storage entity before attempting to extract items from it.\n\n### Errors when clearing drop chests\n- Make sure the drop chests are not full before attempting to clear them. Empty the contents if necessary to continue operations.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure the target tile is free of other entities before attempting to place a new entity there.\n\n### Errors when refueling or supplying materials\n- Verify that the entities you are refueling or supplying with materials have enough capacity to accept the items."}
