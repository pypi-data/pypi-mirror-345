{"content": "I notice from the output that the mining drill is showing a warning: \"waiting for space in destination as the output is full\". We need to place a chest to collect the output. Let's modify our approach:\n\n```python\n# First let's place a wooden chest next to the drill's output\ndrill = get_entities({Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill})[0]\nprint(f\"Found drill at {drill.position}\")\n\n# Place chest near drill's output\nchest = place_entity_next_to(\n    Prototype.WoodenChest,\n    reference_position=drill.drop_position,\n    direction=Direction.RIGHT\n)\nprint(f\"Placed chest at {chest.position}\")\n\n# Now place the inserter between drill and chest\ninserter = place_entity_next_to(\n    Prototype.BurnerInserter,\n    reference_position=drill.drop_position,\n    direction=Direction.RIGHT,\n    rotation=Direction.RIGHT  # Make sure it faces the right way\n)\nprint(f\"Placed inserter at {inserter.position}\")\n\n# Add fuel to the inserter\ninsert_item(Prototype.Coal, inserter, quantity=1)\nprint(\"Added fuel to inserter\")\n\n# Verify the setup\nprint(f\"Drill status: {drill.status}\")\nprint(f\"Inserter status: {inserter.status}\")\nprint(f\"Chest inventory: {inspect_inventory(chest)}\")\n```\n\nThe key changes are:\n1. Adding a wooden chest as the destination for the items\n2. Making sure the inserter is correctly oriented to move items from drill to chest\n3. Placing components in the right order: chest first, then inserter\n\nThis should create a working chain where:\n1. The drill mines iron ore\n2. The inserter picks up the iron ore\n3. The inserter places the iron ore into the chest", "summary_range": "[1-2890]"}
