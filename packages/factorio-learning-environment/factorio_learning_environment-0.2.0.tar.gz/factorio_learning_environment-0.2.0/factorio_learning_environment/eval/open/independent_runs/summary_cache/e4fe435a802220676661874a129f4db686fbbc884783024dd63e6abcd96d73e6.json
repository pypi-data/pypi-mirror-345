{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n--------------------\n### Extraction System at Position(-3.5, 27.5)\nConsists of the following entity:\n\u2013 Extraction system burner inserter at Position(-3.5, 27.5) with drop position Position(-3.5, 28.5)\n\u2003(Note: An associated wooden chest at Position(-3.5, 26.5) appears in the final map to buffer extracted items.)\n\n### Copper Cable Factory at Position(2.5, 17.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n\u2013 Input chest at Position(2.5, 17.5) serving as the copper plate intake  \n\u2013 Burner inserter at Position(3.5, 17.5) placed at the factory interface using direction RIGHT  \n\u2013 Burner inserter at Position(1.5, 17.5) feeding items into production  \n\u2013 Assembling machine at Position(1.5, 19.5) whose role is to produce copper cable\n\n### Depot Belt System at Position(3.5, 15.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n\u2013 Wooden chest (belt depot) at Position(3.5, 15.5) providing an isolated depot  \n\u2013 Transport belt segment at Position(4.5, 15.5) placed adjacent to the depot chest  \n\u2013 Depot burner inserter at Position(3.5, 14.5) (using direction UP) that is intended to receive items via the belt\n\nERROR TIPS\n----------\n\u2022 Transport belt connection target error  \n\u2003Ensure that transport belts are never connected directly to a Prototype.SteamEngine. Always add an inserter to serve as the proper target entity before making the belt connection.\n\n\u2022 Placement distance error  \n\u2003When placing entities such as wooden chests, verify that the target position is within maximum placement range. Move closer if the distance exceeds limits to avoid placement failure.\n\n\u2022 Inventory verification error  \n\u2003Before executing a placement command, check that the required item (for example, a wooden chest) is available in the inventory to prevent \u201cno \u2026 in inventory\u201d errors.\n\n\u2022 Variable reference error  \n\u2003Avoid referencing undefined variables (as with the \u201ctarget_chest\u201d issue). Confirm that all variable names are correctly defined and consistently used to prevent NameError incidents."}
