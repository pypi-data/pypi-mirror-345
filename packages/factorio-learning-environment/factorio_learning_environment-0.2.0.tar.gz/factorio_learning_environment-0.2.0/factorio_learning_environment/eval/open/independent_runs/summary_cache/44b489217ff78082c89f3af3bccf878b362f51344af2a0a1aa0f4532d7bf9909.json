{"content": "# Factorio Game Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=5.5, y=21.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=5.5, y=21.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=-1.5, y=24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine\n- Small Electric Poles connecting the steam engine to the lab\n\n### Lab at Position (x=2.5, y=0.5)\n- Lab is currently conducting Automation research\n- Connected to the electricity network via small electric poles\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with copper plates in the furnace result inventory\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Insufficient Materials\n- Ensure you have enough materials in your inventory before attempting to craft items. For example, copper plates and copper cables are needed for crafting copper cables and small electric poles, respectively.\n\n### Errors When Connecting Entities\n- Verify that you have the necessary items (e.g., pipes, electric poles) in your inventory before attempting to connect entities like steam engines, boilers, and labs.\n\n### Errors with Undefined Variables\n- Double-check your variable names and definitions to avoid NameError exceptions. Ensure all necessary variables are defined before use.\n\n### Errors with Entity Status Checks\n- Confirm that entities like steam engines are correctly set up and fueled before checking their status to avoid assertion errors.\n\n### Errors When Extracting or Inserting Items\n- Ensure that the target entity exists and contains the required items before attempting to extract or insert items to prevent extraction errors.\n\n### Errors with Lab Operations\n- Make sure that the lab is correctly placed and connected to the power grid to avoid errors related to lab status and research operations.\n\n### Errors Due to Insufficient Fuel\n- Regularly check your fuel levels, especially coal for boilers, to ensure continuous operation of your power generation setup."}
