{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-14.0, -53.0) connected to a **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -54.5) and another **Wooden Chest** at position (-12.5, -54.5). The drill is working, extracting iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -54.5) transferring items between the chests and the mining drill.\n- **Furnace** at position (-21.0, -62.0) with warnings of \"no ingredients to smelt\" and \"furnace fuel source is full\", indicating a need for input materials.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-23.0, -68.0) connected to a **Wooden Chest** at position (-23.5, -69.5) and another **Wooden Chest** at position (-24.5, -67.5). The drill is working, extracting copper ore.\n- **Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0) and another at position (5.0, 0.0), both with warnings of \"no ingredients to smelt\", indicating they are awaiting input materials.\n\n### Transport and Storage System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **BeltGroup** connecting a **Wooden Chest** at position (1.5, 0.5) to an **Inserter** at position (2.5, 0.5), facilitating the movement of items along the belt.\n- Multiple **Wooden Chests** scattered across various positions, storing resources like copper ore, iron ore, and coal.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Attribute Errors with Object Properties\n- Ensure that the properties you are trying to access on an object exist. For example, the 'Chest' object does not have a 'pickup_position' attribute. Verify object properties before accessing them.\n\n### Inserter and Furnace Warnings\n- Address warnings such as \"inserter waiting for source items\" and \"no ingredients to smelt\" by ensuring that the necessary input materials are available for processing entities like inserters and furnaces.\n\n### Full Inventory Warnings\n- Regularly check and manage inventories to prevent full storage warnings, which can halt production processes. For example, the chest at position (52.5, -84.5) is full, preventing further mining.\n\n### Output Blockage\n- Ensure that output paths are clear and that there is a sink entity to accept outputs from inserters and other entities to avoid blockages."}
