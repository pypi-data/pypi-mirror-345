For example, the stone-furnace requires stone to be gathered first.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into furnaces\n- Make sure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into a furnace. For instance, ensure you have iron-ore before inserting it into the stone furnace.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it.\n\n### Errors when trying to craft with insufficient inventory\n- Keep track of your inventory and ensure you have enough items to craft the desired quantity of products.\n\n### Errors when extracting from furnaces with no ingredients\n- Check the inventory of the furnace before attempting to extract items. Ensure that the furnace has produced items before extraction."}
