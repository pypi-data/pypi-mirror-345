{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production (Position 0,0 and 2,0)\nTwo furnaces dedicated to producing iron plates:\n- Furnace 1 at (0,0) with coal fuel (17), processing iron ore into iron plates (12)\n- Furnace 2 at (2,0) with coal fuel (18), processing iron ore into iron plates (11)\nBoth furnaces are actively working\n\n### Copper Plate Production (Position 4,4 and 6,4)\nTwo furnaces dedicated to producing copper plates:\n- Furnace 3 at (4,4) with coal fuel (24), currently idle due to no ingredients\n- Furnace 4 at (6,4) with coal fuel (24), currently idle due to no ingredients\n\n### Power Generation System (Position -7.5, 18.5)\nComplete power generation setup consisting of:\n- Steam engine at (-7.5, 18.5), working status, containing 200 steam at 165\u00b0\n- Boiler at (-7.5, 22.0), working with 5 coal, containing water (200) and steam (200)\n- Offshore pump at (-7.5, 25.5), working status, containing water (100)\n- Connected pipe groups:\n  - Steam pipes at (-7.5, 15.5)\n  - Empty pipes at (-7.5, 20.5)\n  - Water pipes at (-8.5, 23.5)\n\n### Research Lab Network\nMultiple labs connected to electricity network (ID 4530):\n- One lab with 176 automation science packs\n- One lab with 37 automation science packs\n- Three labs with 5 automation science packs each\n- Several labs awaiting science packs\n- One lab still without power connection\n\n### Power Distribution Network\nNew power pole network expansion:\n- Electric poles at (-2.5, 7.5), (-2.5, 5.5), (-2.5, 6.5)\n- Network extends to multiple other poles covering the area\n- Network operating at 300V\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Lab Power Connection Issues\n- Verify lab positions before attempting to pick up or replace labs\n- Ensure there's clear space for placing new electric poles\n- Create a complete power connection path from powered network to unpowered lab\n\n### Entity Placement Errors\n- Check for existing entities before placing new ones at a location\n- Cannot place electric poles where other entities already exist\n\n### Research Management\n- Technologies like Electronics, Logistics, and Steel Processing are already researched\n- Advanced Material Processing requires logistic science packs as prerequisite\n- Verify technology prerequisites and current research state before attempting new research\n\n### Resource Management\n- Monitor coal levels in inventory before attempting to insert into boiler\n- Keep track of ore supplies for furnaces\n- Ensure furnaces have both fuel and materials to process\n\n### API Usage Errors\n- Correct prototype naming: Use correct attribute names for prototypes (e.g., issue with LogisticsSciencePack vs correct name)\n- Verify entity existence before attempting to extract items\n- Check inventory contents before attempting to insert items"}
