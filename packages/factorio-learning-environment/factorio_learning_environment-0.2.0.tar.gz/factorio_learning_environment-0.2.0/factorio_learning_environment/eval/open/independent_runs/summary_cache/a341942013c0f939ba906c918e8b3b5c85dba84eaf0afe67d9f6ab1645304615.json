{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at position (41.0, -80.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0), which is currently out of fuel.\n- Stone Furnace at position (41.0, -80.0), which is currently out of fuel and lacks ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility at position (-20.0, -71.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -71.0), which is currently out of fuel and lacks ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Facility at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0), which is currently out of fuel.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) for storing mined iron ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to insufficient inventory resources\n- Ensure that there is sufficient coal in your inventory before attempting to insert it into mining drills or furnaces. This will prevent errors like \"Could not insert: No coal to insert from your inventory.\"\n\n### Errors due to entities running out of fuel\n- Regularly check the fuel status of your mining drills and furnaces to ensure they are operational. Keep a steady supply of coal to avoid production halts.\n\n### Errors due to lack of smelting ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Regularly supply them with the required ores to maintain production efficiency.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `insert_item`: Used to insert items into entities. Ensure that the source inventory has the required items before calling this function to avoid errors.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `copper_drill`: Represents the copper mining drill entity. Ensure it is adequately fueled and supplied with resources for continuous operation."}
