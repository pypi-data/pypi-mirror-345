{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll create a report summarizing the structures and error tips:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Complex at (-10, -59)\nConsists of three burner mining drills in a row with shared infrastructure:\n- Burner mining drills at (-10, -59), (-8, -59), and (-6, -59)\n- Collection chests at (-9.5, -57.5), (-7.5, -57.5), and (-5.5, -57.5)\n- Burner inserters at (-9.5, -56.5), (-7.5, -56.5), and (-5.5, -56.5)\n- Transport belt network connecting the mining area\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line at (0, 0)\nLarge smelting array consisting of:\n- Four stone furnaces at (0, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), and (6, 0)\n- Input chests at (0.5, -2.5), (2.5, -2.5), (4.5, -2.5), and (6.5, -2.5)\n- Output chests at (0.5, 2.5), (2.5, 2.5), (4.5, 2.5), and (6.5, 2.5)\n- Burner inserters for input at (0.5, -1.5), (2.5, -1.5), (4.5, -1.5), and (6.5, -1.5)\n- Burner inserters for output at (0.5, 1.5), (2.5, 1.5), (4.5, 1.5), and (6.5, 1.5)\n\n### Copper/Iron Processing Area at (-28, -61)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-28, -61)\n- Stone furnace at (-27, -59)\n- Burner inserters at (-28.5, -58.5) and (-25.5, -58.5)\n- Collection chest at (-24.5, -58.5)\n- Additional furnaces at (-23, -58) and (-21, -58)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Transport Belt Blockage Issues\n- Clear blocked transport belts before attempting to drop items onto them\n- Ensure there is proper item flow and no stalled items on belts\n\n### Furnace Output Blockage\n- Clear space in furnace output areas when \"furnace belt at drop position is blocked\" warnings appear\n- Ensure proper item flow from furnaces to prevent backup\n\n### Mining Output Issues\n- When mining drill shows \"output blocked by item on the ground\", ensure there is a proper collection entity (chest or belt) at the output position\n- Keep mining output paths clear to maintain continuous operation\n\n### Resource Pickup Errors\n- Verify the existence of resources at target positions before attempting pickup operations\n- Double-check coordinates when trying to pick up specific resources"}
