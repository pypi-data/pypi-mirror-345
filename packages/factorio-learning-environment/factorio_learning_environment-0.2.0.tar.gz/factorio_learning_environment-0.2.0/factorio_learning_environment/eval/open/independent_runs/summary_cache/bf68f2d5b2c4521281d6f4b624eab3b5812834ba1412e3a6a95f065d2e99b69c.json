{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nThis facility is responsible for producing iron plates and consists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, -60.0) which extracts iron ore and drops it into a chest at position (4.5, -58.5).\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (4.5, -58.5), (5.5, -60.5), (7.5, -60.5), (6.5, -60.5), (9.5, -60.5), and (8.5, -60.5) for storing extracted resources.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (-15.0, -48.0), (-13.0, -48.0), and (-11.0, -48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Full Output in Furnaces\n- Regularly extract the output from furnaces to prevent them from becoming full and halting production.\n\n### Chest at Drop Position is Full\n- Ensure that the chest at the drop position of the burner mining drill is regularly emptied to allow continuous mining operations.\n\n### No Ingredients to Smelt in Furnaces\n- Ensure that furnaces are consistently supplied with raw materials to maintain continuous production.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked by the agent in the provided logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the current inventory of the agent, including items like 'wooden-chest', 'iron-ore', 'iron-plate', and 'iron-gear-wheel'."}
