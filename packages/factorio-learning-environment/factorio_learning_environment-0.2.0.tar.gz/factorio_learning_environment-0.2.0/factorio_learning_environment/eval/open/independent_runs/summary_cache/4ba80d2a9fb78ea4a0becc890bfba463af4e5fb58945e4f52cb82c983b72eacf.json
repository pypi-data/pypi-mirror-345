{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Setup at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and outputs to a chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Inserter Alignment and Functionality\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly aligned and positioned to transfer materials from the chest to the furnace. Frequent repositioning indicates potential misalignment.\n\n### Errors in Refueling\n- Maintain sufficient coal in the inventory to refuel both the inserter and the mining drill to prevent interruptions in operation.\n\n### Errors in Crafting Non-Craftable Items\n- Avoid attempting to craft raw resources like coal, which must be gathered rather than crafted.\n\n### Errors in Furnace Operation\n- Ensure that the furnace receives iron ore from the inserter. Check the inserter setup if the furnace is not receiving materials.\n\n### Errors with Full Inventory\n- Regularly check and empty the chest to prevent it from becoming full, which can halt the mining operation.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Fuel\n- Keep the inserter fueled to maintain continuous operation. An out-of-fuel inserter will not transfer materials."}
