{"content": "\"\"\"\nThe recent attempt to load Copper Ore into the active furnace resulted in the following status:\n\n### Active Furnace Output Status:\n- The furnace currently retains **2 pieces of Copper Ore**, indicating that it did not process any of the Copper Ore that was loaded.\n- It still holds **18 Iron Plates** and is in a **\"WORKING\"** status, which suggests that it is operational but not engaged in smelting Copper Ore.\n\n### Overall Inventory Overview:\n- **Current Inventory**:\n  - 4 pieces of stone furnaces\n  - 7 pieces of coal remaining\n  - 5 pieces of iron ore\n  - **4 pieces of copper ore** remaining in the inventory (after loading).\n  - **3 pieces of iron plates**.\n\n### Observations:\n- The furnace is operational but is not processing the Copper Ore, which indicates a persistent issue with the smelting process.\n- The **2 pieces of Copper Ore** that are currently in the furnace have not been consumed, suggesting that the furnace is not configured to process them or is encountering an error.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Extract Remaining Copper Ore**: Remove the **2 pieces of Copper Ore** from the furnace to reset its state.\n2. **Check Furnace Configuration**: After extraction, I will verify the furnace's settings and ensure it is correctly configured to smelt Copper Ore.\n3. **Reinsert Copper Ore**: Once the furnace is confirmed to be operational, I will attempt to reinsert Copper Ore for processing.\n\nLet\u2019s proceed to extract the **2 pieces of Copper Ore** from the furnace. \n\"\"\"\n\n# Extract the remaining Copper Ore from the active furnace\nextract_item(Prototype.CopperOre, active_furnace, quantity=2)  # Remove the remaining Copper Ore from the furnace \n\n# Check the inventory status of the furnace after extraction\nactive_furnace_inventory_status_after_extraction = inspect_inventory(active_furnace)  # Inspect the status of the furnace post-extraction\noverall_inventory_after_extraction = inspect_inventory()  # Check total inventory after extraction.\n\nprint(f\"Active Furnace inventory status after extraction: {active_furnace_inventory_status_after_extraction}\")  # Status of the furnace after extracting copper\nprint(f\"Overall current inventory after extraction: {overall_inventory_after_extraction}\")  # Total inventory after extraction\nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")  # Review entities available on the map.", "summary_range": "[1-304]"}
