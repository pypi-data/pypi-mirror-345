Empty the chest at the drop position to continue mining.\n\n### Errors when supplying iron ore to furnaces\n- Verify that there is sufficient iron ore in your inventory before attempting to insert it into furnaces.\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Before placing an entity, ensure that the target tile is unoccupied. If an existing object is in the way, find a suitable position to place the entity.\n\n### Errors when transferring iron ore\n- Confirm that the target entity exists at the specified position before attempting to transfer iron ore."}
