Verify the current pipeline network configuration and select the correct, available fluid_system (now observed as 12148) before attempting connection.\n\n\u2022 Redundant Stabilization Delays:\n  - Consistent use of 10-second wait periods following each failed connection attempt causes avoidable delays. Streamline by confirming connection viability prior to imposing fixed wait intervals.\n\n\u2022 Unresolved Water Supply Integration:\n  - Despite repeated connection attempts, the steam engine remains unable to receive water (warnings include \u201cno input liquid\u201d and \u201cno fluid present in connections\u201d). Reassess the alignment and linkage between the offshore pump, boiler, and pipeline network to ensure proper fluid delivery."}
