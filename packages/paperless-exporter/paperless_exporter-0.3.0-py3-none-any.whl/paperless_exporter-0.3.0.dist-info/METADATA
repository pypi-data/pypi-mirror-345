## Features

- Document export (library document and original document, fallback to thumbnail)
- Collection support
- Tags support
- Category support

## Limitations

- Your library is NOT encrypted. If it is encrypted you need to remove
  the encryption with your password through the app first.
- This exports only a subset of all fields.

## Command Line Usage

After installing the package, you can use the CLI to export your Paperless library:

```sh
paperless-exporter <path-to-paperless-library> <output-folder>
```

- `<path-to-paperless-library>`: Path to your Paperless library directory
  (must end in `.paperless` and contain `DocumentWallet.documentwalletsql`).
- `<output-folder>`: Path to an empty directory where the
  Obsidian-compatible Markdown library will be generated.

Example:

```sh
paperless-exporter ~/Documents/library.paperless ~/Documents/obsidian-library
```

If the output folder does not exist, it will be created.
If it exists, it must be empty.

Run `paperless-exporter --help` for more information.
