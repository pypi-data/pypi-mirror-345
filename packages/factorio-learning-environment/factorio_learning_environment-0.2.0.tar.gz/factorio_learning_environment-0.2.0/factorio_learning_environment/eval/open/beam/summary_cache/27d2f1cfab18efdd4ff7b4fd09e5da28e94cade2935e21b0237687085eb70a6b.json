{"content": "It seems there was an oversight in the import statement for the `uniform` function. Let's correct that by using the `random.uniform` function directly, ensuring the random module is properly utilized.\n\nHere's the corrected code:\n\n```python\n# Import the random module at the start of the script\nimport random\n\ndef ensure_entity_placement(prototype, position=None, direction=Direction.UP):\n    \"\"\"\n    Ensure a given entity is placed. Returns the placed entity.\n    Now includes direction for entities that require it.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check if the entity is already placed in the environment\n    entities = get_entities({prototype})\n    if entities:\n        return entities[0]\n    else:\n        # If position is not specified, generate a pseudo-random position\n        if position is None:\n            position = Position(random.uniform(-10, 10), random.uniform(-10, 10))\n        print(f\"Placing {prototype} at {position}.\")\n        return place_entity(prototype, position, direction)\n\n# Use the function to place necessary entities. The direction is now explicitly passed to the place_entity call.\n\n# Place the offshore pump\noffshore_pump = ensure_entity_placement(Prototype.OffshorePump)\n\n# Calculate a position for the boiler adjacent to the offshore pump\nboiler_position = offshore_pump.position.down() if offshore_pump else Position(0, -1)\nboiler = ensure_entity_placement(Prototype.Boiler, boiler_position)\n\n# Place the steam engine next to the boiler with a default direction\nsteam_engine_position = boiler.position.right() if boiler else Position(2, 0)\nsteam_engine = ensure_entity_placement(Prototype.SteamEngine, steam_engine_position)\n\n# Place the electric pole to connect the entities with a default direction\nelectric_pole_position = steam_engine_position.right() if steam_engine else Position(4, 0)\nelectric_pole = ensure_entity_placement(Prototype.SmallElectricPole, electric_pole_position)\n\n# Place the assembling machine close by with a default direction\nassembling_machine_position = electric_pole_position.right() if electric_pole else Position(6, 0)\nassembling_machine = ensure_entity_placement(Prototype.AssemblingMachine1, assembling_machine_position)\n\n# Attempt to connect them if all are placed correctly\ntry:\n    # Refuel the boiler if necessary\n    fuel_level = inspect_inventory(boiler).get(Prototype.Coal, 0)\n    if fuel_level < 5:\n        insert_item(Prototype.Coal, boiler, 5 - fuel_level)\n        print(f\"Refueled Boiler. Current Fuel Level: {inspect_inventory(boiler).get(Prototype.Coal, 0)}\")\n\n    # Establish necessary connections\n    if offshore_pump and boiler:\n        print(f\"Water Connection (Offshore Pump -> Boiler): {'Success' if connect_entities(offshore_pump, boiler) else 'Failed'}\")\n    if boiler and steam_engine:\n        print(f\"Steam Connection (Boiler -> Steam Engine): {'Success' if connect_entities(boiler, steam_engine) else 'Failed'}\")\n    if steam_engine and electric_pole:\n        print(f\"Power Connection (Steam Engine -> Electric Pole): {'Success' if connect_entities(steam_engine, electric_pole) else 'Failed'}\")\n    if electric_pole and assembling_machine:\n        print(f\"Power Connection (Electric Pole -> Assembling Machine): {'Success' if connect_entities(electric_pole, assembling_machine) else 'Failed'}\")\n\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"Exception occurred while reattempting connections: {e}\")\n```\n\n### Key Corrections:\n- **Import Statement**: Ensure `random` is imported, and use `random.uniform` to generate random positions.\n- **Function Call**: Correctly pass the `position` and `direction` to `place_entity`.\n\nThis should resolve the `NameError` related to the `uniform` function. Make sure the rest of the environment and functions like `get_entities`, `place_entity`, `connect_entities`, etc., are correctly defined and available in your environment.", "summary_range": "[1-374]"}
