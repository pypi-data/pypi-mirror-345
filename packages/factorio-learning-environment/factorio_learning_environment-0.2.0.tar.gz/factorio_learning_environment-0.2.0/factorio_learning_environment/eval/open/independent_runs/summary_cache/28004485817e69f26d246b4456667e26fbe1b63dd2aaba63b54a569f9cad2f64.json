{"content": "# FACTORIO AGENT REPORT\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System at Position(-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position(-9.5, -0.5)\n- Boiler at position(-5.0, 2.5)\n- Steam engine at position(0.5, 6.5)\n- Pipe network connecting water from pump to boiler and steam to engine\n- Small electric poles at positions(0.5, 4.5), (4.5, 4.5), (8.5, 4.5), (12.5, 4.5), (16.5, 4.5), (-3.5, 0.5)\n- Inserter at position(-3.5, 2.5) to feed coal into boiler\n- Wooden chest at position(-2.5, 2.5) for coal storage with 20 coal\n\n### Coal Mining System at Position(18.5, 2.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill at position(18.5, 2.5)\n- Inserter at position(18.5, 4.5)\n- Wooden chest at position(18.5, 5.5) (replaced the transport belt)\n\n### Iron Mining and Smelting System at Position(17.5, 72.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill at position(17.5, 72.5) for iron ore\n- Electric mining drill at position(20.5, 72.5) for iron ore\n- Electric furnace at position(17.5, 77.5)\n- Electric furnace at position(20.5, 77.5)\n- Small electric poles at positions(16.5, 70.5), (17.5, 75.5), (20.5, 75.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities too far away\n- Make sure to move closer to the target position before placing entities\n- The maximum placement distance is 10 units from the player position\n\n### Errors when placing entities where something already exists\n- Check if the target position is already occupied before placing entities\n- Use different spacing or direction parameters when placing next to existing entities\n\n### Errors when connecting entities with transport belts\n- Ensure the path between entities is valid and not too complex\n- Remove any blocking entities (like chests) that might be in the way of connections\n- Make sure the source and target positions are compatible with belt connections\n\n### Errors when placing mining drills\n- Verify the terrain is suitable for placement (not water or other unplaceable terrain)\n- Ensure the entire footprint of the mining drill (3x3) is clear before placement\n\n### Errors with inserter placement\n- When using place_entity_next_to, be aware of the direction parameter and existing entities\n- Increase spacing parameter if the target position is already occupied\n- Check if pipes or other entities are blocking the desired inserter position\n- Watch out for items on the ground that might block placement\n- Be careful of overlapping entity footprints when placing inserters near mining drills\n\n### Errors with pipe connections\n- Ensure there is a valid path between fluid-producing and fluid-consuming entities\n- Check that the fluid types match between connected entities (steam vs water)\n- Make sure connection points are not blocked by other entities\n- When connecting boilers to steam engines, ensure proper alignment of fluid inputs/outputs"}
