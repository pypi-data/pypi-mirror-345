{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) with a wooden chest at position (-15.5, -48.5) and another wooden chest at position (-14.5, -48.5).\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0) fueled with coal, with a burner inserter at position (-13.5, -48.5) transferring items from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-10.0, -48.0) with a burner inserter at position (-11.5, -49.5) and another burner inserter at position (-11.5, -46.5) for transferring items.\n\n### Storage and Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-12.5, -51.5), (-15.5, -48.5), (-14.5, -48.5), (-6.5, -49.5), (-6.5, -48.5), (-4.5, -48.5), (-3.5, -48.5), (-14.5, -46.5), (-6.5, -47.5), (-7.5, -47.5), and (-12.5, -45.5).\n- **Burner Inserters** at various positions for transferring items between chests and furnaces, including positions (-14.5, -47.5), (-11.5, -46.5), (-8.5, -47.5), (-9.5, -46.5), (-11.5, -44.5), (-9.5, -44.5), (-11.5, -43.5), and (-9.5, -43.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Crafting Iron Gear Wheels\n- Ensure that all required materials are available in the inventory before attempting to craft iron gear wheels.\n\n### Errors when Placing Inserters\n- Before placing an inserter, verify that the target position is not already occupied by another entity. Adjust spacing, direction, or reference position if necessary.\n\n### Errors when Placing Storage Chests\n- Ensure the target position for placing a wooden chest is unoccupied. If an entity already exists, remove it before continuing.\n- Move closer to the target position if it is too far away to place the entity.\n\n### Errors in Connecting Inserters to Storage Chests\n- Use an inserter to input items into a wooden chest, as belts cannot be connected directly to a chest."}
