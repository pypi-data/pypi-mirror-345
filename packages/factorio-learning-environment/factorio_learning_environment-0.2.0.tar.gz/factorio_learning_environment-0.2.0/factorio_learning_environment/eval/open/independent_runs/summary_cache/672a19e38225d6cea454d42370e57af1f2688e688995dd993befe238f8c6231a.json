{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) containing 750 units of iron ore\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5), aligned to transfer iron ore from the chest to the furnace\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0), currently not receiving iron ore\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Alignment Errors\n- Ensure that the inserter's pickup position is correctly aligned with the chest. The pickup position should match the chest's position to avoid misalignment errors.\n\n### Inserter Placement Errors\n- When placing an inserter, verify that there is no collision with existing entities. Adjust the spacing, direction, or reference position if placement fails due to collisions or unsuitable terrain.\n\n### Fueling Errors\n- Before attempting to insert fuel into a mining drill or inserter, ensure that there is sufficient coal in the inventory to avoid insertion errors.\n\n### Furnace Input Errors\n- Check the setup of the inserter and ensure it is correctly configured to transfer items into the furnace. The furnace should receive the necessary ingredients to operate efficiently."}
