{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage Facility at Position (4.0, -60.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (4.0, -60.0) with a drop position at (4.5, -58.5), currently working and fueled with coal. It has a warning indicating that the chest at the drop position is full.\n- Wooden Chest at position (4.5, -58.5) containing 388 units of iron ore.\n- Additional Wooden Chests at positions (5.5, -60.5), (6.5, -60.5), (7.5, -60.5), (8.5, -60.5), and (9.5, -60.5), each containing 183 units of iron plate.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chests at positions (-4.5, -52.5), (-5.5, -52.5), (-6.5, -50.5), (-7.5, -50.5), (-8.5, -50.5), (-9.5, -50.5), (-10.5, -50.5), (-11.5, -50.5), (-12.5, -50.5), (-13.5, -50.5), and (-14.5, -50.5) with varying amounts of iron plates and iron ore.\n- Iron Chest at position (-3.5, -52.5) containing 1476 units of iron plate.\n- Iron Chest at position (-5.5, -50.5) containing 326 units of iron ore and 1500 units of iron plate.\n\n### Iron Smelting Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnaces at positions (-15.0, -48.0), (-13.0, -48.0), and (-11.0, -48.0), all fueled with coal but currently not smelting due to a lack of ingredients. Each furnace has a small amount of iron plate as a result.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Warning: Chest at Drop Position is Full\n- Ensure that the chest at the drop position of the burner mining drill is regularly emptied to prevent mining interruptions.\n\n### Warning: No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Ensure that the stone furnaces are supplied with the necessary ingredients to maintain continuous smelting operations.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- **Functions Defined:**\n  - No utility functions have been defined by the agent in the provided logs.\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `burner_mining_drill_position`: Position of the burner mining drill, type `Position`.\n  - `wooden_chest_inventory`: Inventory of wooden chests, type `Inventory`.\n  - `iron_chest_inventory`: Inventory of iron chests, type `Inventory`.\n  - `furnace_position`: Position of stone furnaces, type `Position`.\n  - `furnace_inventory`: Inventory of stone furnaces, type `Inventory`."}
