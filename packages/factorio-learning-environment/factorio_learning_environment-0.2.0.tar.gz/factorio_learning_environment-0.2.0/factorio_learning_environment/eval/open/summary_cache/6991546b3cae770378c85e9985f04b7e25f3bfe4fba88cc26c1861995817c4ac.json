{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron ore mining and smelting structure at position around (17.5, 72.5)\nConsists of the following connected entities:\n- Electric mining drill at position (17.5, 72.5) facing down, powered but output blocked due to furnace belt blockage.\n- Stone furnace at position (18.0, 75.0) fueled with coal, working but with full output inventory.\n- Three wooden chests at positions (19.5, 75.5), (21.5, 75.5), and (21.5, 77.5), serving as staged storage for iron plates.\n- Two burner inserters at positions (20.5, 75.5) and (20.5, 77.5), both fueled with coal, moving iron plates between furnace and chests.\n- Small electric pole at (15.5, 75.5) connected to power network.\n\nThis structure enables extraction, smelting, and staged storage of iron plates with improved power connectivity and output handling, though output belt blockage persists.\n\n### Steam power generation structure at position around (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, -0.5) extracting water.\n- Boiler at position (-5.0, 2.5) fueled with coal, working.\n- Steam engine at position (0.5, 6.5) connected to boiler by pipes, working and generating power.\n- Small electric poles near boiler (-4.5, -0.5), steam engine (0.5, 3.5), and newly placed pole at (15.5, 75.5) connected to power network.\n\nThis structure reliably generates electricity from steam power, supplying the factory\u2019s electric network.\n\n### Iron gear wheel assembly structure at position around (25.5, 80.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine 2 at (25.5, 80.5), powered and set to craft iron gear wheels but currently lacking iron plates input.\n- Small electric pole placed near assembler at (25.5, 77.5), connected to power network.\n- Input burner inserter at (20.5, 77.5) feeding into the assembly area.\n- Output burner inserter at (25.5, 83.5), fueled and working.\n- Output wooden chest at (25.5, 82.5), placed after removing previous chest to free space.\n\nThis structure is intended for iron gear wheel production, now powered and with output inserter configured, but still missing input iron plates for crafting.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity placement conflicts due to occupied tiles\n- Attempts to place small electric poles near steam engine and furnace failed due to existing entities occupying tiles.\n- Attempt to place small electric pole next to steam engine at (0.5, 6.5) failed because a pole already exists at (0.5, 3.5).\n- To avoid these errors, always check tile occupancy before placement.\n- Increase spacing, change direction, or adjust reference position when placing entities near others to find free tiles.\n\n### Inserter inventory full or out of fuel issues\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5), (20.5, 77.5), and (25.5, 83.5) are now fueled and operational.\n- Previously, inserters had issues with full inventory or lack of fuel causing stoppage.\n- Ensure inserters have sufficient fuel and manage inventories to avoid insertion failures.\n- Monitor inserter fuel levels and avoid overfilling inventories.\n\n### Crafting and recipe dependency errors\n- Assembling machine 2 at (25.5, 80.5) is now connected to power network and has output inserter and chest configured.\n- However, it still reports ingredient shortage due to missing iron plates input.\n- To mitigate, ensure sufficient input materials are inserted into assembling machines.\n- Connect assembling machines to power network to enable operation.\n\n### Output blockage and power connectivity warnings\n- Mining drill at (17.5, 72.5) continues to report \"furnace belt at drop position is blocked,\" causing output blockage.\n- Furnace output inventory remains full, preventing further smelting output.\n- Ensure output belts and chests are clear and properly connected to accept items.\n- Verify electric poles connect all machines to the power network to ensure operation.\n\nNAMESPACE\nNo user-defined functions have been defined by the agent"}
