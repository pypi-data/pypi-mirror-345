{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Transfer System at position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and deposits it into the chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates, but currently not receiving ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Alignment\n- Ensure that the inserter's pickup position aligns with the chest's position to avoid misalignment errors. The pickup position should match the chest's position for successful transfer of items.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Fueling\n- Regularly check and refuel inserters with coal to maintain their operation. Lack of fuel will prevent the inserter from functioning.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Operation\n- Verify that the furnace is receiving the necessary ingredients (iron ore) to operate. Ensure the inserter is correctly positioned to drop items into the furnace.\n\n### Errors with Inventory Management\n- Ensure sufficient resources, such as coal, are available in the inventory before attempting to refuel entities. Running out of coal will halt operations of fuel-dependent entities.\n\n### General Placement Errors\n- Before placing or repositioning entities, confirm that the target positions are unoccupied and correctly aligned with the intended connections to avoid assertion errors."}
