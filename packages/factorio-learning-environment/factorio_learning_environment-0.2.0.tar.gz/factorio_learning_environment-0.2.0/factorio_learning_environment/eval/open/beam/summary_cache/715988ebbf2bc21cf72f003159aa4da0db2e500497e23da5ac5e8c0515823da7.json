{"content": "Let me analyze what's happening:\n\n1. We keep getting the error: \"Failed to insert coal into stone-furnace... Inventory is full\"\n2. This suggests the furnace already has items in it\n\nLet's try a different approach:\n\n```python\n# Get our reference entities\ndrill = get_entities({Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill})[0]\nfurnace = get_entities({Prototype.StoneFurnace})[0]\n\nprint(f\"Initial setup:\")\nprint(f\"Drill at {drill.position} with drop at {drill.drop_position}\")\nprint(f\"Furnace at {furnace.position}\")\n\n# Check current state\nprint(f\"Current inventory: {inspect_inventory()}\")\nprint(f\"Furnace status: {furnace.status}\")\nprint(f\"Furnace inventory: {inspect_inventory(furnace)}\")\n\n# First try to extract anything that might be in the furnace\ntry:\n    extract_item(Prototype.Coal, furnace.position)\n    print(\"Extracted coal from furnace\")\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"No coal to extract: {e}\")\n\ntry:\n    extract_item(Prototype.IronOre, furnace.position)\n    print(\"Extracted iron ore from furnace\")\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"No iron ore to extract: {e}\")\n\ntry:\n    extract_item(Prototype.IronPlate, furnace.position)\n    print(\"Extracted iron plates from furnace\")\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"No iron plates to extract: {e}\")\n\n# Now try to insert fresh materials\nprint(\"Attempting to insert new materials...\")\ntry:\n    insert_item(Prototype.Coal, furnace, quantity=1)\n    print(\"Successfully added coal\")\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"Failed to add coal: {e}\")\n\ntry:\n    insert_item(Prototype.IronOre, furnace, quantity=1)\n    print(\"Successfully added iron ore\")\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"Failed to add iron ore: {e}\")\n\n# Show final state\nprint(f\"Final furnace inventory: {inspect_inventory(furnace)}\")\nprint(f\"Final player inventory: {inspect_inventory()}\")\n```\n\nThis should help us understand:\n1. What's currently in the furnace\n2. Whether we can extract items\n3. Whether we can insert new items\n4. The current state of both furnace and player inventory", "summary_range": "[1-3216]"}
