{"content": "# Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-18.5, 19.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position -18.5, 19.5), boiler (position -13.5, 20.0), and offshore pump (position -11.5, 26.5).\n\n### Lab at position(-17.5, 23.5)\nConsists of lab (position -17.5, 23.5).\n\n### Pipe network\nConsists of multiple pipe groups connecting various entities, including:\n- PipeGroup (fluid_system=35502, position -18.5, 16.5)\n- PipeGroup (fluid_system=35505, position -12.5, 21.5)\n- PipeGroup (fluid_system=35506, position -8.5, 21.5)\n- PipeGroup (fluid_system=35508, position -10.5, 22.5)\n- PipeGroup (fluid_system=35509, position -7.5, 23.5)\n\n### Small Electric Poles\nConsists of small electric poles at positions:\n- Position (-16.5, 19.5)\n- Position (-19.5, 22.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to crafting items\n- Ensure that all required ingredients are available in your inventory before attempting to craft items. In this case, iron plates are required to craft iron gear wheels.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it.\n\n### Errors related to missing entities\n- Check for the presence of required entities, such as stone furnaces, before attempting to perform actions that depend on them."}
