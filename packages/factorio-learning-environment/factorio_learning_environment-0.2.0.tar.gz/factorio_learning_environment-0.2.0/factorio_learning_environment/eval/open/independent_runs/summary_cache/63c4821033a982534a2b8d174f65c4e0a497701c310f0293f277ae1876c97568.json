Repeated failures at coordinates such as (-4.0, 26.5), (-7.0, 25.5), (-6.0, 26.0), (-5.0, 26.5), and (-7.5, 27.0) indicate conflicts with water footprints or existing objects.\n\u2003\u2013 Verify the alignment and compatibility of connection endpoints between the boiler\u2019s output and the generator\u2019s connection points before placing pipes.\n\n\u2022 Alternative Connection & Intermediate Routing Challenges:\n\u2003\u2013 When direct connections fail, pre-assess alternative connection points and intermediate routes to avoid water-covered areas. Multiple attempts with offset points (e.g. at (-4.5, 26.5)) and planned Manhattan paths have shown that water interference remains a critical obstacle.\n\u2003\u2013 Fully remove any redundant pipeline fragments that could block new pipe placements before reattempting connection.\n\n\u2022 Entity Repositioning & Fluid Network Integration:\n\u2003\u2013 Retrieve and use positional attributes correctly (for example, accessing the \u2018center\u2019 attribute rather than invoking it as a function) to ensure entities are moved within buildable areas.\n\u2003\u2013 Confirm that the fluid network components are correctly aligned and merged so that the intended steam transmission path is clear and fluid types match at connection points."}
