{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-46.5, -122.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (-41.5, -117.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting these entities\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-19.0, -73.0) with a current inventory of copper plates\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0) with a current inventory of iron plates\n\n### Additional Structures\n- Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5)\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5)\n- Lab with input of automation science packs\n- Wooden Chest at Position (6.5, -59.5) containing iron plates\n- Multiple PipeGroups and ElectricityGroup for fluid and power distribution\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Pipes\n- Ensure there is no obstruction at the target location before attempting to place pipes. Clear any existing objects in the way.\n\n### Errors when Connecting Electric Poles\n- Verify that the electric poles are within range and correctly aligned to establish a connection. Avoid overlapping connections that result in nil values.\n\n### Steam Engine Power Generation Error\n- Ensure that the steam engine has a sufficient supply of steam and is properly connected to the power network to generate power. Check for any disconnected pipes or poles.\n\n### Inserter Not Receiving Power\n- Check that the inserter is connected to a power source and that the power network is operational. Ensure all connections are secure and poles are correctly placed.\n\nThese tips should help in avoiding common mistakes and improving the efficiency of the setup."}
