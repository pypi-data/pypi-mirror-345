Move any obstructing entities before reconnecting.\n\n### Errors when adding fuel to boiler\n- The second argument for the `insert_item` function must be an Entity or EntityGroup. Ensure you are passing the correct entity reference instead of a position.\n\n### Errors when removing entities\n- The second argument for the removal function must be a Position object. Verify that you are using the correct type when attempting to remove entities.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items."}
