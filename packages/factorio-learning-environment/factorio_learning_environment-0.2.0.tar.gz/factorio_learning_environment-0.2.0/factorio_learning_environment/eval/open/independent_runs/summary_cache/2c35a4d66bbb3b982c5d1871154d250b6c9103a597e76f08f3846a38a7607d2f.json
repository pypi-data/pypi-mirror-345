Frequent repositioning indicates possible misalignment.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Ingredients\n- Verify that the inserter is correctly configured and operational to deliver iron ore to the furnace. Check the inserter's status and ensure it is not waiting for source items.\n\n### Chest Overcapacity\n- Regularly monitor the chest's inventory to prevent overcapacity, which can halt the mining drill's operation. Empty the chest periodically to maintain continuous mining.\n\n### Fuel Management for Inserters and Drills\n- Ensure that inserters and mining drills are consistently refueled to maintain operation. Monitor coal levels and refuel as necessary to prevent downtime."}
