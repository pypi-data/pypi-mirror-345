{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production at (-73.5, 2.5)\nConsists of two furnaces working in parallel:\n- Stone furnace at position (3.0, -73.0)\n- Stone furnace at position (5.0, -73.0)\nBoth furnaces have coal as fuel but currently have no iron ore to process. They each contain 21 iron plates in their output.\n\n### Copper Plate Production at (-69.0, 4.0)\nConsists of two furnaces working in parallel:\n- Stone furnace at position (3.0, -69.0)\n- Stone furnace at position (5.0, -69.0)\nBoth furnaces have coal as fuel but currently have no copper ore to process. They each contain 13 copper plates in their output.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when trying to place entities without required items in inventory\n- Before attempting to place structures like furnaces or labs, ensure you have the required items in your inventory\n- In this case, the agent tried to place a lab at (0.0, -80.0) without having a lab in inventory\n\n### Errors when trying to insert items that are not in inventory\n- Before attempting to insert items (like coal) into entities, verify that you have the required items in your inventory\n- If you need to insert fuel, make sure to harvest or craft the necessary fuel items first\n\n### Errors related to furnace operation\n- Monitor furnace input inventories to ensure continuous operation\n- Currently all furnaces are idle due to lack of ore input, consider restocking ore supplies when furnaces run empty"}
