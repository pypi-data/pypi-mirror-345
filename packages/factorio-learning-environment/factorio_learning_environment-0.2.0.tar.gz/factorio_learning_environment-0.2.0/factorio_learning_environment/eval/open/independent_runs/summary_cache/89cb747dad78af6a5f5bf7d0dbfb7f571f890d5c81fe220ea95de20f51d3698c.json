{"content": "# FACTORIO REPORT\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System (x=-9.5, y=1.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump (x=-9.5, y=1.5) - currently working\n- Boiler (x=-5.5, y=4.0) - out of fuel, not working\n- Steam engine (x=-0.5, y=7.5) - not connected to power network, no input liquid\n- Pipe network connecting these components\n- Small electric pole (x=1.5, y=7.5)\n\nThe system is currently not operational due to the boiler being out of fuel. Coal was added in steps 112, 115, and 117, but by step 119 the boiler was out of fuel again. The power outage is affecting all electrical components in the factory.\n\n### Iron Mining and Smelting Setup (x=18.5, y=73.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill (x=18.5, y=73.5) mining iron ore - currently not working due to full chest and no power\n- Wooden chest (x=18.5, y=75.5) collecting iron ore from the drill (currently contains 800 iron ore)\n- Stone furnace (x=19.0, y=77.0) with 11 coal, currently working with 6 iron ore\n- Inserter (x=19.5, y=78.5) to move iron plates from furnace to chest - not working due to no power\n- Wooden chest (x=19.5, y=79.5) for iron plate storage (currently contains 11 iron plates)\n- Chest output inserter (x=19.5, y=80.5) to extract plates from chest - not working due to no power\n- Transport belt system starting at (x=19.5, y=81.5) with belts extending to (x=14.5, y=78.5) - currently contains 32 iron plates\n- Additional belt system from (x=8.5, y=75.5) to (x=9.5, y=77.5) connecting to the circuit assembly\n- Small electric poles (x=21.5, y=73.5), (x=20.5, y=75.5), (x=21.5, y=78.5), (x=21.5, y=80.5)\n\nThe system is partially working with the furnace smelting iron ore into plates, but the mining drill is not working due to the full chest and power outage. The agent has been manually extracting iron plates from the belt to clear it.\n\n### Copper Mining and Smelting Setup (x=-48.5, y=78.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill (x=-48.5, y=78.5) mining copper ore - currently not working due to full chest and no power\n- Wooden chest (x=-48.5, y=80.5) collecting copper ore from the drill (currently contains 800 copper ore)\n- Stone furnace (x=-48.0, y=82.0) with 9 coal, currently working with 7 copper ore\n- Inserter (x=-47.5, y=83.5) to move copper plates from furnace to chest - not working due to no power\n- Wooden chest (x=-47.5, y=84.5) for copper plate storage (currently contains 36 copper plates)\n- Chest output inserter (x=-47.5, y=85.5) to extract plates from chest - not working due to no power\n- Transport belt system starting at (x=-47.5, y=86.5) extending to (x=-22.5, y=86.5) - currently contains 103 copper plates\n- Small electric poles (x=-45.5, y=78.5), (x=-46.5, y=80.5), (x=-45.5, y=83.5), (x=-45.5, y=85.5)\n\nThe system is partially working with the furnace smelting copper ore into plates, but the mining drill is not working due to the full chest and power outage. The agent has been trying to extract copper plates from the belt but has been unsuccessful in recent attempts.\n\n### Circuit Production System\nConsists of:\n\n#### Copper Cable Assembly (x=-6.5, y=74.5)\n- Assembling machine 2 "}
