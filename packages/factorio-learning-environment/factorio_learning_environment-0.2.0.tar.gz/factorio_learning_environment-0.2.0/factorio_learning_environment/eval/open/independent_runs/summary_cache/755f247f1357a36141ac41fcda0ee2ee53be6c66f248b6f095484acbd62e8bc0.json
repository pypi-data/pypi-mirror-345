{"content": "# Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0) with coal fuel, smelting iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (1.5, 0.5) transferring iron plates from the furnace to a wooden chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (2.5, 0.5) storing iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (3.5, 0.5) extracting iron plates from the wooden chest and placing them onto a transport belt.\n- **BeltGroup** connecting the chest inserter to the second burner inserter:\n  - Input Belt from (3.5, 0.5) to (5.5, 0.5).\n  - Output Belt from (4.5, 0.5) to (6.5, 0.5).\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (6.5, 0.5) picking up iron plates from the belt and placing them into a wooden chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (7.5, 0.5) collecting iron plates from the belt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities with spacing issues\n- Ensure there is enough space for placing entities and adjust the spacing or direction if necessary to avoid overlapping with existing entities.\n\n### Errors when connecting belts directly from a chest\n- Use an inserter to extract items from a chest before attempting to connect them to a belt system.\n\n### Errors due to lack of inventory items\n- Ensure you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to place or craft entities. Gather required resources like wood for crafting wooden chests.\n\n### Errors when inserting items without inventory stock\n- Verify that you have the items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities like furnaces or inserters."}
