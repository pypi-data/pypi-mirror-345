{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron ore mining and smelting structure at position around (17.5, 72.5)\nConsists of the following connected entities:\n- Electric mining drill at position (17.5, 72.5) facing down, powered but output blocked due to furnace belt blockage.\n- Stone furnace at position (18.0, 75.0) fueled with coal, actively smelting iron ore but frequently full output inventory.\n- Three wooden chests at positions (19.5, 75.5), (21.5, 75.5), and (21.5, 77.5) serving as storage for iron plates.\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5) and (20.5, 77.5) fueled and operational, feeding the chests.\n- Small electric pole at (15.5, 75.5) connected to power network.\n- Output belt blockage at furnace output persists, limiting mining drill throughput.\n\nThis structure enables iron ore extraction, smelting, and staged storage of iron plates with improved power connectivity and inserter fueling, though output belt blockage remains unresolved.\n\n### Steam power generation structure at position around (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, -0.5) extracting water.\n- Boiler at position (-5.0, 2.5), currently out of fuel and not working.\n- Steam engine at position (0.5, 6.5), connected to boiler by pipes, working and generating power.\n- Small electric poles near boiler (-4.5, -0.5), steam engine (0.5, 3.5), and newly placed poles at (0.5, 6.5), (17.5, 72.5), and (25.5, 80.5) connected to power network.\n\nThis structure generates electricity from steam power, though boiler fuel shortage currently halts steam production.\n\n### Iron gear wheel assembly structure at position around (25.5, 80.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine 2 at (25.5, 80.5), powered and connected to small electric pole at (25.5, 80.5).\n- Input wooden chest at (21.5, 75.5) feeding iron plates into assembly area.\n- Output wooden chest at (25.5, 82.5) with burner inserter at (25.5, 83.5) fueled and operational, moving assembled items into output chest.\n- Assembling machine intermittently contains iron plates and iron gear wheels but often empty, indicating inconsistent input supply or extraction.\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5), (20.5, 77.5), and (25.5, 83.5) fueled and operational.\n\nThis structure is intended for iron gear wheel production and now has power and output inserter setup, with recent successful insertion of iron plates into assembler input, though output extraction remains unfulfilled.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Persistent output belt blockage at furnace output\n- The electric mining drill at (17.5, 72.5) remains blocked due to full furnace output belt.\n- The furnace output inventory frequently fills, preventing further smelting and blocking mining drill output.\n- To resolve, extend or clear output belts and chests to accept more iron plates, ensuring continuous throughput.\n\n### Boiler fuel shortage causing steam power interruption\n- Boiler at (-5.0, 2.5) is currently out of fuel, causing steam production to stop despite working steam engine.\n- Regularly insert coal into the boiler to maintain continuous steam generation and power supply.\n\n### Small electric pole placement conflicts\n- Attempts to place small electric poles near (18.0, 75.0) failed due to tile occupancy by mining drill and water tiles.\n- Verify tile availability before placement; adjust spacing, direction, or reference position to find valid placement spots.\n\n### Inconsistent assembling machine input and output handling\n- Assembling machine at (25.5, 80.5) intermittently has iron plates and iron gear wheels but often empty inventories.\n- Output chest at (25.5, 82.5) remains empty despite production, indicating output extraction issues.\n- Ensure continuous insertion of iron plates into assembler input chest and proper extraction of finished gear wheels from output chest.\n- Monitor inserter states to prevent waiting for source items or blocked outputs.\n\n### Inserter fuel and inventory management\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5), (20.5, 77.5), and (25.5, 83.5) are consistently fueled and operational.\n- Continue monitoring inserter fuel levels and inventories to prevent stoppages.\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nNo user-defined functions have been defined by the agent in the provided steps."}
