Verify that both source and target connection points are clear of obstructions, correctly aligned, and within the allowed range. Ensure that sufficient quantities of combined pipes and pipe-to-ground items are available.\n\u2003- For custom routes employing intermediate nodes, confirm that node placements are in buildable areas and that connection endpoints properly align with the entities\u2019 connection points. Also, validate that fluid outputs from the source match the expected inputs at the target.\n\n\u2022 Crafting and Inventory Dependency Issues\n\u2003- Errors like \u201cFailed to craft \u2026 pipe because couldn\u2019t craft a required sub-ingredient for pipe \u2013 iron-plate\u201d indicate that the production of essential sub-ingredients (such as iron plates) is not meeting recipe needs. Ensure that smelting operations are properly fueled (e.g., by inserting sufficient coal into the Stone Furnace) and that the global inventory reflects a surplus of necessary materials.\n\u2003- Monitor inventory levels closely, particularly when reattempting crafting recipes that depend on prior smelting outputs.\n\n\u2022 Offshore Pump and Placement Challenges\n\u2003- Repeated connection failures originating from offshore pump placements suggest that the pump must be positioned correctly within the fluid network. Use a pump in working condition (as demonstrated by the working offshore pump at (-7.5, 25.5)) and verify its connection points are unobstructed.\n\u2003\n\u2022 Resource API and Position Handling\n\u2003- Consistently avoid treating Position objects as callable. Access resource attributes correctly (such as water patch details) to prevent misinterpretation of object types during placement or connection routines."}
