Check the supply lines and ensure that resources are being delivered to the inserters.\n\n### Failed to Clear Drop Position Chests\n- Ensure that the chests at drop positions are not full. Regularly check and clear the contents of these chests to prevent blockages in the production line.\n\n### Furnace Belt Blocked\n- Ensure that the output of the furnaces is not blocked. Regularly clear the furnace outputs to maintain a smooth production flow.\n\n### Furnace Result is Full\n- Regularly check the furnace outputs and clear them to prevent the furnace from stopping due to full output inventory."}
