{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing Setup at Position (x=41.0, y=-82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0) extracting coal, connected to:\n  - **Burner Inserter** at position (x=41.5, y=-83.5) transferring coal to:\n    - **Wooden Chest** at position (x=42.5, y=-83.5) storing coal.\n  - **Burner Inserter** at position (x=41.5, y=-80.5) transferring coal to:\n    - **Wooden Chest** at position (x=41.5, y=-79.5) storing coal.\n\n### Iron Plate Production at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0) and (x=2.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with no ingredients to smelt, currently holding 50 iron plates.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=2.0, y=0.0) with no ingredients to smelt, currently holding 63 iron plates.\n\n### Coal Transport Belt System\nConsists of:\n- **Belt Group** connecting from position (x=42.5, y=-83.5) to (x=45.5, y=-83.5), transporting coal with an inventory of 8 coal units.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entity has items available for the inserter to pick up. Check the inventory of the source entity and ensure it is not empty.\n\n### Furnace No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Ensure that the furnaces have the necessary raw materials to process. Check the furnace source inventory and supply the required ingredients for smelting.\n\n### Stale Entity Data\n- Ensure that the entity data is updated and not stale. Refresh or reload the entity data to reflect the current state of the map."}
