{"content": "The error indicates that there is no steam engine or other power source available nearby to connect the assembling machine. This is why the assembling machine remains unpowered despite placing electric poles. Here are some steps to resolve this issue:\n\n### Steps to Resolve:\n\n1. **Check for Existing Power Sources:**\n   - Verify if there are any power sources like steam engines or solar panels in the vicinity. If not, you will need to set one up.\n\n2. **Set Up a Power Source:**\n   - If there is no existing power source, you will need to create one. The simplest setup involves a boiler and a steam engine.\n   - Ensure you have water access for the boiler and fuel (like coal) to power it.\n\n3. **Connect the Power Source:**\n   - Once the power source is established, connect it to the electric poles leading to the assembling machine.\n\n4. **Verify Power Network:**\n   - Use the power network view to ensure that the assembling machine is within the coverage area of the electric poles connected to the power source.\n\n### Example Code to Set Up a Basic Power Source:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Place a boiler and a steam engine\nboiler_position = Position(x=5, y=0)  # Adjust position as needed\nsteam_engine_position = Position(x=6, y=0)  # Adjust position as needed\n\ntry:\n    boiler = place_entity(Prototype.Boiler, boiler_position)\n    steam_engine = place_entity(Prototype.SteamEngine, steam_engine_position)\n    print(\"Boiler and steam engine placed.\")\n\n    # Step 2: Connect the boiler to a water source and add fuel\n    connect_to_water(boiler)\n    insert_item(Prototype.Coal, boiler, quantity=10)  # Ensure sufficient fuel\n\n    # Step 3: Connect the steam engine to the power network\n    connect_entities(steam_engine, new_pole)\n    print(\"Steam engine connected to power network.\")\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"Error setting up power source: {e}\")\n\n# Step 4: Verify the power network status\nfinal_entities_status = get_entities()\nprint(f\"Final Entity Status with Power Source: {final_entities_status}\")\n```\n\n### Tips:\n- Ensure that the boiler is connected to a water source and has enough fuel to operate.\n- The steam engine must be directly connected to the boiler to generate electricity.\n- Use electric poles to extend the power network from the steam engine to the assembling machine.\n\nBy setting up a proper power source and ensuring connections, the assembling machine should receive power and start producing copper cables.", "summary_range": "[1-126]"}
