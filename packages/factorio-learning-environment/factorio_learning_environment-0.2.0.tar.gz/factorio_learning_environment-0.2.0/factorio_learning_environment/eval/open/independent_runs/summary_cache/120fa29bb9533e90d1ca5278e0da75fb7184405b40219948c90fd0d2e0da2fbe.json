Multiple recovery updates attempted to locate, craft, and place the Lab; however, placement failed due to missing inventory and insufficient sub-components.\n\n### Iron Smelting Furnace at Position(5.0, 5.0)\nUsed to smelt iron ore with coal into iron plates. This furnace was retrieved as an alternative processing unit during recovery operations, enabling the conversion of iron ore into a significantly increased iron plate count.\n\n### Copper Smelting Furnace at Position(-27.0, -60.0)\nEmployed for copper plate production by smelting harvested copper ore with coal. The furnace facilitated the processing required to boost copper plate availability for subsequent crafting steps.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 API Usage for Entity Retrieval\n  - Use the correct function signature for get_entities: avoid unsupported keyword arguments (e.g., \"radius\") and ensure the number of positional arguments matches the API\u2019s expectations.\n  - Implement appropriate fallback handling (such as defaulting to an empty list) to prevent iterating over None.\n\n\u2022 Lab Placement and Crafting Failures\n  - Confirm that the required Lab entity exists in inventory before attempting placement.\n  - Verify that all sub-ingredients (e.g., iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, copper-cables) are available or craftable, ensuring that the production chain for complex items is fully supported.\n  \n\u2022 Handling None Values in Iterations\n  - Check for None returns from API calls before iterating over results to avoid TypeError exceptions."}
