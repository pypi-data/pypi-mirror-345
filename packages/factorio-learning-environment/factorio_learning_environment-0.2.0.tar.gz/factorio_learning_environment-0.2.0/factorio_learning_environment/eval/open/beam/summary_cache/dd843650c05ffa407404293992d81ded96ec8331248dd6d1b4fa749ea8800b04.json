{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (3.0, -73.0)\n  - Fueled by coal and processing iron ore into iron plates.\n  - Current status: No ingredients to smelt; producing 69 iron plates.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (5.0, -73.0)\n  - Fueled by coal and processing iron ore into iron plates.\n  - Current status: No ingredients to smelt; producing 67 iron plates.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Operation\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (0.0, -74.0)\n  - Fueled by coal, extracting iron ore.\n  - Current status: Waiting for space in destination; output is full. Suggested to place a sink object at (-0.5, -75.5) to unblock.\n  - Drops resources into a **Wooden Chest** at position (-0.5, -75.5).\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-1.0, -73.0)\n  - Fueled by coal, actively extracting iron ore.\n  - Current status: Working and dropping resources into a **Wooden Chest** at position (-1.5, -74.5).\n\n### Resource Collection\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-1.5, -74.5)\n  - Collecting iron ore from the burner mining drill at (-1.0, -73.0).\n  - Current inventory: 9 iron ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Crafting Due to Missing Ingredients\n- Ensure all required sub-ingredients are available before attempting to craft items. For example, iron plates need to be smelted in a furnace as they cannot be crafted directly.\n\n### Errors When Placing Entities in Occupied Positions\n- Verify that the target position is clear of other entities before placing a new entity. For instance, attempting to place a stone furnace or burner mining drill where another entity already exists will result in an error.\n\n### Errors Due to Missing Inventory Items\n- Check inventory for required items before attempting to place entities, such as wooden chests. If an item is not available, gather the necessary raw resources first.\n\n### Errors in Gathering Raw Resources\n- Raw resources like wood must be gathered manually as they do not have a crafting recipe. Ensure to gather these resources before attempting to craft items that require them.\n\n### Errors in Placement Due to Full Output\n- Ensure there is a sink object, such as a chest, at the output position of a mining drill to prevent it from being blocked when the output is full.\n\n### Errors Due to No Ingredients in Furnaces\n- Monitor the status of furnaces to ensure they have the necessary ingredients to continue smelting. Regularly supply iron ore to prevent production halts.\n\n### Errors When Inserting Items Without Inventory\n- Ensure that you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. For example, attempting to insert iron ore into a furnace without having iron ore in your inventory will result in an error.\n\n### Errors When Extracting from Empty Containers\n- Verify that the container has the required items before attempting extraction. For instance, trying to extract iron ore from an empty chest will result in an error.\n\n### Errors Due to Insufficient Fuel for Mining Drills\n- Ensure that mining drills are adequately fueled to maintain continuous operation. Refuel them regularly to avoid interruptions in resource extraction."}
