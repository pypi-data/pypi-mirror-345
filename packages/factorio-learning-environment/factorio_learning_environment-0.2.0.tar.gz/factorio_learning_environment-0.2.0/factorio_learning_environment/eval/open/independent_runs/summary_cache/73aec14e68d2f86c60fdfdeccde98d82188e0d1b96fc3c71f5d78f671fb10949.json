{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) with a status of NO_FUEL, connected to a Stone Furnace at position (41.0, -80.0).\n- Stone Furnace at position (41.0, -80.0) with a status of NO_FUEL.\n\n### Iron Ore Mine at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) with a status of WORKING, connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) with a status of NORMAL.\n\n### Copper Furnace at Position (-20.0, -71.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -71.0) with a status of NO_FUEL and no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (43.5, -79.5) with a status of NORMAL.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Inventory Items\n- Ensure that you have sufficient coal in your inventory before attempting to insert it into mining drills or furnaces. This will prevent errors related to \"No coal to insert from your inventory.\"\n\n### Timeout Errors\n- Consider optimizing the processes or checking the conditions that might lead to a timeout. This could involve ensuring that all necessary resources are available and that there are no bottlenecks in the production chain.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - `insert_item`: Used to insert items into entities. Ensure that the item and quantity are available in the inventory before calling this function to avoid insertion errors.\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `iron_furnace`: Represents the iron furnace entity, used in insertion operations.\n  - `iron_drill`: Represents the iron mining drill entity, used in insertion operations."}
