{"content": "It seems that the script is consistently printing \"Starting diagnostic procedure...\" but not progressing beyond that point. This suggests that there might be an issue early in the script execution, possibly related to the retrieval of entities or the initial setup. Here are some steps to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:\n\n1. **Verify Entity Retrieval Functions**: Ensure that the `get_entities` function is correctly implemented and that the game environment is properly set up with the entities you are trying to retrieve. If the entities are not present or the function is not working as expected, the script will not proceed.\n\n2. **Add Debugging Prints**: Place print statements immediately after each `get_entities` call to verify whether entities are being retrieved. This will help identify if the script is getting stuck at a specific retrieval step.\n\n3. **Check for Errors or Exceptions**: Ensure that any exceptions are being caught and printed. If an exception is occurring before the assertions, it might not be visible. Double-check the exception handling block to ensure it captures and prints any errors.\n\n4. **Environment Setup**: Double-check your Factorio environment to ensure all entities are correctly placed and accessible. If the environment is not set up correctly, the entities might not be found.\n\n5. **Simplify Initial Steps**: Temporarily simplify the script to only print messages after each major step, such as after each entity retrieval, to isolate where the issue might be occurring.\n\nHere's a simplified version of the script with additional debugging prints:\n\n```python\nprint(\"Starting diagnostic procedure...\")\n\ntry:\n    # Attempt to retrieve entities with immediate feedback\n    print(\"Retrieving Offshore Pumps...\")\n    offshore_pumps = get_entities({Prototype.OffshorePump})\n    print(f\"Offshore Pumps: {len(offshore_pumps)} retrieved.\") if offshore_pumps else print(\"No Offshore Pumps found.\")\n\n    print(\"Retrieving Boilers...\")\n    boilers = get_entities({Prototype.Boiler})\n    print(f\"Boilers: {len(boilers)} retrieved.\") if boilers else print(\"No Boilers found.\")\n\n    print(\"Retrieving Steam Engines...\")\n    steam_engines = get_entities({Prototype.SteamEngine})\n    print(f\"Steam Engines: {len(steam_engines)} retrieved.\") if steam_engines else print(\"No Steam Engines found.\")\n\n    print(\"Retrieving Electric Poles...\")\n    electric_poles = get_entities({Prototype.SmallElectricPole})\n    print(f\"Electric Poles: {len(electric_poles)} retrieved.\") if electric_poles else print(\"No Electric Poles found.\")\n\n    print(\"Retrieving Assembling Machines...\")\n    assembling_machines = get_entities({Prototype.AssemblingMachine1})\n    print(f\"Assembling Machines: {len(assembling_machines)} retrieved.\") if assembling_machines else print(\"No Assembling Machines found.\")\n\n    # Check if all necessary entities have been retrieved\n    missing_entities = []\n    if not offshore_pumps:\n        missing_entities.append(\"Offshore Pump\")\n    if not boilers:\n        missing_entities.append(\"Boiler\")\n    if not steam_engines:\n        missing_entities.append(\"Steam Engine\")\n    if not electric_poles:\n        missing_entities.append(\"Electric Pole\")\n    if not assembling_machines:\n        missing_entities.append(\"Assembling Machine\")\n\n    if missing_entities:\n        raise AssertionError(f\"Missing Entities: {', '.join(missing_entities)}\")\n    \n    print(\"All necessary entities confirmed present.
