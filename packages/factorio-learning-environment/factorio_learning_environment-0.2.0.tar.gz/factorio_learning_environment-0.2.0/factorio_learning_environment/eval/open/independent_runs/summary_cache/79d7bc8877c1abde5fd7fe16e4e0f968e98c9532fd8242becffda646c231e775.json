{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0): Used for smelting iron ore into iron plates. Currently working with coal as fuel and smelting iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (1.5, 0.5): Transfers iron plates from the stone furnace to the wooden chest. It is fueled by coal and is currently working.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (2.5, 0.5): Collects iron plates transferred by the burner inserter. Currently contains 16 iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (4.5, 0.5): Intended to transfer items from a belt to a chest. Currently waiting for source items.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities into occupied tiles\n- Ensure that the target tile for placing an entity is unoccupied. If there is an existing entity or item, consider clearing the area or choosing a different position.\n\n### Errors when connecting belts directly to non-belt entities\n- Use an inserter to connect belts to non-belt entities such as chests. Belts cannot be directly connected to entities like wooden chests.\n\n### Errors due to lack of inventory items\n- Before attempting to place or craft entities, ensure the required items are available in the inventory. For example, ensure you have burner inserters or transport belts before trying to place them.\n\n### Errors when crafting without required sub-ingredients\n- Verify that all necessary sub-ingredients are available before attempting to craft complex items. For instance, crafting transport belts requires iron plates, which must be smelted in a furnace.\n\n### Errors due to incorrect placement direction\n- Check the direction and spacing when placing entities next to others. Adjust the direction or increase spacing if placement fails due to collisions or incorrect positioning."}
