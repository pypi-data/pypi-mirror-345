{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nNo structures have been successfully created on the map. All attempts to place entities have failed, resulting in no entities being present on the map after the automation setup.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure that the target tile is unoccupied and suitable for the entity you are trying to place. The agent attempted to place various entities (Wooden Chest, Stone Furnace, ore inserter, plate inserter, output chest) at multiple coordinates, but all attempts failed, indicating potential issues with occupied or unsuitable tiles.\n\n### Errors with movement\n- Check that the pathfinding logic is correctly implemented and that the goal position is valid. Errors such as \"Could not get path from x=199.5 y=199.5 to x=400.5 y=400.0\" suggest issues with path requests and goal positions.\n- Ensure that indices used in movement functions are integers. Errors like \"Cannot move. string indices must be integers, not 'str'\" indicate incorrect data types being used in movement operations.\n\n### General Tips\n- Double-check the coordinates and conditions before attempting to place entities or move to new positions to avoid repeated errors and ensure successful execution of tasks."}
