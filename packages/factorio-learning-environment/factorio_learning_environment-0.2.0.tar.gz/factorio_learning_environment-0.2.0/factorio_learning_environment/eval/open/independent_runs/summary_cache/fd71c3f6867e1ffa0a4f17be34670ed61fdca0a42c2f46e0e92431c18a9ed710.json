Verify the entity's inventory before attempting extraction to avoid errors.\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities on Occupied Tiles\n- Before placing an entity, confirm that the target tile is unoccupied. If an entity already exists at the desired position, consider increasing spacing, changing direction, or selecting a different reference position.\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities with Incorrect Spacing\n- When placing entities next to each other, ensure that the spacing and direction are appropriate. Adjust the spacing or direction if there are collisions with existing entities or if the area is unsuitable for placement."}
