{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n--------------------\nNo structures have been successfully placed on the map so far. Although the agent made several attempts to supply a Lab at position (0.5, 2.5) for Automation Science Pack research, repeated errors (lack of Lab inventory and missing sub\u2010ingredients) prevented its creation. Other facilities (such as furnaces for smelting iron and copper) were referenced during processing, but no new production structures were actually constructed on the map.\n\nERROR TIPS\n----------\n\u2022 API Usage \u2013 get_entities Misuse:\n  - Use the correct signature when calling get_entities. Remove unexpected keyword arguments (like \u201cradius\u201d) or adjust parameter order so that the call matches the function\u2019s requirements.\n\n\u2022 Lab Placement and Inventory Checks:\n  - Verify that the required Lab unit is present in the inventory before attempting to place it. Ensure that the inventory has all necessary items to satisfy the Lab\u2019s recipe.\n\n\u2022 Handling Null Returns:\n  - When iterating over results from functions such as get_entities, confirm the return value is an iterable (or default to an empty list) to avoid TypeErrors from None values.\n\n\u2022 Crafting and Resource Shortages:\n  - Before crafting complex items like a Lab, validate that all sub-ingredients (for example, iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, and copper-cables) are available in sufficient quantities. Strengthen production chains (smelting and assembly) to meet these cascading recipe requirements.\n\n\u2022 Consistent Resource Management:\n  - Monitor and adjust resource production (e.g. smelting iron and copper plates) to ensure that intermediate components are not in shortage when needed for high-level crafts such as Lab production."}
