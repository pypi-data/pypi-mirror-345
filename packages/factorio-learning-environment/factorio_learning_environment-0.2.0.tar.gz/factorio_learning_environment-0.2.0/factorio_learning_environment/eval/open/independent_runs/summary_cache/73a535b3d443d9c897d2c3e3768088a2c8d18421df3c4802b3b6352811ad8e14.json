Check the machine's output inventory to confirm the presence of the desired item.\n\n### Errors when Placing Items into a Tile Occupied by Another Entity\n- Verify that the target tile is unoccupied before placing an entity to avoid placement errors.\n\n### Errors when Using Extracting but Being Too Far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items."}
