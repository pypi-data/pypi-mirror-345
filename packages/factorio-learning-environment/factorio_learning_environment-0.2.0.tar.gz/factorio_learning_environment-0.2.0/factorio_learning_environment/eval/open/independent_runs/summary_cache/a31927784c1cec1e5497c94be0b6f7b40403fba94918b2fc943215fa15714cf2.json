{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-44.5, -124.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (-40.5, -113.5)\n- Pipe Group connecting these entities, with pipes at positions including (-47.5, -122.5), (-46.5, -123.5), (-42.5, -123.5), and (-42.5, -122.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-15.0, -76.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at Position (-15.5, -77.5)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-19.0, -73.0)\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0)\n\n### Additional Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0)\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) connected to a Wooden Chest at Position (6.5, -59.5)\n\n### Storage and Power Infrastructure\n- Wooden Chests at Positions (-15.5, -77.5), (7.5, -61.5), and (6.5, -59.5)\n- Small Electric Poles throughout the area, including positions such as (-39.5, -116.5), (-38.5, -115.5), and (5.5, -60.5)\n\n### Research Facility\n- Lab with input for automation science packs, currently not powered.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure that all entities intended to be connected by pipes are properly aligned and have no obstructions. Check for any misplaced pipes that could block the connection.\n\n### Errors with Placement Blockage\n- Before placing an entity, verify that the target tile is unoccupied and suitable for the entity type. This will prevent placement errors due to blockage.\n\n### Errors with Power Connectivity\n- Ensure that all electrical entities are connected to a power network. Check the connections between poles and ensure that there are no gaps in the power grid."}
