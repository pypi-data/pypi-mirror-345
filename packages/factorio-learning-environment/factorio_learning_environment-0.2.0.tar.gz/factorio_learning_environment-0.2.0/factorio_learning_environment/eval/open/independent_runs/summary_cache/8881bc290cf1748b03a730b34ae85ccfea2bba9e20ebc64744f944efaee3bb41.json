{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nCurrently, there are no structures successfully placed on the map. All attempts to place entities such as Burner Mining Drills, Stone Furnaces, and other components have failed, resulting in no established structures.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied or invalid locations\n- Ensure that the target location for placing entities like Burner Mining Drills, Stone Furnaces, and Wooden Chests is unoccupied and suitable for the entity's size and type. Verify the terrain and space availability before attempting to place an entity.\n\n### Errors due to incorrect BuildingBox size\n- When determining positions for entities like Burner Mining Drills, ensure the BuildingBox size is appropriate for the available space. Consider using smaller BuildingBoxes or adjusting the size to fit the available area.\n\n### Errors in setup not producing expected outputs\n- If a setup is not producing additional iron plates or other expected outputs, double-check the configuration and connections between entities. Ensure all necessary components are correctly placed and connected to function as intended.\n\n### Errors when extracting or interacting with non-existent entities\n- Before attempting to interact with or extract from entities, confirm their existence at the specified location. Use functions to verify the presence of entities like Stone Furnaces before performing operations.\n\n### General placement errors\n- Repeated errors indicate issues with placement logic. Review the logic and conditions used to determine placement positions to avoid repeated failed attempts."}
