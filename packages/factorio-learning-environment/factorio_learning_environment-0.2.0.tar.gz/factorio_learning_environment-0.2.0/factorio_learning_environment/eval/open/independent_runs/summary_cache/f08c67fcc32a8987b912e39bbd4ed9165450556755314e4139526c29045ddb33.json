Its fluid box contains water (amount \u2248190.35, temperature 15) with connection points at (-5.5, 22.5) and (-5.5, 26.5), and it is assigned fluid_system [156915] with a steam output at (-7.5, 24.5).\n- Offshore Pump at position(-9.5, 24.5) for water intake; status WORKING; its fluid box holds water (amount \u224899.24, temperature 15) operating on fluid_system [156915].\n- Wooden chest at position(-4.5, 25.5) serving as the manual fuel feeding system.\n- Pipeline Network consisting of:\n   - PipeGroup at position(-5.5, 19.5) with fluid_system = 156915, status WORKING.\n   - PipeGroup at position(-2.5, 19.5) with fluid_system = 156914, status EMPTY.\n   - PipeGroup at position(5.5, 21.5) with fluid_system = 156927, status EMPTY.\n   - PipeGroup at position(1.5, 23.5) with fluid_system = 156926, status EMPTY.\n   - PipeGroup at position(-7.5, 25.5) with fluid_system = 156922, status EMPTY.\n   - PipeGroup at position(0.5, 24.5) with fluid_system = 156931, status EMPTY.\n   - PipeGroup at position(1.5, 25.5) with fluid_system = 156930, status EMPTY.\n   - PipeGroup at position(1.5, 27.5) with fluid_system = 156933, status EMPTY.\n   - PipeGroup at position(4.5, 27.5) with fluid_system = 156934, status EMPTY.\n   - PipeGroup at position(-0.5, 28.5) with fluid_system = 156935, status EMPTY.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 Inconsistent Fluid System Identifier Usage:\n  - Multiple connection attempts near position (-5.5, 19.5) using fluid_system identifiers 156251, 156335, 156417, 156501, 156583, 156667, 156749, and 156833 resulted in no candidate pipe group.\n  - Tip: Verify and consistently use a unified, validated fluid_system identifier\u2014in this configuration, [156915] is confirmed in the final entities.\n\n\u2022 Repeated Unsuccessful Candidate Searches:\n  - Consecutive searches for candidate pipe groups without pre-validation led to repeated aborted connection attempts.\n  - Tip: Implement a pre-check to confirm candidate availability in the target area before initiating connection operations.\n\n\u2022 Unused Validated Candidate:\n  - Despite the existence of a confirmed valid pipe group (fluid_system 156915), alternate identifiers were repeatedly attempted.\n  - Tip: Once a valid candidate is identified, reapply its identifier consistently to avoid redundant failures."}
