{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Setup at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0)\n  - Refueled with coal and actively mining iron ore.\n  - Connected to a wooden chest at position (-14.5, -48.5).\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5)\n  - Contains iron ore and serves as a buffer between the mining drill and the furnace.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5)\n  - Transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the stone furnace.\n  - Requires coal for operation.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0)\n  - Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates.\n  - Currently not receiving iron ore due to inserter setup issues.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities too far from the player\n- Ensure the player is within the maximum allowed distance (10 tiles) from the target position before placing any entity.\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Verify that the target tile is free of other entities or obstacles before attempting to place a new entity. Consider adjusting the spacing, direction, or reference position if placement fails.\n\n### Errors with inserter alignment and functionality\n- Double-check the alignment and direction of inserters to ensure they are correctly positioned to transfer items between entities.\n- Ensure inserters are adequately fueled to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Errors due to full chests\n- Regularly monitor and empty chests to prevent mining drills from halting due to full output chests.\n\n### Furnace not receiving ingredients\n- Investigate and correct the setup of inserters and chests to ensure the furnace receives the necessary ingredients for smelting."}
