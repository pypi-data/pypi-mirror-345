{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-46.5, -123.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-46.5, -123.5)\n- Steam Engine at position (-40.5, -113.5)\n- Small Electric Poles connecting the steam engine to the power network, with positions ranging from (-49.5, -108.5) to (-3.5, -86.5)\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -76.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-15.5, -77.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -73.0) for smelting, currently processing copper ore\n\n### Additional Furnaces\n- Stone Furnace at position (9.0, -64.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n- Stone Furnace at position (6.0, -62.0) processing iron plates\n\n### Inserter and Chest Assembly\nConsists of:\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) not receiving electricity\n- Wooden Chest at position (7.5, -61.5) storing iron plates\n- Wooden Chest at position (6.5, -59.5) storing iron ore and iron plates\n\n### Laboratory\n- Lab with input of automation science packs, currently not powered\n\n### Pipe Networks\nMultiple PipeGroups with positions and statuses indicating they are empty, such as:\n- PipeGroup at position (-35.5, -122.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (-48.5, -112.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (-37.5, -111.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (-42.5, -109.5)\n- Other PipeGroups in various positions, all empty\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Reconnecting Pipes\n- Ensure that the path for pipe connections is clear of any blockages before attempting to reconnect pipes. Check for any entities or terrain features that might be obstructing the connection path.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Power Supply\n- Verify that inserters are within range of powered electric poles to ensure they receive electricity. Adjust the position of electric poles or inserters as necessary to establish a connection.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Input\n- Make sure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Regularly check the input inventory of furnaces and supply them with the required resources to maintain production."}
