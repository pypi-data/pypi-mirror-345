Move to a valid position if the initial position is blocked.\n\n### Errors when connecting pipes\n- Verify that the target pipe is not blocked by other entities before attempting to connect. If a connection fails, reassess the layout and ensure there are no obstructions.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
