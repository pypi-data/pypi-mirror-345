{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone Furnace at position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace (position 0.0, 0.0) which processes Iron Ore into Iron Plates.\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position(42.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position 42.0, -83.0) which extracts resources from the ground.\n- Burner Inserter (position 43.5, -81.5) which moves coal from the Wooden Chest to the Burner Mining Drill.\n- Wooden Chest (position 42.5, -81.5) which stores coal.\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position(-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position -15.0, -50.0) which extracts resources from the ground.\n- Wooden Chest (position -14.5, -48.5) which stores Iron Ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items into the furnace\n- Ensure that the furnace is not full before attempting to insert items. The furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) has shown warnings indicating that both the source and result inventories are full.\n\n### Errors when inserting coal into the Burner Mining Drill\n- Ensure that you have enough coal in your inventory before attempting to insert it into the Burner Mining Drill. An error occurred when trying to insert coal into the drill at position (42.0, -83.0) due to insufficient coal in the inventory.\n\n### Errors due to full chests\n- The Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) cannot operate because the chest at (-14.5, -48.5) is full. Make sure to empty the chest to allow the mining drill to function properly.\n\n### General Tips\n- Always check the status of your entities before performing actions to avoid unnecessary errors.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `insert_item(prototype, entity, quantity)`: This function is used to insert items into entities. It failed when attempting to insert coal due to insufficient inventory.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `burner_mining_drill_1`: Entity of type `BurnerMiningDrill`.\n- `burner_mining_drill_2`: Entity of type `BurnerMiningDrill`.\n- `stone_furnace`: Entity of type `StoneFurnace`.\n- `wooden_chest`: Entity of type `WoodenChest`.\n- `coal`: Variable of type `int`, tracking the amount of coal available in the inventory."}
