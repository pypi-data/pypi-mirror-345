{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing Facility at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0) extracting coal with a fuel inventory of 17 coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=41.5, y=-83.5) transferring coal from the mining drill to a wooden chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=40.5, y=-83.5) serving as an intermediary storage for coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=42.5, y=-83.5) storing 274 units of coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=41.5, y=-80.5) transferring coal to another wooden chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=41.5, y=-79.5) storing 204 units of coal.\n- BeltGroup connecting the chests and facilitating coal transport.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with a fuel inventory of 10 coal, processing iron ore into iron plates.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=2.0, y=0.0) with a fuel inventory of 5 coal, processing iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entity for the inserter (e.g., mining drill or chest) has items available for transfer. Check the status and inventory of the source entity to prevent the inserter from idling.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
