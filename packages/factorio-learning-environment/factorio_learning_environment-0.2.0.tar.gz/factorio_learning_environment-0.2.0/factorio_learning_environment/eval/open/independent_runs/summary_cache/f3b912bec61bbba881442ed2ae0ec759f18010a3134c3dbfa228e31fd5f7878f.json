{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) with coal fuel, currently working, dropping resources to a stone furnace.\n- Stone Furnace at position (41.0, -80.0) with coal fuel, but no ingredients to smelt, indicating a lack of input materials.\n\n### Iron Plate Mine at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) without fuel, currently not operational due to no fuel, dropping resources to a wooden chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) for storing mined resources.\n\n### Copper Furnace at Position (-20.0, -71.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -71.0) with coal fuel, but no ingredients to smelt, indicating a lack of input materials.\n\n### Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (43.5, -79.5) for storing items, currently empty.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Insufficient Inventory Items\n- Ensure you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into machines. For example, attempting to insert coal into the iron drill and iron furnace failed due to a lack of coal in the inventory.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Ingredients in Furnaces\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to process. Both the stone furnace at (41.0, -80.0) and the stone furnace at (-20.0, -71.0) are not operational due to a lack of ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Fuel in Mining Drills\n- Ensure that mining drills have sufficient fuel to operate. The burner mining drill at (-15.0, -50.0) is not operational due to no fuel.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `insert_item`: Used to insert items into entities. Ensure the item exists in the inventory before calling this function to prevent errors.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `iron_drill`: Represents the iron mining drill entity.\n- `iron_furnace`: Represents the iron furnace entity.\n- `copper_mining_drill`: Represents the copper mining drill entity.\n- `copper_furnace`: Represents the copper furnace entity."}
