{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at position(x=-10.0, y=-50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position(x=-10.0, y=-50.0) fueled with coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position(x=-10.5, y=-48.5) transferring items to the furnace.\n- Burner Inserter at position(x=-7.5, y=-49.5) transferring items to a wooden chest.\n- Burner Inserter at position(x=-5.5, y=-49.5) awaiting items for transfer.\n- Wooden Chest at position(x=-8.5, y=-49.5) for storage.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Operation at position(x=-14.0, y=-53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position(x=-14.0, y=-53.0) extracting iron ore.\n- BeltGroup connecting the mining drill to other parts of the production line.\n\n### Belt System\nConsists of multiple BeltGroups and individual belts:\n- BeltGroup with inputs from position(x=-21.5, y=-51.5) to (x=-19.5, y=-51.5) and outputs from (x=-18.5, y=-49.5) to (x=-16.5, y=-49.5).\n- BeltGroup with inputs from position(x=-17.5, y=-50.5) to (x=-17.5, y=-52.5) and outputs from (x=-16.5, y=-55.5) to (x=-14.5, y=-55.5).\n- Individual belts connecting various parts of the production line.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting belts directly to entities\n- Ensure you use an inserter when attempting to connect belts to entities like Stone Furnace or Wooden Chest. Belts cannot be directly connected to these entities.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient inventory items\n- Before attempting to insert items into entities, verify that you have the necessary items in your inventory to avoid insertion errors.\n\n### Errors when refueling entities without sufficient fuel\n- Always check your inventory for sufficient fuel before attempting to refuel entities like mining drills and furnaces to prevent operation failures."}
