{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=20.5, y=-4.0)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (x=22.5, y=-7.5)\n- Boiler at Position (x=20.5, y=-4.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (x=4.5, y=-10.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the boiler and steam engine\n\n### Copper Cable Factory\nConsists of:\n- Assembling Machine at Position (x=10.5, y=0.5)\n- Inserter at Position (x=-3.5, y=1.5) that puts items into the assembling machine\n- Small Electric Pole network providing power to the assembling machine and inserter\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (x=-11.0, y=20.0)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=2.0, y=0.0)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (x=-11.5, y=18.5) for storing iron ore\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=5.0, y=5.0)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Assembling Machine Not Working\n- Ensure that the assembling machine has the necessary ingredients and is powered. Check the recipe and input inventory to confirm that all required items are available.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Verify that the inserter has access to the required source items. Ensure that the source entity is correctly positioned and contains the necessary items for the inserter to function.\n\n### Boiler Out of Fuel\n- Regularly refuel the boiler to maintain continuous operation. Monitor fuel levels and automate refueling if possible to prevent interruptions.\n\n### Furnace No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Ensure that the furnace is supplied with the necessary raw materials. Check the input inventory and automate the supply chain to maintain a steady flow of ingredients."}
