{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nNo structures have been successfully created on the map. All attempts to place entities have failed, resulting in no existing structures to report.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure that the target tile is unoccupied before attempting to place an entity. Multiple attempts to place entities such as Wooden Chests, Stone Furnaces, ore inserters, plate inserters, and output chests have failed due to occupied tiles.\n\n### Errors during movement\n- Verify that the movement commands are correctly formatted and that the target positions are valid. Errors such as \"Cannot move. string indices must be integers, not 'str'\" indicate issues with the movement command format.\n\n### Errors when requesting paths\n- Ensure that the pathfinding requests are valid and that the goal positions are correctly specified. Errors like \"Could not get path from x=199.5 y=199.5 to x=400.5 y=400.0\" suggest issues with pathfinding requests.\n\n### General placement errors\n- Double-check the coordinates and ensure that the buildable area is correctly identified before attempting to place entities. Attempts to place entities in various positions have consistently failed, indicating potential issues with coordinate validation or buildable area identification."}
