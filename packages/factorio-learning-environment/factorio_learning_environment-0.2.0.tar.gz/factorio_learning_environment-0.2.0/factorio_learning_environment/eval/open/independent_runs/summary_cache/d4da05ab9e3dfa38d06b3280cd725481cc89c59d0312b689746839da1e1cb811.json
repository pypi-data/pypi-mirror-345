{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Stone Furnace at position (1.0, 1.0)\nConsists solely of the stone furnace entity used for smelting ores into metal plates. This furnace has processed both iron ore (for iron plates) and attempted copper ore smelting. It has experienced multiple inventory management issues, including skipped coal insertions due to absent coal and capacity conflicts when attempting to insert copper ore.\n\n### Wooden Chest at position (2.5, 2.5)\nConsists solely of the wooden chest entity used for inventory storage and management, unchanged from previous reports.\n\n### Laboratory Complex with Associated Power Generator\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab at position (10.5, 10.5) used for research that requires specific inventories and power to operate.\n- SteamEngine at position (8.5, 10.5) serving as a power generator placed in proximity to the Lab.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 Placement and Collision Errors\n  - Lab placement failed initially due to an occupied tile at (3.0, 3.0). Ensure the intended placement area is clear of other entities before positioning a lab.\n\n\u2022 Insufficient Ingredient Handling in Crafting Processes\n  - Repeated failures in crafting SteamEngine indicate missing sub-ingredients, specifically shortages in iron-plate, iron-gear-wheel, and pipe components. Verify that the furnace\u2019s output is sufficient, and monitor inventory levels for components before reattempting craft. \n  - Similarly, crafting of SmallElectricPole failed because of missing copper-cable due to absent copper-plate production in the furnace. Ensure all smelting requirements and inventories are met prior to formula initiation.\n\n\u2022 Furnace Operation and Insertions\n  - Multiple occurrences of skipped coal insertion signal that fuel management is not aligned with furnace operations. Check inventory for coal before attempting fuel insertions.\n  - Inserting different ore types into the same furnace led to conflicts (i.e. copper ore insertion failed when iron ore was present). Empty or manage furnace inventory appropriately between different ore smelting tasks.\n  \n\u2022 Grouped Crafting Prerequisite Issues\n  - Crafting errors related to electronic circuits, iron-gear-wheels, and steam engines share a common pattern of unmet sub-ingredient prerequisites. Maintain a balance between smelting outputs and component crafting needs to avoid cascading errors.\n\n"}
