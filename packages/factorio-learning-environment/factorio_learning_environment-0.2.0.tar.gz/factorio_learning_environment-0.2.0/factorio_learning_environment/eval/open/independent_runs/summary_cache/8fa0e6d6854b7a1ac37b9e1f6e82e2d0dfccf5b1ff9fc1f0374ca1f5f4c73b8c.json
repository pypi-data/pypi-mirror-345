{"content": "## Report\n\n### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Steam Power Generation System\n- **Boiler** at position (-3.5, 26.0) generating steam.\n- **Offshore Pump** at position (-7.5, 25.5) supplying water.\n- **Pipes** connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and extending from x=-2.0 to x=16.0 along y=23.5.\n- **Steam Engine** at position (35.5, 27.5) intended to generate electricity, but currently not operational.\n\n#### Iron Plate Production Facility\n- **Furnaces** at positions (0.0, 0.0), (10.0, 0.0), (13.0, 0.0), and (16.0, 0.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserters** at positions (8.5, 0.5), (17.5, 0.5), (19.5, 0.5), and (20.5, 0.5) for moving items between chests and furnaces.\n- **Chests** at positions (8.5, -0.5), (17.5, -0.5), (19.5, -0.5), and (20.5, -0.5) for storing raw materials and finished products.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when placing pipes\n- Ensure there is no obstruction in the path where pipes need to be placed. Clear any existing objects before attempting to place pipes.\n- Verify that the terrain is suitable for pipe placement, avoiding areas with water or other unplaceable terrain.\n\n#### Steam Engine Connectivity Issues\n- Confirm that the steam engine is properly connected to the power network. Check connections and ensure all necessary components are linked.\n- Ensure that the steam engine is receiving steam from the boiler. Verify pipe connections between the boiler and steam engine.\n\n#### Incorrect Use of API\n- When placing underground pipes, use the correct attribute 'PipeGroup' instead of 'PipeToGround'.\n- Ensure that the correct items are available in the inventory before attempting to place them, such as express-underground-belts."}
