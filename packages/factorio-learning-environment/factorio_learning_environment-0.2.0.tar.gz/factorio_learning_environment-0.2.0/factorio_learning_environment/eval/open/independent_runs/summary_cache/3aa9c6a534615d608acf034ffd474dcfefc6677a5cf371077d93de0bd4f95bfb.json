{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0) used for smelting iron ore into iron plates. Currently fueled with coal and working with 19 units of iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (1.5, 0.5) transferring iron plates from the stone furnace to a wooden chest. It is fueled with coal and is in working status. The pickup position is (0.5, 0.5) and the drop position is (2.5, 0.5).\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (2.5, 0.5) storing iron plates. It currently holds 16 iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (4.5, 0.5) intended to transfer items from a belt to a chest, but currently waiting for source items. It is fueled with coal. The pickup position is (5.5, 0.5) and the drop position is (3.5, 0.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied positions\n- Ensure that the target position for placing an entity is free from other entities or items. Consider increasing the spacing, changing the direction, or adjusting the reference position to avoid collisions.\n\n### Errors when connecting belts directly to chests\n- Use an inserter to input items into a chest instead of directly connecting belts to a chest. Belts cannot be directly connected to storage entities like chests.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient inventory items\n- Before attempting to place or craft entities, ensure that you have the required items in your inventory. For example, attempting to place a burner inserter when none are available in the inventory will result in an error.\n\n### Errors when crafting items without required sub-ingredients\n- Verify that all necessary sub-ingredients are available before crafting complex items. For instance, crafting transport belts requires iron plates, which must be smelted in a furnace or crafted in a machine.\n\n### Errors when inserting items without having them in inventory\n- Ensure that you have the items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity, such as a furnace."}
