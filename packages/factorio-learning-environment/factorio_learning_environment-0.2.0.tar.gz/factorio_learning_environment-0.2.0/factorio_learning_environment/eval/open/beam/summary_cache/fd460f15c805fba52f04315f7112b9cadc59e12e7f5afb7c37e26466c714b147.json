However, my current inventory still does not include any iron plates, as I have not extracted them yet. The current inventory is as follows:\n- **Coal**: 5 units\n- **Stone**: 10 units\n- **Copper Cables**: 18 units\n- **Iron Gear Wheels**: 2 units\n\n### Current Furnace Status:\n- **Iron Ore**: 2 units remaining\n- **Iron Plate**: 1 unit produced\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Extract the iron plate from the furnace**.\n2. **Craft additional iron gear wheels**: Each iron gear wheel requires 2 iron plates. To craft 18 iron gear wheels, I will need a total of 36 iron plates.\n3. **Continue smelting the remaining iron ore** to produce more iron plates.\n\nLet's proceed to extract the iron plate from the furnace.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Extract the produced iron plate from the furnace\nextract_item(Prototype.IronPlate, furnace.position, quantity=1)  # Extract the 1 produced iron plate\n\n# Check the status of the furnace and current inventory after extraction\nprint(f\"Furnace Status after extraction: {inspect_inventory(furnace)}\")  # Check the furnace status\nprint(f\"Current Inventory after extraction: {inspect_inventory()}\")  # Check inventory after extraction\n\n# Update total iron plates after extraction\ntotal_iron_plates = inspect_inventory()[Prototype.IronPlate]\nprint(f\"Total Iron Plates Available now: {total_iron_plates}\")\n\n# Now check if I can continue smelting the remaining iron ore\nif total_iron_plates < 36:  # We need to craft 36 iron plates total for 18 iron gear wheels\n    insert_item(Prototype.IronOre, furnace, quantity=2)  # Insert the remaining iron ore\n\n# Check the status of the furnace after adding more iron ore\nprint(f\"Furnace Status after adding remaining iron ore: {inspect_inventory(furnace)}\")  # Check furnace status after operation\n\n# Sleep for a brief period to allow smelting to progress\nsleep(5)  # Wait for 5 seconds for the smelting process to progress\nprint(\"Waiting for iron smelting to complete...\")\n\n# Check the status of the furnace again after the wait\nprint(f\"Furnace Status after waiting: {inspect_inventory(furnace)}\")  # Check the state of the furnace after some time\nprint(f\"Current Inventory after waiting: {inspect_inventory()}\")  # Check inventory status after waiting", "summary_range": "[1-80]"}
