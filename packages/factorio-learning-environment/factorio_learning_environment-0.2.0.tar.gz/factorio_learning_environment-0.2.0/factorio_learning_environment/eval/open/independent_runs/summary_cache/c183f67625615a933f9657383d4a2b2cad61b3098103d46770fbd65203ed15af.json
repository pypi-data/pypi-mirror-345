{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position(-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position -15.0, -50.0) which is currently working and requires coal as fuel.\n- Wooden Chest (position -14.5, -48.5) which stores iron ore extracted by the drill.\n\n### Stone Furnace at position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace (position 0.0, 0.0) which is currently working and processes iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Coal Patch at position(40.5, -82.5)\n- This is a resource area where coal can be harvested.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n- **Error when crafting coal**: Ensure that the recipe for coal is available before attempting to craft. Coal is a raw resource that must be gathered first.\n- **Errors when inserting into the Burner Mining Drill**: The drill may not be able to accept more fuel if the connected chest is full. Regularly check and empty the chest to avoid this issue.\n- **Errors when extracting from the chest**: Ensure that the chest is not empty before attempting to extract items. If the chest is empty, the extraction will fail.\n- **Errors when inserting into the furnace**: Make sure the furnace has the necessary ingredients before inserting items. If it shows \"NO_INGREDIENTS,\" it cannot process anything.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- **Utility Functions Defined**:\n  - `craft_item(item_type, quantity)`: This function failed to craft coal due to the absence of the recipe.\n  \n- **Important Variables Assigned**:\n  - `current_inventory`: Dictionary containing inventory items, type: `dict`\n    - Example values: `{'wood': 6, 'iron-ore': 27}` \n  - `nearest_coal_position`: Tuple representing the coordinates of the nearest coal, type: `tuple`\n    - Example value: `(40.5, -82.5)`\n  - `drill_status`: Status of the Burner Mining Drill, type: `EntityStatus`\n  - `furnace_status`: Status of the Stone Furnace, type: `EntityStatus`"}
