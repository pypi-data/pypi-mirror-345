{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-10.0, -48.0) and (-12.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnace at position (-10.0, -48.0):** Produces iron plates from iron ore. Currently has 3 units of coal as fuel and has produced 71 iron plates.\n- **Furnace at position (-12.0, -48.0):** Produces iron plates from iron ore. Currently has 8 units of coal as fuel and has produced 90 iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter at position (-8.5, -47.5):** Transfers items to and from the furnaces. Currently waiting for source items.\n- **Burner Inserter at position (-14.5, -47.5):** Transfers items to and from the furnaces. Currently working.\n- **Wooden Chest at position (-6.5, -48.5):** Stores iron plates. Contains 600 iron plates.\n- **Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -46.5):** Stores iron ore. Contains 3 iron ore.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0):** Extracts iron ore. Currently has 6 units of coal as fuel and is operational.\n- **Wooden Chest at position (-15.5, -48.5):** Stores extracted iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5):** Stores extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -48.5):** Transfers items from the mining drill to the chests. Currently waiting for space in destination.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Inserters Waiting for Space or Source Items\n- Ensure that the destination of inserters is not full before attempting to transfer items.\n- Verify that the source has items available for the inserter to pick up.\n\n### Errors Due to Inserters Being Out of Fuel\n- Regularly check the fuel levels of inserters and ensure they are refueled to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Errors When Refueling or Inserting Items Without Inventory Resources\n- Before attempting to insert items or refuel entities, ensure that the necessary resources are available in your inventory.\n\n### Errors Due to Mining Drill Being Out of Fuel\n- Monitor the fuel levels of mining drills and refuel them promptly to avoid interruptions in resource extraction."}
