Always use an inserter (or similar intermediary) that accepts items to serve as the belt\u2019s delivery target.\n\n\u2022 Placement Distance Error  \n  \u2013 If an entity cannot be placed because the target position is too far from the player (e.g. wooden-chest at (3.5, 15.5) with the player at (0, 0)), move closer to the target position to remain within the maximum placement range.\n\n\u2022 Inventory Availability Error  \n  \u2013 Before attempting to place an item (such as a wooden chest), confirm that the item is present in the inventory to avoid placement failures.\n\n\u2022 Variable Reference Error  \n  \u2013 Ensure all variables referenced (for example, using \u2018target_chest\u2019) are properly defined to prevent NameError issues during execution."}
