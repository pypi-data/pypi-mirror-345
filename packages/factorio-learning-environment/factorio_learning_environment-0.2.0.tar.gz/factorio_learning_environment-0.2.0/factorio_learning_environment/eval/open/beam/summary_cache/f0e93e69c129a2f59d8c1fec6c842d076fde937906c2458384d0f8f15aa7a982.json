{"content": "# Factorio Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position (0.0, 0.0)) with fuel (29 coal) and currently smelting copper plates. \n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position (61.0, -54.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position (61.0, -54.0)) with fuel (6 coal) and operational status.\n\n### Wooden Chest at position (60.5, -55.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest (position (60.5, -55.5)) containing 139 units of stone.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to crafting items\n- Ensure you have all required resources in your inventory before attempting to craft items. You encountered errors when trying to craft automation science packs and copper cables due to insufficient copper plates.\n- Check that you have gathered enough raw materials (like stone) needed for crafting sub-ingredients (like stone furnaces).\n\n### Errors when inserting items into entities\n- Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before trying to insert them into entities. You encountered an error when attempting to insert copper ore into the stone furnace without having copper ore available.\n\n### Errors when attempting to craft with insufficient resources\n- Always verify your current inventory and available resources before trying to craft items to avoid \"Not enough resources\" errors.\n\n### Errors related to undefined variables\n- Make sure all variables are properly defined before use, as seen with the error regarding 'gear_wheel_ingredients' not being defined.\n\n### Errors when using incorrect data types\n- Ensure that the data types used in your code are correct. For example, avoid using strings where objects are expected, which led to the AttributeError regarding 'str' objects.\n\n### Errors when smelting timeout occurs\n- Ensure that the furnace has both fuel and the required input items to prevent smelting timeouts.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing. You encountered an error when trying to place a wooden chest without having it in your inventory.\n\n### Errors when extracting items from entities\n- Ensure that the entity you are trying to extract from contains the required items. You encountered errors when attempting to extract copper plates from the stone furnace, which had no copper plates available.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when trying to extract items with incorrect data types\n- Ensure that the resource you are trying to extract is correctly referenced and not a string, as seen with the repeated AttributeError regarding 'str' objects.\n\n### Errors related to extracting items from the Burner Mining Drill\n- Ensure that the extraction command is correctly referencing the resource and its drop position. The repeated AttributeError indicates a problem with how the resource is being accessed.\n\n### Errors related to crafting machines not being unlocked\n- Research the required technology before attempting to craft items that depend on it. You encountered an error when trying to craft an assembling machine without having unlocked the automation technology.\n\n### Errors related to insufficient resources for research\n- Ensure you have enough automation science packs to conduct research. You encountered an error due to not having enough packs to research Automation technology."}
