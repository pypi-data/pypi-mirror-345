{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0), which is currently out of fuel and has a resource of coal (20,000 units).\n- Stone Furnace at position (41.0, -80.0), which is out of fuel and has no ingredients to smelt.\n- Wooden Chest at position (43.5, -79.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0), which is currently out of fuel and has a resource of iron ore (10,000 units).\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5).\n\n### Copper Furnace at Position (-20.0, -71.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -71.0), which is out of fuel and has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Insufficient Inventory\n- Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into any entity. For instance, trying to insert coal when there is none in the inventory will lead to an error.\n\n### Errors with Fuel Management\n- Regularly check and refuel entities such as mining drills and furnaces to prevent them from running out of fuel and halting production.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `insert_item`: This function attempts to insert a specified quantity of an item into a target entity. It failed when the item was not available in the inventory.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `iron_furnace`: Represents the iron furnace entity.\n- `copper_furnace`: Represents the copper furnace entity."}
