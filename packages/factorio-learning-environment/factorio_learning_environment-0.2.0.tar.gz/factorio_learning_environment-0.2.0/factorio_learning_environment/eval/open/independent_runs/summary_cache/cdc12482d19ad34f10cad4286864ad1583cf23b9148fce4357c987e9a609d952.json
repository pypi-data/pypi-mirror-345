{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=5.5, y=21.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=5.5, y=21.5), connected to the power network and generating power.\n- Boiler at position (x=-1.5, y=24.0), fueled with coal and working.\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5), working and supplying water.\n- PipeGroup connecting the Offshore Pump to the Boiler and the Boiler to the Steam Engine, facilitating the flow of water and steam.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0), (x=10.0, y=0.0), (x=13.0, y=0.0), and (x=16.0, y=0.0), fueled with coal but currently with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Burner Inserters at positions (x=8.5, y=0.5), (x=17.5, y=0.5), (x=19.5, y=0.5), and (x=20.5, y=0.5), waiting for source items, positioned to feed the furnaces.\n\n### Research Lab\nConsists of the following entity:\n- Lab at position (not specified), currently working on logistics research with automation science packs.\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- PipeGroup at position (x=-0.5, y=11.5), status empty.\n- PipeGroup at position (x=-9.5, y=23.5), status working, transporting water.\n- PipeGroup at position (x=-0.5, y=22.5), status working, transporting steam.\n- PipeGroup at position (x=-6.5, y=25.5), status empty.\n\n### Electrical Network\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at various positions, providing power distribution.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure there are no obstructions in the path when attempting to connect pipes between entities. Clear any obstructing pipes or entities before attempting to connect.\n- Verify that the correct type of pipe (e.g., Pipe vs. UndergroundPipe) is being used for the intended connection.\n\n### Errors with Pipe Placement\n- Avoid placing pipes where there is a blockage. Ensure the path is clear for pipe placement to connect entities successfully.\n\n### Steam Engine Not Generating Power\n- Ensure all connections from the offshore pump to the boiler and from the boiler to the steam engine are correctly established and free of blockages.\n- Check that the boiler is fueled and operational to produce steam for the steam engine.\n\n### General Connection Failures\n- Double-check the alignment and connectivity of all entities involved in the power generation process to ensure they are correctly configured and connected."}
