{"content": "## Report\n\n### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Electricity Generator at Position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Steam Engine** at position (x=17.5, y=20.5) with warnings of 'no input liquid' and 'no fluid present in connections'.\n- **Boiler** at position (x=1.5, y=23.0) with a warning of 'out of fuel'. It has a steam output point at position (x=1.5, y=21.5).\n- **Offshore Pump** at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5) which is working and connected to a pipe at position (x=-9.5, y=23.5).\n\n#### Pipe Networks\n- **Pipe Group** (fluid system 77068) starting at position (x=3.5, y=17.5) and ending at position (x=10.5, y=21.5), currently empty.\n- **Pipe Group** (fluid system 77079) starting at position (x=-9.5, y=23.5) and ending at position (x=-0.5, y=23.5), currently full with water.\n\n#### Electricity Network\n- **Electricity Group** with poles distributed across various positions including (x=27.5, y=26.5), (x=3.5, y=20.5), (x=14.5, y=20.5), and others, with a voltage of 0.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors with Steam Engine Connection\n- Ensure that all necessary fluid connections to the steam engine are established to avoid 'no input liquid' and 'no fluid present in connections' warnings.\n\n#### Boiler Fuel Management\n- Regularly check and refuel the boiler to prevent 'out of fuel' status and maintain continuous operation.\n\n#### Fluid System Management\n- Monitor fluid levels in pipe groups to ensure they are not empty when needed for operations."}
