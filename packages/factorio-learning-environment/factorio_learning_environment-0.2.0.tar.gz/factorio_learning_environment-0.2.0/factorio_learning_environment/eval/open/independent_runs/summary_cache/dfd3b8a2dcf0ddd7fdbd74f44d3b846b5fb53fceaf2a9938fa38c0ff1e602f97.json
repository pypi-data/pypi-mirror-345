{"content": "I'll create a report based on the provided logs:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Smelting System\nLocated around y=-80, consists of:\n- Two stone furnaces at positions (45.0, -80.0) and (47.0, -80.0)\n- Input inserters at (45.5, -78.5) and (47.5, -78.5)\n- Output inserters at (45.5, -81.5) and (47.5, -81.5)\n- Input chests at (45.5, -77.5) and (47.5, -77.5)\n- Output chests at (45.5, -82.5) and (47.5, -82.5)\n- Additional storage chests at (49.5, -79.5) and (49.5, -80.5)\nStatus: Automated and self-sustaining, currently idle due to no input materials\n\n### Coal Mining System\nLocated around y=-83, consists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (40.0, -82.0)\n- Fuel inserter at (40.5, -83.5)\n- Transport belt system from y=-86.5 to y=-83.5\n- Wooden chest at (45.5, -84.5)\nStatus: Automated and self-sustaining, currently waiting for belt space\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Belt System Issues\n- Ensure belts are properly oriented in the intended direction before placing items\n- Clear blocked belts before attempting to mine more materials\n- Verify belt connections and flow direction after placement\n\n### Space Management\n- Check for available space in destination entities before attempting transfers\n- Ensure output paths are clear and have proper collection systems\n- Monitor chest capacity to prevent overflow conditions\n\n### Entity Placement\n- Verify entity placement locations are clear before attempting to place new entities\n- Ensure proper spacing between related components\n- Check entity orientation matches intended input/output flow\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nImportant Variables:\n- None explicitly defined in provided logs\n\nFunctions:\n- None explicitly defined in provided logs\n\nThe systems appear to be functionally designed but experiencing some throughput issues due to space constraints and belt blockages. Both systems have the basic infrastructure for automation but require optimization of material flow."}
