{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES  \n\n#### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Operation (Updated)  \n- **Burner mining drills**:  \n  - At (16.0, 71.0) (`WORKING`, fuel: 6 coal, output blocked by ground items).  \n  - At (19.0, 71.0) and (22.0, 71.0) (`WORKING`, fuel: 11 coal each, output blocked).  \n- **Stone furnaces**:  \n  - At (16.0, 73.0) (`FULL_OUTPUT`, fuel: 49 coal, plates: 100/100).  \n  - At (19.0, 73.0) and (22.0, 73.0) (`WORKING`, fuel: 48 coal each, low ore input).  \n- **Output system**:  \n  - **Burner inserters** at (19.5, 74.5) and (22.5, 74.5) (`WORKING`).  \n  - **Wooden chests**:  \n    - (16.5, 75.5): 153 iron plates (full).  \n    - (19.5, 75.5): 272 iron plates (near capacity).  \n    - (22.5, 75.5): 270 iron plates (near capacity).  \n    - New chests at (20.5, 75.5) and (23.5, 75.5) (empty).  \n\n#### Power Generation Setup (Unchanged)  \n- **Offshore pump** at (-9.5, -0.5) with connected pipes.  \n- **Boiler** at (-7.0, 0.5) (`WORKING`).  \n- **Steam engine** still unplaced.  \n\n### ERROR TIPS  \n\n#### Persistent Placement Issues  \n- **Blocked inserter placement**: Repeated failures at (16.5, 72.5), (19.5, 72.5), (22.5, 72.5) due to existing objects (likely ore piles). Clear tiles with `remove_ground_items()` before placement.  \n\n#### Inventory Management  \n- **Furnace overflow**: Coal insertion attempts while fuel is full (50/50). Check inventory with `inspect_inventory(furnace)` before inserting.  \n- **Chest overflow**: Manual plate removal required. Add transport belts/inserters to route plates to new chests (20.5, 75.5) and (23.5, 75.5).  \n\n#### Production Bottlenecks  \n- **Drill output blocked**: All drills drop ore on ground. Place inserters at (16.5, 72.5), (19.5, 72.5), (22.5, 72.5) to feed furnaces.  \n- **Furnace inactivity**: Furnace at (16.0, 73.0) is full. Clear plates with `remove_item(Prototype.IronPlate, furnace)`.  \n\n#### Belt Connection Errors  \n- **Direct chest-to-belt connection**: Transport belts cannot connect directly to chests. Use inserters as intermediaries (e.g., inserter at (19.5, 75.5) \u2192 belt).  \n\n#### General Tips  \n- **Prioritize fuel stability**: Coal must reach all drills/furnaces.  \n- **Debug tools**: Use `debug` mode to inspect entity connections.  \n\n### NAMESPACE  \nNo new functions or variables were defined.  \n\n---  \n**Key Updates**:  \n- Added 2 chests for plate overflow (20.5, 75.5) and (23.5, 75.5).  \n- Furnace at (16.0, 73.0) halted due to full output (100 plates).  \n- Throughput dropped to 38 plates/minute due to unresolved bottlenecks."}
