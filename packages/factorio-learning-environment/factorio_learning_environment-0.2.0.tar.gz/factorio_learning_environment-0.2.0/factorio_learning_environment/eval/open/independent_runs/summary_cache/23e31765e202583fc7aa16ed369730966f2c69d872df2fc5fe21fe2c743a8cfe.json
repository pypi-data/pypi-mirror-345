For example, crafting iron gear wheels requires iron plates, which must be available.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing. Check for existing entities in the target position.\n\n### Errors related to inspecting furnace inventory\n- Always check the inventory of the furnace after performing extraction to ensure the expected items are present."}
