{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Transport System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) extracting coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (40.5, -83.5) used for storing extracted coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (41.5, -83.5) transferring coal from the wooden chest to the transport belt.\n- Transport Belt starting at position (42.5, -83.5) for transporting coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (41.5, -80.5) waiting for source items to transfer.\n- Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -79.5) for storing coal transported by the belt.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) used for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Stone Furnace at position (2.0, 0.0) used for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to blocked transport belt\n- Ensure that the transport belt at position (42.5, -83.5) is clear to allow the burner inserter to continue mining operations. Regularly check and clear any blockages on transport belts to maintain flow efficiency.\n\n### Errors due to inserter waiting for source items\n- Verify that the source items are available for the burner inserter at position (41.5, -80.5) to function. Ensure that the supply chain is uninterrupted and that all necessary resources are available at the source position."}
