Here\u2019s a summary of the outcomes:\n\n### Summary of Actions:\n1. **Removal of All Stone Furnaces**: \n   - Successfully removed all instances of stone furnaces from the map, confirming that the previous issues were not due to overlapping entities.\n   - **Confirmed Entities on Map**: The map is now clear of any stone furnaces.\n\n2. **Placement of New Stone Furnace**:\n   - A new stone furnace was placed at the distant position `(8.0, 0.0)`.\n   - **Furnace Details**: The new furnace is currently empty, with no fuel or ingredients loaded. It is reporting warnings of **\"out of fuel\"** and **\"no ingredients to smelt\"**.\n\n### Current Inventory Overview:\n- **Updated Inventory**:\n  - **10 pieces of stone furnaces** (indicating that additional furnaces may have been crafted).\n  - **15 pieces of coal** (indicating successful harvesting or collection).\n  - 5 pieces of stone.\n  - 5 pieces of iron ore.\n  - **21 pieces of iron plates** available.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Load Coal into the New Furnace**: I will insert some of the **15 pieces of coal** into the newly placed furnace to provide it with fuel.\n2. **Insert Ingredients for Smelting**: After loading coal, I will insert **some iron ore** or **copper ore** to begin processing.\n3. **Set the Recipe**: Finally, I will set the recipe for either Iron Plates or Copper Plates to ensure the furnace begins functioning.\n\nLet\u2019s proceed to load **5 pieces of coal** into the new furnace at `(8.0, 0.0)`. \n\"\"\"\n\n# Insert 5 pieces of coal into the newly placed furnace at (8.0, 0.0)\ninsert_item(Prototype.Coal, new_furnace_distant_location, quantity=5)  # Insert 5 pieces of coal into the new furnace\n\n# Check the inventory status of the new furnace after inserting coal\nnew_furnace_inventory_status_after_coal = inspect_inventory(new_furnace_distant_location)  # Inspect the status after loading coal\noverall_inventory_after_coal_insertion = inspect_inventory()  # Check overall inventory after loading coal.\n\nprint(f\"New Furnace inventory status after loading coal: {new_furnace_inventory_status_after_coal}\")  # Status after insertion of coal\nprint(f\"Overall current inventory after loading coal: {overall_inventory_after_coal_insertion}\")  # Total inventory after loading \n\n# Attempt to insert Iron Ore into the new furnace for processing\ninsert_item(Prototype.IronOre, new_furnace_distant_location, quantity=5)  # Insert 5 pieces of Iron Ore into the new furnace\n\n# Check the inventory status of the new furnace after inserting Iron Ore\nnew_furnace_inventory_status_after_iron_insertion = inspect_inventory(new_furnace_distant_location)  # Inspect the status after inserting Iron Ore\noverall_inventory_after_iron_insertion = inspect_inventory()  # Check overall inventory after inserting Iron Ore.\n\nprint(f\"New Furnace inventory status after loading Iron Ore: {new_furnace_inventory_status_after_iron_insertion}\")  # Status after insertion\nprint(f\"Overall current inventory after loading iron: {overall_inventory_after_iron_insertion}\")  # Total inventory after loading \n\n# Attempt to set the recipe in the new furnace for Iron Plates\nset_entity_recipe(new_furnace_distant_location, Prototype.IronPlate)  # Attempt to set the furnace to smelting Iron Plates now.", "summary_range": "[1-360]"}
