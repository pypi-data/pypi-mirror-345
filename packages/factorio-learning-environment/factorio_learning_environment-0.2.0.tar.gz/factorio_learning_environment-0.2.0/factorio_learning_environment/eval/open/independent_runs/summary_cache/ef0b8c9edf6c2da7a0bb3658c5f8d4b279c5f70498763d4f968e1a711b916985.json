{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=20.5, y=-4.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (x=19.5, y=-1.5)\n- Boiler at Position (x=20.5, y=-4.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (x=22.5, y=-7.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=2.0, y=0.0)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=5.0, y=5.0)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\n\n### Inserter and Storage System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Inserter at Position (x=-3.5, y=1.5)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (x=-3.5, y=0.5)\n- Small Electric Poles providing power to the inserter\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- PipeGroup with fluid system 5849, starting at Position (x=19.5, y=-12.5)\n- PipeGroup with fluid system 5850, starting at Position (x=5.5, y=-8.5), containing water\n- PipeGroup with fluid system 5856, starting at Position (x=18.5, y=-3.5)\n- PipeGroup with fluid system 5860, starting at Position (x=19.5, y=-2.5), containing water\n\n### Electricity Network\n- ElectricityGroup with ID 7312, consisting of small electric poles at various positions\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Boiler Not Receiving Water\n- Ensure that the boiler is correctly connected to a water source. Check the pipe connections between the offshore pump and the boiler to ensure water flow.\n\n### Steam Engine Not Receiving Fluid\n- Verify that the steam engine is properly connected to the boiler and that there is a continuous flow of steam from the boiler to the steam engine. Check for any breaks or misalignments in the pipe network.\n\n### Inserter Not Receiving Electricity\n- Ensure that the inserter is within the coverage area of an active power source. Check the connections of the small electric poles and ensure they are powered.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Ingredients\n- Check that the furnaces have the necessary raw materials to process. Ensure that inserters or belts are correctly feeding the furnaces with the required ingredients."}
