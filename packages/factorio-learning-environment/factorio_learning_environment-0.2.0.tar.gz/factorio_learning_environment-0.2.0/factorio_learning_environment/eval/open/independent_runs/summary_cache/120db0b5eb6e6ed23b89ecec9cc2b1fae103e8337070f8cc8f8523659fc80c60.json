{"content": "Based on the execution logs and entity data, I'll generate a report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Area (Position x=0-2, y=0)\nConsists of:\n- 2 stone furnaces for iron plate production at positions (0,0) and (2,0)\n- Both furnaces have coal fuel and iron plate output storage\n\n### Copper Plate Production Area (Position x=4, y=4)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace for copper plate production\n- Has coal fuel and copper plate output storage\n\n### Electronic Circuit Assembly Line (Position x=6.5-12.5, y=11.5)\nConsists of:\n- Input wooden chest at (6.5, 11.5)\n- Burner inserter at (7.5, 11.5) connecting input chest to assembling machine\n- Assembling machine 1 at (9.5, 11.5) for crafting electronic circuits\n- Burner inserter at (11.5, 11.5) connecting assembling machine to output chest\n- Output wooden chest at (12.5, 11.5) containing 278 electronic circuits\n\n### Power Generation System (Position x=-9.5 to -2.5, y=22.5-24.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe network connecting pump to boiler\n- Boiler at (-7.0, 24.5)\n- Steam engine at (-2.5, 24.5)\n- Connected to electrical network via power poles\n\n### Research Lab Setup (Position x=0.5, y=28.5-31.5)\nConsists of:\n- Lab at (0.5, 28.5)\n- Burner inserter at (0.5, 30.5)\n- Input wooden chest at (0.5, 31.5) containing:\n  - 53 automation science packs\n  - 57 logistic science packs\n\n### Electricity Distribution Network (ID: 28291)\nMultiple electric poles connecting power generation to consumers\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Access Errors\n- Cannot access lab at position (0.5, 28.5) - Ensure entity exists before trying to access it\n\n### Research Prerequisite Errors\n- Cannot research advanced technologies without completing prerequisites first\n- Research tree progression should be:\n  1. Engine\n  2. Fluid Handling\n  3. Oil Processing\n  4. Plastics\n  5. Advanced Electronics\n  6. Modules\n  7. Higher tier automation/productivity modules\n\n### Resource Management Errors\n- Monitor coal levels in boiler to prevent power outages\n- Ensure sufficient materials are available before attempting insertions\n\n### Power System Issues\n- Steam engine not receiving steam due to disconnected fluid network\n- Generator not connected to power network properly\n- Ensure complete fluid connections between boiler and steam engine"}
