{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Complex at (-10, -59)\nConsists of three mining drills in a row:\n- Burner mining drill at (-10, -59) feeding to chest at (-9.5, -57.5)\n- Burner mining drill at (-8, -59) feeding to chest at (-7.5, -57.5)  \n- Burner mining drill at (-6, -59) feeding to chest at (-5.5, -57.5)\nConnected by transport belts and burner inserters for ore movement\n\n### Copper Mining and Smelting at (-28, -61)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-28, -61)\n- Stone furnace at (-27, -59)\n- Burner inserter at (-25.5, -58.5)\n- Output chest at (-24.5, -58.5) containing iron and copper plates\n\n### Iron Smelting Array at (0, 0)\nConsists of:\n- 4 stone furnaces at (0,0), (2,0), (4,0), and (6,0)\n- Input chests at (0.5, -2.5), (2.5, -2.5), (4.5, -2.5), and (6.5, -2.5)\n- Output chests at (0.5, 2.5), (2.5, 2.5), (4.5, 2.5), and (6.5, 2.5)\n- Burner inserters moving materials between chests and furnaces\n\n### Additional Smelting Setup at (-23, -58)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnaces at (-23, -58) and (-21, -58)\n- Burner inserter at (-22.5, -56.5)\n- Output chest at (-22.5, -55.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting entities with transport belts\n- Cannot connect belts directly from a wooden chest - must use an inserter as an intermediary\n- Ensure proper entity connections when building belt systems\n\n### Entity placement warnings\n- Ensure output is not blocked by items on ground\n- Place appropriate sink entities to accept outputs from mining drills and inserters\n\n### Resource management\n- Monitor fuel levels in burner devices\n- Ensure proper coal distribution to all burner entities\n- Keep track of input/output chest contents to prevent blockages\n\n### Entity connection issues\n- Verify that entities are properly connected in the intended production chain\n- Check that inserters have valid pickup and drop positions"}
