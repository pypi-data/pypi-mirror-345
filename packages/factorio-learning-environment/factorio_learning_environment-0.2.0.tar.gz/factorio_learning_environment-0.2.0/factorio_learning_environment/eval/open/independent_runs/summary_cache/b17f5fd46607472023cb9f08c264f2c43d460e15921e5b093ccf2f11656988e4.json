{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generation at x=-9.5 y=-0.5\nThis structure generates electricity using steam power.\n-   **Offshore Pump** at position (x=-9.5, y=-0.5): Extracts water.\n-   **Boiler** at position (x=-5.0, y=2.5): Heats water into steam using coal.\n-   **Steam Engine** at position (x=0.5, y=6.5): Consumes steam to generate electricity. (Note: Currently not connected to any power network).\n-   **PipeGroup** connecting Offshore Pump to Boiler: Consists of pipes at [(x=-8.5,y=-0.5),(x=-7.5,y=-0.5),(x=-6.5,y=0.5),(x=-7.5,y=0.5),(x=-5.5,y=0.5)].\n-   **PipeGroup** connecting Boiler to Steam Engine: Consists of pipes at [(x=-3.5,y=3.5),(x=-3.5,y=2.5),(x=-2.5,y=5.5),(x=-3.5,y=5.5),(x=-3.5,y=4.5),(x=-2.5,y=6.5)].\n\n##"}
