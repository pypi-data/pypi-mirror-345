{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Collection and Transfer System at Position (x=42.0, y=-83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=42.0, y=-83.0) extracting coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=42.5, y=-81.5) transferring coal from the drill to a wooden chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=43.5, y=-80.5) collecting coal.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (x=-15.0, y=-49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-15.0, y=-49.0) processing iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities\n- Ensure that the intended position for placing entities like Wooden Chests and Burner Inserters is unoccupied. Check for existing objects that may block placement.\n\n### Errors with Entity Alignment\n- When aligning inserters with drills or chests, ensure that the drop and pickup positions are correctly set to prevent misalignment.\n\n### Type Errors in Code\n- Ensure that variables like `wooden_chest_width` and `wooden_chest_height` are correctly converted to integers before use in functions or assignments.\n\n### Errors Related to Output Blockage\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity in place to accept the output from drills to prevent blockage warnings.\n\n### Errors with Realigning Entities\n- When repositioning entities like inserters, ensure that the new positions are valid and do not overlap with existing entities."}
