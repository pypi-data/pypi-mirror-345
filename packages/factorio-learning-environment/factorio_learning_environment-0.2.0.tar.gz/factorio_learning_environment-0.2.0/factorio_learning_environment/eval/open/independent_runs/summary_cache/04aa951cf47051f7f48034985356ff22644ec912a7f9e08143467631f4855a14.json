Place additional pipes if necessary to bridge the gap.\n\n### Errors when placing pipes too far\n- Move closer to the target position before attempting to place a pipe. The maximum distance for placing pipes is 10 tiles.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors when attempting to connect pipes\n- Ensure that the pipe connections are valid and that there are no obstacles blocking the connection path. Check for existing entities in the way."}
