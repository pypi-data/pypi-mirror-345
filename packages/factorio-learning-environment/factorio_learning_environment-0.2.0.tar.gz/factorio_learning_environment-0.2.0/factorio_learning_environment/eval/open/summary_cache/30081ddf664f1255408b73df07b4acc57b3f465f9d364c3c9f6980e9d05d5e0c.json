{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron ore mining and smelting complex at position around (17.5, 72.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Electric mining drill at position (17.5, 72.5), facing down, currently powered and operational but output blocked due to lack of output sink.\n- Stone furnace at position (18.0, 75.0), fueled with coal and actively smelting iron ore.\n- Wooden chest at position (16.5, 75.5) used as output chest for the furnace.\n- Burner inserter at position (20.5, 75.5) with spacing 1, transferring iron plates from the furnace to the wooden chest.\n- Additional wooden chests at positions (19.5, 75.5) and (18.5, 76.5) present but placement attempts for new chests near furnace failed due to collisions.\n- Small electric pole at (17.5, 69.5) intended to power the electric mining drill, connected to the main power network.\n\n### Electricity generator at position around (0.5, 6.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, -0.5), drawing water.\n- Boiler at position (-5.0, 2.5), fueled with coal, connected to offshore pump by pipes.\n- Steam engine at position (0.5, 6.5), connected to boiler by pipes.\n- Small electric poles near boiler (at -4.5, -0.5) and near steam engine (at 0.5, 3.5), forming an electricity network.\n- Electricity network connects the power source at (0.5, 6.5) to the mining drill area at (17.5, 69.5) via poles.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to inserting items into entities\n- Avoid attempting to insert items into entities that do not accept them or when the entity\u2019s inventory is full, as seen with the failed insertion of coal into the mining drill.\n- Check entity inventory capacity and valid item types before insertion.\n\n### Errors when accessing attributes of electricity groups\n- The attribute 'energy' does not exist on ElectricityGroup objects; instead, check individual poles or power sources for energy or power status.\n- Use correct API calls to verify power availability on electric poles or generators.\n\n### Power supply and connectivity issues\n- The electric mining drill initially had no power due to lack of connection to a powered pole or power source.\n- Ensure power sources like steam engines are fueled and connected properly to the electric network.\n- Verify that poles are connected and powered before relying on them to power machines.\n\n### Errors placing entities due to collisions or occupied tiles\n- Multiple attempts to place wooden chests near the furnace failed because the target tiles were occupied by existing entities or the area was unsuitable (e.g., water tiles).\n- Before placing an entity, check for existing entities at the target position and ensure the tile is buildable.\n- Consider increasing spacing or changing placement direction to avoid collisions.\n\n### Errors placing inserters near chests\n- Placement of burner inserter next to furnace failed due to collision with an existing wooden chest.\n- When placing inserters or other entities near existing structures, verify available free space and adjust spacing or direction accordingly.\n\n### Fuel and operational warnings on power generation\n- Boiler ran out of fuel causing the steam engine to have no power input and not connected to the power network.\n- Always ensure boilers are supplied with fuel to maintain steam engine operation and stable power supply.\n\n### Output blockage warnings on mining drill and furnace\n- Mining drill output was blocked due to no sink entity to accept mined items.\n- Furnace output belt was blocked, causing warnings on the drill.\n- Ensure output belts and chests are properly placed and not blocked to maintain continuous production flow.\n\nNAMESPACE\nNo user-defined functions have been defined in the provided steps."}
