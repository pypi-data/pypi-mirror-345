{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nNo structures have been successfully created on the map as of the latest execution steps. All attempts to place entities such as wooden chests, burner inserters, and stone furnaces have failed due to placement errors.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure that the target position for placing an entity is clear and not occupied by other entities or obstacles. Verify the position is suitable for placement before attempting to place an entity.\n- Common positions where placement failed include:\n  - Wooden Chest at positions (0.0, 10.0), (10.0, 0.0), (0.0, 0.0), and (20.0, 20.0).\n  - Burner Inserter at position (-100.0, 100.0).\n  - Stone Furnace at position (50.0, 50.0).\n\n### Errors due to unclear placement positions\n- Before placing an entity, check the surrounding positions to ensure they are clear. Positions such as x=-0.5 y=-0.5, x=0.5 y=0.5, and others were reported as not clear for placement.\n- Consider moving to a different location or clearing the area if necessary before attempting to place entities.\n\nBy addressing these errors, the agent can improve its efficiency in setting up structures and avoid unnecessary placement failures."}
