{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=40.0, y=-84.0) extracting resources and transferring them to:\n  - **Wooden Chest** at position (x=41.5, y=-83.5) which temporarily stores extracted resources.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-15.0, y=-49.0) processing iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=54.5, y=-83.5) transferring items from:\n  - **Wooden Chest** at position (x=56.5, y=-83.5) storing iron plates.\n\n### Coal Transportation System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **BeltGroup** connecting various positions to transport coal:\n  - Belt from (x=50.5, y=-86.5) to (x=48.5, y=-86.5) in direction LEFT.\n  - Belt from (x=49.5, y=-86.5) to (x=47.5, y=-86.5) in direction LEFT.\n  - Belt from (x=43.5, y=-84.5) to (x=45.5, y=-84.5) in direction RIGHT.\n  - Belt from (x=45.5, y=-85.5) to (x=47.5, y=-85.5) in direction RIGHT.\n  - Belt from (x=52.5, y=-83.5) to (x=52.5, y=-85.5) in direction UP.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Mining Drill Output Blockage\n- Ensure that there are no items on the ground blocking the output of the mining drill. Regularly clear items from the ground to prevent blockage.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Operations\n- Verify that the inserter has a clear path to transfer items from the source to the destination. Ensure that the inserter is correctly aligned with the source and destination entities to avoid operational delays."}
