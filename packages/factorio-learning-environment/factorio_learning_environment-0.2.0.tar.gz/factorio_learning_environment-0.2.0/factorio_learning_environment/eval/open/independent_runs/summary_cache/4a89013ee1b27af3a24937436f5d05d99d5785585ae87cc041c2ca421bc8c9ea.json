{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-2.5, 24.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (-5.5, 19.5)\n- Boiler at position (-2.5, 24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe Group (steam) connecting various points, including positions like (-4.5, 16.5) and (-2.5, 22.5)\n- Pipe Group (water) connecting various points, including positions like (-9.5, 23.5) and (-4.5, 24.5)\n- Electricity Group with poles at positions (-7.5, 22.5), (-6.5, 22.5), and (-1.5, 20.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Production at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors When Using Extracting but Being Too Far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors When Placing into a Tile Which is Occupied by Another Entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Inventory Items\n- Always check your inventory to ensure you have the required items before attempting to place or connect entities. For example, ensure you have enough pipes before attempting to connect entities with them.\n\n### Errors When Connecting Entities\n- Ensure that all necessary connections are made between entities, such as pipes between the offshore pump and the boiler, and between the boiler and the steam engine. Verify that the entities are correctly aligned and that you have the necessary items in your inventory.\n\n### Errors Due to Unpowered Entities\n- Ensure that all entities requiring power are connected to the electric network. Place electric poles strategically to cover all necessary entities.\n\n### Errors Due to No Fuel in Furnaces or Boilers\n- Regularly check and refill fuel in furnaces and boilers to maintain continuous operation."}
