Misalignment can cause errors such as \"Could not connect transport-belt\" and \"attempt to index field ? (a nil value)\".\n\n### Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Verify that the source items are available for inserters to pick up. This can be caused by incorrect belt connections or lack of materials on the belts.\n\n### Errors with BeltGroup Attributes\n- Ensure that the BeltGroup objects are correctly defined and have all necessary attributes before attempting operations on them. Missing attributes like 'tile_dimensions' can cause errors.\n\n### Furnace Warnings: No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Make sure that the furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. This can be resolved by ensuring proper supply of raw materials through belts or inserters."}
