{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at position(-15.0, y=-49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position(-15.0, y=-49.0) used for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Coal Mining and Transport System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position(42.0, y=-83.0) for mining coal. It is currently working but has an output blockage due to lack of a sink entity.\n- Burner Inserter at position(42.5, y=-81.5) used to transfer items from the mining drill to the transport system. It is currently waiting for source items and has a warning that the chest is full.\n- BeltGroup consisting of transport belts connecting the mining drill and inserter, running from position(42.5, y=-82.5) to position(44.5, y=-82.5) and from position(43.5, y=-81.5) to position(43.5, y=-79.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing Wooden Chest\n- Ensure that the intended position for placing a Wooden Chest is not already occupied by another entity or obstruction. Clear any obstructions before attempting to place the chest.\n\n### Errors when extending or reconnecting transport belts\n- Confirm that the intended position for extending or reconnecting a transport belt is clear and available. Ensure that the belt path is continuous and not blocked by other entities.\n\n### Errors due to output blockage in mining drills\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity, such as a chest or another transport mechanism, connected to the output of the mining drill to prevent blockage.\n\n### Errors due to lack of fuel in furnaces\n- Regularly check and refuel furnaces to ensure continuous operation. Ensure that the fuel inventory is not empty to avoid production halts."}
