{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15, -50) to (-9, -48)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5) storing iron ore.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-13.0, -48.0), (-11.0, -48.0), and (-9.0, -48.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-14.5, -46.5) waiting for source items to transfer from chest to furnace.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (41, -82) to (43, -80)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (41.0, -82.0) extracting coal.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (41.5, -80.5) storing coal.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (43.0, -82.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (43.5, -80.5) waiting for source items to transfer from chest to furnace.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities due to collision\n- Ensure there is enough space for placing entities. Consider increasing the spacing, changing the direction, or altering the reference position to avoid collisions with existing entities.\n\n### Errors due to inserters waiting for source items\n- Ensure that the source items are available for inserters to function. Regularly check the supply chain to prevent bottlenecks.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient inventory for furnaces\n- Maintain a sufficient supply of raw materials in the inventory to ensure continuous operation of furnaces. Regularly monitor inventory levels and replenish as needed."}
