{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-9.5, 24.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Boiler at position (-5.5, 25.0)\n- Steam Engine at position (-12.5, 24.5)\n- Pipes connecting these entities at various positions to facilitate fluid flow:\n  - Pipe at x=-9.0 y=26.0\n  - Pipe at x=-6.5 y=25.0\n  - Pipe at x=-5.5 y=25.0\n  - Pipe at x=-7.5 y=23.5\n  - Pipe at x=-12.5 y=23.5\n- Electric Pole at position (-13.5, 24.5) to connect the steam engine to the power network.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (15.0, 0.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Inserter at position (16.5, 0.5) to move items into the furnace.\n- Inserter at position (17.5, 0.5) to move items from a wooden chest at position (18.5, 0.5) into the furnace.\n- Small Electric Pole at position (17.5, -0.5) to provide power to the inserters.\n- Wooden Chest at position (5.5, 0.5) for storage.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Connecting Power Network\n- Ensure that all entities requiring power are connected to the power network. Place electric poles strategically to cover all entities that need electricity.\n\n### Errors in Fluid Connections\n- Verify that all fluid connections are complete and that there are no missing pipes. Ensure that the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine are properly connected with pipes to allow fluid flow.\n\n### Errors in Inserter Power Supply\n- Make sure inserters are receiving power by connecting them to the power network with electric poles. Check the placement of electric poles to ensure they are within range of the inserters.\n\n### Errors in Steam Engine and Boiler Connections\n- Ensure that the steam engine and boiler are connected to the power network and that they have a proper input of liquid. Check for any missing pipes or incorrect connections that might prevent fluid flow.\n\n### General Placement Errors\n- Before placing entities, confirm that the target tile is unoccupied and suitable for the intended entity."}
