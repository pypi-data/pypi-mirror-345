{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron plate mine at position (16.0, 71.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (16.0, 71.0) facing down, extracting iron ore\n- Stone furnace at position (16.0, 73.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates\n- Wooden chest at position (17.5, 73.5) collecting iron plates from the furnace\n- Burner inserter at position (18.5, 73.5) moving iron plates from the furnace to the chest\n\nThis structure forms a compact iron ore mining and smelting setup where raw iron ore is mined, smelted into iron plates, and stored for further use.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors placing inserters next to other entities\n- When placing burner inserters adjacent to furnaces or chests, ensure there is enough spacing and the target tile is free. If placement fails due to an occupied tile, try increasing spacing, changing the direction, or adjusting the reference position.\n- Avoid placing inserters on tiles already occupied by chests or furnaces.\n\n### Inventory and resource management errors\n- Running out of burner inserters and coal in inventory prevents placing and fueling inserters and drills. Keep track of inventory counts and craft or gather resources proactively.\n- Crafting burner inserters failed due to missing iron plates. Ensure iron plates are available by maintaining continuous smelting and proper inserter operation.\n\n### Variable usage and code errors\n- The variable `extracted_ore` was used before definition, causing a NameError. Always initialize and define variables before use.\n- Check for correct variable names and scope to avoid runtime exceptions.\n\n### Extraction errors from drill drop position\n- Extraction attempts failed because no valid iron ore entity was found at the drill\u2019s drop position. Confirm the drill is properly positioned over an ore patch and that the drop position is correct.\n- Ensure the output of drills is connected to a valid sink entity (e.g., furnace or chest) to avoid output blockage warnings.\n\n### Inserter output blocked warnings\n- Inserters report \"output blocked by item on the ground\" and \"no sink entity in place to accept the output.\" This indicates the inserter\u2019s drop position is not connected to a valid inventory or chest.\n- Connect inserter output positions to chests or belts to avoid blocking and ensure smooth item transfer.\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nNo user-defined functions have been defined in the agent\u2019s execution logs so far."}
