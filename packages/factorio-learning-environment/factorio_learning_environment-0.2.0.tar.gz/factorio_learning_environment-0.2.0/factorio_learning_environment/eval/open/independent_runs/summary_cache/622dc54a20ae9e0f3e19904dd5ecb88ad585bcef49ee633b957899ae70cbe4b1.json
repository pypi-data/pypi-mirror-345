{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-0.5, -9.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Boiler (position -4.5, 23.0)\n- Steam engine (position -0.5, -9.5)\n- Offshore pump (position -10.5, 25.5)\n- Small electric poles (multiple positions, including -11.5, 26.5)\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 0, 0) and a furnace at position(0, 0)\n- Burner mining drill (position 5, 5) and a furnace at position(5, 5)\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine at position(z1) and inserter at position(a) that puts into assembling machine\n- Beltgroup (position) that connects the furnace at position y1 to assembling machine at position(z1)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting pipes\n- Ensure there are no obstructions in the path when attempting to connect pipes. Check for any entities that may block the connection.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors related to power connections\n- Verify that all entities requiring power are properly connected to the electricity network. Check the status of electric poles and ensure they are within range of the entities needing power."}
