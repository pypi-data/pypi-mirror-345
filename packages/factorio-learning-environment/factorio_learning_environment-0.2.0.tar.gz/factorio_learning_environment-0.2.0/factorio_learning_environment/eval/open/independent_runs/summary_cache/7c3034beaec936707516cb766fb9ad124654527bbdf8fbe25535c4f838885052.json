{"content": "## Report\n\n### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Coal Mining and Distribution Setup\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (41.0, -82.0)\n  - Connected to multiple **Wooden Chests** at positions (40.5, -83.5), (42.5, -83.5), (43.5, -83.5), and (44.5, -83.5) for coal storage.\n  - **Burner Inserter** at position (41.5, -83.5) facilitates coal transfer between entities.\n\n#### Iron Plate Smelting Facility\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (64.0, -53.0)\n  - Fueled by coal, but currently lacks ingredients to smelt.\n  - **Wooden Chest** at position (61.5, -52.5) stores miscellaneous items including coal.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors with Belt Connections\n- **Issue**: Attempted to connect belts directly from a `Prototype.WoodenChest` object.\n  - **Solution**: Use an inserter to transfer items from a wooden chest to a belt.\n\n#### Errors with Inserter Placement\n- **Issue**: Failed to place a burner-inserter due to collision or unsuitable terrain.\n  - **Solution**: Check for existing entities at the target position and ensure sufficient spacing. Consider changing the direction or reference position for placement.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n#### Utility Functions\n- **connect_entities**: Used to connect entities with belts. Failed when attempting to connect directly from a wooden chest.\n- **place_entity_next_to**: Used for placing entities adjacent to others. Encountered placement errors due to collisions or unsuitable terrain.\n\n#### Important Variables\n- `belt_line`: Represents the line of belts being connected.\n- `inserter`: Represents the inserter entity being placed.\n- `chest_1.position`: Reference position for placing entities next to a wooden chest."}
