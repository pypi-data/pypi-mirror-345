{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Smelting Area\nConsists of 4 stone furnaces:\n- Furnace at (0.0, 0.0)\n- Furnace at (2.0, 0.0) \n- Furnace at (4.0, 4.0)\n- Furnace at (6.0, 4.0)\nAll furnaces are currently idle with no ingredients but have coal fuel loaded.\n\n### Power Generation System at (-2.5, 24.0)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Boiler at (-2.5, 24.0)\n- Steam engine at (4.5, 24.5)\n- Connected pipe network between components\n- Small electric poles for power distribution\nSystem is operational with water flowing but boiler currently needs fuel.\n\n### Research Lab at (10.5, 0.5)\n- Single lab building\n- Connected to power network\n- Contains 2 automation science packs\n- Currently working on automation research\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inventory Management Errors\n- Ensure required materials are in inventory before attempting crafting operations\n- Check if raw materials need to be gathered or smelted before attempting to craft items that require processed materials\n\n### Recipe Requirements Errors\n- Some items like copper plates and iron plates must be smelted in furnaces, they cannot be directly crafted\n- Raw resources like wood must be gathered from the environment, they cannot be crafted\n\n### Entity Placement Errors\n- Verify you have the required entity in inventory before attempting placement\n- Ensure proper positioning and spacing when placing buildings\n\n### Programming/API Errors\n- Cannot perform arithmetic operations directly on entity prototype attributes\n- Use proper attribute access methods for entity dimensions and properties\n\n### Connection Errors\n- Ensure you have required connection items (like pipes) in inventory before attempting to connect entities\n- Verify entities are within connection range of each other\n\n### Power System Errors\n- Ensure all components of power system are properly connected\n- Maintain fuel supply in boilers to keep power generation active"}
