{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (-1.5, 24.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting these components, with various pipes at positions such as (-8.5, 23.5), (-6.5, 22.5), etc.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0)\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) connected to a Small Electric Pole at Position (5.5, -60.5)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5) and another at Position (6.5, -59.5)\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at various positions such as (5.5, -60.5), (7.5, -60.5), etc.\n\n### Research Lab\nConsists of:\n- Lab at Position (not specified) with status NO_POWER\n- Connected to the same ElectricityGroup as the Iron Plate Production Facility\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Pipe Connections\n- Ensure that pipes are placed correctly and are not blocked by other entities. Verify the connection paths between the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine to ensure proper alignment and connectivity.\n\n### Errors in Crafting Small Electric Poles\n- Ensure that all required sub-ingredients for crafting, such as copper cables and copper plates, are available. Copper plates require smelting in a furnace, so ensure a functioning furnace setup for copper plate production.\n\n### Errors in Power Connectivity\n- Verify that all components requiring electricity are connected to a functioning power network. Ensure that there are no missing connections or insufficient power supply to entities like inserters and labs.\n\n### Errors in Electrical Network Setup\n- Ensure that all power poles are connected correctly and that the network is complete. Check for missing poles or incorrect placements that could disrupt the power flow."}
