{"content": "# FACTORIO REPORT\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System (x=-9.5, y=1.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump (x=-9.5, y=1.5)\n- Boiler (x=-5.5, y=4.0) with 45 coal\n- Steam engine (x=-0.5, y=7.5)\n- Pipe network connecting these components\n- Small electric pole (x=1.5, y=7.5)\n\nThe system is currently working and producing power for the factory, generating approximately 29 steam per minute.\n\n### Iron Mining and Smelting Setup (x=18.5, y=73.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill (x=18.5, y=73.5) mining iron ore\n- Stone furnace (x=19.0, y=77.0) with 20 coal\n- Inserter (x=18.5, y=75.5) moving ore from drill to furnace\n- Output inserter (x=19.5, y=78.5) moving iron plates from furnace to chest\n- Wooden chest (x=19.5, y=79.5) for iron plate storage\n- Chest output inserter (x=19.5, y=80.5) to extract plates from chest\n- Transport belt system starting at (x=19.5, y=81.5)\n- Small electric poles (x=21.5, y=73.5), (x=20.5, y=75.5), (x=21.5, y=78.5), (x=21.5, y=80.5)\n\n### Copper Mining and Smelting Setup (x=-48.5, y=78.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill (x=-48.5, y=78.5) mining copper ore\n- Stone furnace (x=-48.0, y=82.0) with 20 coal\n- Inserter (x=-48.5, y=80.5) moving ore from drill to furnace\n- Output inserter (x=-47.5, y=83.5) moving copper plates from furnace to chest\n- Wooden chest (x=-47.5, y=84.5) for copper plate storage\n- Chest output inserter (x=-47.5, y=85.5) to extract plates from chest\n- Small electric poles (x=-45.5, y=78.5), (x=-46.5, y=80.5), (x=-45.5, y=83.5), (x=-45.5, y=85.5)\n\n### Copper Cable Assembly (x=-6.5, y=74.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine 2 (x=-6.5, y=74.5) set to produce copper cables\n- Input inserter (x=-8.5, y=74.5) for copper plates\n- Output inserter (x=-4.5, y=74.5) for copper cables\n- Small electric poles (x=-6.5, y=71.5), (x=-6.5, y=76.5)\n\n### Electronic Circuit Assembly (x=7.5, y=78.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine 2 (x=7.5, y=78.5) set to produce electronic circuits\n- Input inserter for iron plates (x=7.5, y=76.5)\n- Input inserter for copper cables (x=5.5, y=78.5)\n- Output inserter (x=7.5, y=80.5) moving circuits to chest\n- Wooden chest (x=7.5, y=81.5) for electronic circuit storage\n- Small electric poles (x=7.5, y=75.5), (x=5.5, y=76.5), (x=9.5, y=80.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting entities with transport belts\n- Transport belts cannot be connected directly from a chest as a source. You need to add an inserter that takes items from the chest and use the inserter as a source entity.\n- When connecting entities with transport belts, ensure the path is clear and there are no obstacles or other entities blocking the way.\n\n### Errors with entity placement and positioning\n- Cannot connect to target inserter pickup position if it's"}
