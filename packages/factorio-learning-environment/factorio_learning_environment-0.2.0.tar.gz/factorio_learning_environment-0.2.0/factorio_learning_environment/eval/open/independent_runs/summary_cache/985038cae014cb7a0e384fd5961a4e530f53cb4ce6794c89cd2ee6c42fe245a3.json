{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with a fuel inventory of coal and a warning status indicating \"no ingredients to smelt\" and \"furnace fuel source is full\". The furnace has produced 21 iron plates.\n\n### Pipe Network at Position (x=-12.5, y=21.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- PipeGroup with fluid system ID 9819, starting at position (x=-12.5, y=21.5) and extending through positions (x=-11.5, y=21.5), (x=-11.5, y=22.5), (x=-10.5, y=22.5), (x=-10.5, y=23.5), and (x=-9.5, y=23.5). The status of the pipe network is EMPTY.\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of the following entities:\n- ElectricityGroup with ID 53267, including poles at positions (x=-7.5, y=19.5), (x=-7.5, y=18.5), (x=-3.5, y=18.5), and extending to other positions up to (x=1.5, y=20.5) and (x=-8.5, y=22.5), (x=-3.5, y=22.5). The network voltage is 0.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Finding Suitable Positions for Offshore Pump\n- Ensure the selected position for placing an offshore pump is adjacent to a water source and is not obstructed by other entities or terrain features.\n\n### Errors when Placing Boiler\n- Verify that the position for placing a boiler is suitable and not occupied by other entities or unsuitable terrain. Consider checking the terrain and surrounding entities before attempting placement.\n\n### Errors with 'Position' Object\n- Ensure that the 'Position' object is used correctly and is not mistakenly called as a function. Double-check the syntax and usage of the 'Position' object in the code."}
