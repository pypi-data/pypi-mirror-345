{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Complex at (-28, -61)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-28.0, -61.0) connected to transport belt and wooden chest\n- Stone furnace at (-27.0, -58.0)\n- Wooden chest at (-27.5, -59.5) storing iron and copper ore\n- Burner inserter network to move materials between components\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Complex at (-10, -59)\nConsists of:\n- Three burner mining drills at (-10.0, -59.0), (-8.0, -59.0), (-6.0, -59.0)\n- Multiple wooden chests and burner inserters for ore storage and transport\n- Transport belt system connecting components\n\n### Smelting Line at (0, 0)\nConsists of:\n- Four stone furnaces at (0.0, 0.0), (2.0, 0.0), (4.0, 0.0), (6.0, 0.0)\n- Network of burner inserters and wooden chests for input/output\n- Transport belt system for material movement\n\n### Power Generation Setup\n- Offshore pump placed at (-3.5, 27.5) for water intake\n\n### Research Facility\n- Lab present (position not specified) configured for automation science pack research\n\n### Transport Infrastructure\nMultiple belt groups connecting various production areas:\n- Belt system from (-29.5, -60.5) to (-29.5, -56.5)\n- Extended belt network from (-4.5, -57.5) to (0.5, -2.5)\n- Belt system from (-9.5, -54.5) to (-7.5, -54.5)\n- Belt system from (-6.5, -54.5) to (-4.5, -54.5)\n- Belt system from (-0.5, 4.5) to (6.5, 5.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Power Connection Issues\n- Ensure power generating structures are properly connected to consumers\n- Lab requires power connection to function\n\n### Entity Placement Issues\n- Cannot place boiler without having it in inventory first\n- Ensure required items are crafted before attempting placement\n\n### Transport System Blockages\n- Clear blocked transport belts at (2.5, 4.5), (4.5, 4.5), and (6.5, 4.5)\n- Monitor belt capacity to prevent backup\n\n### Resource Management\n- Empty full chests to prevent mining stoppage (chest at -9.5, -57.5 is full)\n- Keep burner inserters fueled (burner inserter at -5.5, -56.5 needs fuel)\n\n### Fluid System Issues\n- Ensure offshore pump is properly connected to water consumers\n- Check fluid connections when setting up water-based systems"}
