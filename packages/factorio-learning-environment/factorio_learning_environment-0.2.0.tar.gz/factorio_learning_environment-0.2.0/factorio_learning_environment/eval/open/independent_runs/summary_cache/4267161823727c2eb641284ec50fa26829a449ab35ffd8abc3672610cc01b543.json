{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) with a warning indicating the chest at the drop position is full. It is connected to a transport belt at position (39.5, -83.5) and a wooden chest at position (40.5, -83.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (40.5, -83.5) containing coal.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with a warning for no ingredients to smelt.\n- Burner Inserter at position (1.5, 0.5) transferring items from the furnace to a wooden chest at position (2.5, 0.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (2.5, 0.5).\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (10.0, 0.0) with a warning for no ingredients to smelt.\n- Burner Inserter at position (11.5, 0.5) transferring items from the furnace to a wooden chest at position (12.5, 0.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (12.5, 0.5) containing copper plates.\n\n### Transport and Storage System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Inserter at position (3.5, 0.5) transferring items from a wooden chest at position (2.5, 0.5) to a transport belt at position (4.5, 0.5).\n- Transport Belt group connecting positions (3.5, 0.5) to (5.5, 0.5) and (4.5, 0.5) to (6.5, 0.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors when interacting with non-existent entities\n- Verify the existence of an entity at a specified position before attempting to interact with it. For example, attempting to insert items into a non-existent wooden chest at position (42.0, -83.0) resulted in an error."}
