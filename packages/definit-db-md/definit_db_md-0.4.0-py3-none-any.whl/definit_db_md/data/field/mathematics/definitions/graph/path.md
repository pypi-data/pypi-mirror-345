# path

A path in a [graph](/data_md/mathematics/definitions/graph/graph.md) is a [finite](/data_md/mathematics/definitions/foundamental/finite_set.md) or infinite sequence of [edges](/data_md/mathematics/definitions/graph/edge.md) which joins a sequence of [nodes](/data_md/mathematics/definitions/graph/node.md) which, by most definitions, are all distinct (and since the nodes are distinct, so are the edges).
