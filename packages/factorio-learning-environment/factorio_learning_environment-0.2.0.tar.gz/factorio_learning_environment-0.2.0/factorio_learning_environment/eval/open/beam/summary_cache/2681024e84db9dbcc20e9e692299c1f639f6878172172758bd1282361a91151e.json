{"content": "The error indicates that the player is too far from the target position to place the small electric pole. Let's ensure the player moves closer to the target position before attempting to place the pole.\n\nHere's how to address this:\n\n1. **Move Closer to the Target Position**: Ensure the player is within the allowable distance to place the entity.\n2. **Place the Small Electric Pole**: Once close enough, place the pole.\n\nLet's implement these steps:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Move closer to the target position for placing the electric pole\npole_position = Position(x=4.0, y=0.0)\nmove_to(pole_position)\n\n# Step 2: Place the Small Electric Pole near the Assembling Machine\npole_entity = place_entity(Prototype.SmallElectricPole, position=pole_position, direction=Direction.UP)\n\n# Step 3: Connect the Electric Pole to the Assembling Machine\nconnect_entities(pole_entity, assembling_machine)\n\n# Insert necessary items into the assembling machine\ninsert_item(Prototype.CopperPlate, assembling_machine, quantity=5)\nset_entity_recipe(assembling_machine, Prototype.CopperCable)\n\n# Wait for the machine to produce the cables\nsleep(5)\n\n# Step 4: Validate and Confirm Production\ninventory_after = inspect_inventory()\nassert inventory_after.get(Prototype.CopperCable, 0) > 0, \"Copper Cable production was not successful.\"\n\n# Output the final inventory and entity states\nprint(f\"Refined Inventory: {inventory_after}\")\nprint(f\"Entity Configurations: {get_entities()}\")\n```\n\nThis code ensures that the player moves within the maximum allowable distance to place the small electric pole, thus preventing the \"too far away\" error.", "summary_range": "[1-92]"}
