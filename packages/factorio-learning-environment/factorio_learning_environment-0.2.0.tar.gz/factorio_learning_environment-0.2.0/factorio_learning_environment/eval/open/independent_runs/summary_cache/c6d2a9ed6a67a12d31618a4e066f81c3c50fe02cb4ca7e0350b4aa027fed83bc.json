{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone furnace at position(-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace (position -15.0, -50.0) which is currently processing iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Burner mining drill at position(41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (position 41.0, -82.0) which has been refueled and is actively mining resources.\n- Wooden chest (position 41.5, -80.5) which is currently full and needs to be emptied to continue mining.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(x)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (position x1) and a furnace at position(y1)\n- Burner mining drill (position x2) and a furnace at position(y2)\n- Burner mining drill (position x3) and a furnace at position(y3)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n- **Errors when inserting into the stone furnace without iron ore**\n  - Ensure you have iron ore in your inventory before attempting to insert it into the stone furnace. Check inventory before each insertion attempt.\n\n- **Errors when refueling the burner mining drill**\n  - Regularly check the status of the burner mining drill and ensure it has enough fuel. If the drill is not working, verify if the drop position chest is full and empty it if necessary.\n\n- **Errors when the wooden chest is full**\n  - Monitor the inventory of the wooden chest at position (41.5, -80.5) and empty it to allow the burner mining drill to continue its operation.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - `insert_into_furnace(entity, item)`: Used to insert items into the furnace. Failure occurs if the item is not in inventory.\n  - `refuel_entity(entity)`: Used to refuel the burner mining drill. Success if enough fuel is available.\n  \n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `iron_ore: int` - Number of iron ore in inventory.\n  - `coal: int` - Amount of coal available for fueling.\n  - `wooden_chest: object` - Reference to the wooden chest entity.\n  - `burner_mining_drill: object` - Reference to the burner mining drill entity."}
