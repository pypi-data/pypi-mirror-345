{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-29.5, 30.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position -29.5, 30.5), boiler (position -34.5, 30.0), and offshore pump (position -10.5, 25.5). The generator is intended to produce electricity through steam generated from the boiler.\n\n### Pipe network\nConsists of multiple pipe groups, including:\n- PipeGroup (fluid_system=60902, position=-24.5, -51.5)\n- PipeGroup (fluid_system=60903, fluid=water, position=-11.5, 24.5)\n- PipeGroup (fluid_system=60904, position=-2.5, 24.5)\n- PipeGroup (fluid_system=61060, position=-24.5, -51.5)\n- PipeGroup (fluid_system=61062, fluid=water, position=-12.5, 24.5)\n\n### Labs\nConsists of two labs (positions not specified) that are currently not connected to power.\n\n### Furnaces\nConsists of two furnaces:\n- Furnace (position 5.0, -73.0)\n- Furnace (position -18.0, -49.0)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing or connecting pipes\n- Ensure that the location where you are trying to place a pipe does not overlap with water or any other entity. Check the coordinates carefully before placing.\n\n### Errors with boiler connection\n- The boiler is currently not connected. Make sure to connect it to a valid water source and ensure that the pipes are correctly placed to avoid overlapping issues.\n\n### Errors with electricity connection\n- The steam engine is not connected to a power network. Verify the connections of small electric poles to ensure they are correctly placed to provide power.\n\n### Errors with lab power\n- The labs are currently showing no power. Ensure that they are connected to the electricity grid and that there are sufficient power sources available.\n\n### General placement errors\n- Always verify that the tile you are attempting to place an entity on is free and not occupied by another entity.\n\n### Errors with pipe placement\n- Avoid placing pipes in locations where existing objects are present. Always check for suitable positions before attempting to place a pipe."}
