{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Steam Engine** at position (x=17.5, y=20.5), currently not connected due to no input liquid and no fluid present in connections.\n- **Boiler** at position (x=1.5, y=23.0), out of fuel, connected to a series of pipes.\n- **Offshore Pump** at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5), working status, supplying water through a connected pipe network.\n- **Pipe Network**:\n  - PipeGroup at position (x=3.5, y=17.5), status: empty, connects various positions.\n  - PipeGroup at position (x=-9.5, y=23.5), status: full output, carrying water, connects various positions.\n- **Electricity Group** with poles at various positions, currently not generating voltage.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Steam Engine Connection\n- Ensure that the steam engine is properly connected to a fluid source. Check the pipe connections and ensure that there is a continuous path for the fluid to reach the engine.\n\n### Boiler Out of Fuel\n- Regularly check the fuel levels in the boiler and ensure it is refueled to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Offshore Pump Connection\n- Verify that the offshore pump is correctly connected to the pipe network to ensure a steady supply of water to the boiler.\n\n### General Placement Errors\n- Before placing any entity, ensure that the target tile is unoccupied and suitable for the intended entity to avoid placement errors."}
