{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n###Iron Plate Production Line at y=0.0\nConsists of four stone furnaces in a row with complete automation:\n- Furnace at x=0.0 (contains 21 coal, 2 iron ore, 33 iron plates)\n  - Has burner inserter at x=-1.5 y=0.5 for coal input from wooden chest at x=-2.5 y=0.5 (20 coal)\n  - Has burner inserter at x=0.5 y=-1.5 for ore input from wooden chest at x=0.5 y=-2.5 (4 iron ore)\n- Furnace at x=2.0 (contains 21 coal, 2 iron ore, 32 iron plates)\n  - Has burner inserter at x=2.5 y=-1.5 for ore input from wooden chest at x=2.5 y=-2.5 (20 coal, 4 iron ore)\n  - Has output wooden chest at x=2.5 y=1.5 (empty)\n  - Has output burner inserter at x=1.5 y=1.5 to move plates to the chest\n- Furnace at x=4.0 (contains 22 coal, 2 iron ore, 18 iron plates)\n  - Has input chest at x=4.5 y=-2.5 (20 coal, 4 iron ore)\n  - Has input burner inserter at x=4.5 y=-1.5\n  - Has output wooden chest at x=4.5 y=1.5 (empty)\n  - Has output burner inserter at x=3.5 y=1.5\n- Furnace at x=6.0 (contains 22 coal, 1 iron ore, 18 iron plates)\n  - Has input chest at x=6.5 y=-2.5 (20 coal, 4 iron ore)\n  - Has input burner inserter at x=6.5 y=-1.5\n  - Has output wooden chest at x=6.5 y=1.5 (empty)\n  - Has output burner inserter at x=5.5 y=1.5\n\nERROR TIPS\n### Entity placement collision errors\n- When placing inserters next to furnaces, account for the furnace's 2x2 tile size\n- Use appropriate spacing parameter when placing entities next to large structures\n- Check entity dimensions before attempting to place adjacent entities\n- When placing chests near furnaces, ensure there is enough space between existing structures\n- Consider alternative directions when initial placement fails due to entity collisions\n\n### Resource management errors\n- Check inventory before attempting to insert items into chests or entities\n- Keep track of consumed resources to ensure enough materials remain for planned construction\n- Consider harvesting more resources when running low before attempting insertions\n- Verify you have required items in inventory before attempting to place or insert\n\n### Inserter blocked output errors\n- Multiple inserters show \"output blocked by item on ground\" - ensure proper output paths are clear\n- Configure inserter drop positions to valid input slots on destination entities\n- Set up proper output collection systems before activating input automation\n- Verify inserter chains have valid end destinations before activation\n\n### Automation efficiency\n- When setting up automated systems, ensure both input and output flows are properly configured\n- Test automation with small quantities before scaling up production\n- Monitor inserter status messages to identify bottlenecks in the production line\n- Balance input and output rates to prevent backup or resource starvation\n\n### Furnace operation\n- Maintain balanced fuel and ore supplies to all furnaces\n- Monitor furnace warnings and status messages to identify operation issues\n- Ensure proper resource distribution across all furnaces in the production line\n- Set up complete input-output chains before starting furnace operations"}
