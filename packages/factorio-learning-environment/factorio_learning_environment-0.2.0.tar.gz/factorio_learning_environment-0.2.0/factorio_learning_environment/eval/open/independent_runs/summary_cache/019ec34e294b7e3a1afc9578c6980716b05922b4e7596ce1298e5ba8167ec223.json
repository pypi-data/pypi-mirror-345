Ensure the agent is within reach of the stone resource before attempting to harvest it. Check the radius argument of the harvest_resource function.\n- The agent has burner mining drills and burner inserters that are out of fuel. Ensure that these entities are supplied with fuel (coal) to function correctly.\n\nNAMESPACE\n- harvest_resource(stone_pos, quantity, radius):\n  - Failure: \"Could not harvest. Nothing within reach to harvest,\" - The specified position does not have a harvestable resource within the given radius.\n```"}
