If an error occurs, consider adjusting the placement position or removing the obstructing entity.\n\n### Errors when placing inserters with incorrect spacing or direction\n- Verify the spacing and direction when placing inserters. Adjust the reference position, spacing, or direction to avoid conflicts with existing entities like small electric poles.\n\n### Errors due to lack of fuel or ingredients\n- Regularly check and refuel entities like boilers and burner mining drills. Ensure furnaces and assembling machines have the necessary ingredients to operate.\n\n### Errors due to missing electricity\n- Ensure that all electrical entities are connected to a power source. Check the electricity network for any disconnections or insufficient power supply."}
