{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) with a drop position at (52.5, -84.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5) containing coal and copper ore\n- Wooden Chest at position (54.5, -84.5) containing coal\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Storage at Position (-23.0, -68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) with a drop position at (52.5, -84.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (-23.5, -69.5) containing copper ore\n- Wooden Chest at position (-24.5, -67.5) containing iron ore\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) with a drop position at (-14.5, -54.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -54.5) containing iron ore\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5) with pickup and drop positions\n- Wooden Chest at position (-12.5, -54.5) containing iron ore and copper plate\n\n### Copper Ore Processing at Position (0.0, 0.0) and (5.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n- Stone Furnace at position (5.0, 0.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n- Multiple Wooden Chests around these furnaces containing copper ore\n\n### Transport Belt System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (1.5, 1.5) to (3.5, 1.5) and (2.5, 1.5) to (4.5, 1.5)\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (3.5, 2.5) to (5.5, 2.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using pickup_entity with incorrect object type\n- Ensure that the entity you are trying to pick up is a valid and callable entity type, not a 'Chest' object. Use the correct method or function to interact with the entity.\n\n### Errors related to full chests\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are full to prevent mining drills from halting operations due to lack of space in destination chests.\n\n### Errors when inserters are waiting for source items\n- Ensure that the source items are available for inserters to pick up. Check the supply chain to ensure that items are being delivered to the inserter's pickup position."}
