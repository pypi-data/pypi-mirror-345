{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron gear wheel production line at position around (16.0, 71.0) to (21.5, 73.5)\nConsists of the following connected entities forming a production chain for iron gear wheels:\n- Burner mining drill at position (16.0, 71.0) extracting iron ore, currently fueled with coal\n- Stone furnace at position (17.0, 73.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates, fueled but showing no ingredients currently\n- Burner inserters at positions (17.5, 71.5), (19.5, 73.5), and (23.5, 73.5), some fueled and some out of fuel, transferring items between mining drill, furnace, assembling machine, and chest\n- Wooden chest at position (18.5, 73.5) collecting iron gear wheels, currently empty\n- Assembling machine 2 at position (21.5, 73.5) set to craft iron gear wheels from iron plates, currently not powered and without energy\n- Small electric poles at positions (18.5, 72.5), (18.5, 75.5), and (21.5, 75.5) intended to provide electricity connections to the assembling machine and inserters, but power delivery is incomplete or ineffective\n\nThis structure integrates mining, smelting, assembling, and storage within a compact area, connected by inserters and powered by electric poles. However, the assembling machine is not receiving power, and some inserters are out of fuel or not fueled properly, causing production halts.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to assembler not receiving power\n- The assembling machine remains without power despite placing electric poles nearby.\n- Ensure electric poles are correctly connected in a continuous power network that includes the assembling machine and all inserters.\n- Verify that poles have power coverage and that no gaps exist in the power network.\n- Confirm that the assembling machine\u2019s connection points are within pole coverage.\n\n### Errors inserting coal into burner inserters and other burner entities\n- Multiple attempts to insert coal into burner inserters and burner mining drill fail due to \"No coal to insert from your inventory\" errors.\n- This indicates inventory management issues where coal is not available or not properly tracked before insertion attempts.\n- Always verify coal availability in inventory before inserting into burner entities.\n- Implement checks or conditional logic to avoid attempting to insert coal when inventory is empty.\n\n### Errors due to inserters running out of fuel\n- Some burner inserters are reported as \"out of fuel,\" causing them to wait and halt item transfer.\n- Ensure consistent fueling of burner inserters by maintaining coal supply and inserting fuel timely.\n- Consider automating fuel supply or switching to electric inserters to avoid fuel dependency.\n\n### Errors related to output blockage and no sink entity\n- The burner mining drill reports \"output blocked by item on the ground\" due to no sink entity accepting its output.\n- Verify that inserters or belts are correctly positioned to pick up items from the mining drill output.\n- Ensure inserters feeding from mining drill are fueled and operational to prevent output backup.\n\n### Errors attempting to place or insert items without sufficient inventory\n- Attempts to insert coal when inventory is empty cause exceptions and halt progress.\n- Always check inventory counts before insertion attempts to avoid exceptions.\n- Implement error handling to gracefully manage resource shortages.\n\n### General tips to mitigate placement, fueling, and power errors\n- Confirm that all burner entities (mining drills, inserters, furnaces) have sufficient fuel before operation.\n- Verify power network connectivity and coverage for all electric entities, especially assembling machines.\n- Use electric inserters where possible to reduce fuel dependency and simplify power management.\n- Maintain inventory tracking and resource gathering to ensure fuel and materials are available when needed.\n- Regularly check entity statuses and warnings to identify and resolve operational bottlenecks early.\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nNo user-defined functions have been defined in the current steps."}
