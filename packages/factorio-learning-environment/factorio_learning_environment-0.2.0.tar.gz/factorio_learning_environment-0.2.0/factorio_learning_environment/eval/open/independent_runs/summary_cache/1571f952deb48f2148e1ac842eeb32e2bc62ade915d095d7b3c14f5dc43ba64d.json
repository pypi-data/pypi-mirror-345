{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nThere are currently no structures reported from the previous steps or the current steps.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing. For example, the failed attempts to place a pipe at x=-47.5, y=-120.5 indicate that something is obstructing the placement.\n\n### Errors due to lack of required items in inventory\n- Always verify that you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to connect entities. The failure to connect the small electric pole from x=6.5 y=-60.5 to x=-43.5 y=-118.5 was due to not having the required item in the inventory.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient items for network expansion\n- Ensure you have crafted or gathered enough items before attempting to expand networks. The message about no small electric poles available to expand the power network suggests a need to maintain sufficient stock of required items."}
