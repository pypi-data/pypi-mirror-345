{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(2.5, -18.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position 2.5, -18.5), boiler (position 2.5, -17.5) and offshore pump (position 2.5, -16.5)\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(0, 0)\nConsists of following entities\n- Burner mining drill (position 0, 0) and a furnace at position(1, 0)\n- Burner mining drill (position 0, 1) and a furnace at position(1, 1)\n- Burner mining drill (position 0, 2) and a furnace at position(1, 2)\n\n### Copper cable factory at position(1, 0)\nConsists of following entities\n- Burner mining drill (position 0, 0) and a furnace at position(1, 0)\n- Assembling machine at position(2, 0) and inserter at position(2, 1) that puts into assembling machine\n- Beltgroup (position 1) that connects the furnace at position 1, 0 to assembling machine at position(2, 0)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when trying to connect to electric poles\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to connect entities. In this case, you need small electric poles which require wood and copper cables.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
