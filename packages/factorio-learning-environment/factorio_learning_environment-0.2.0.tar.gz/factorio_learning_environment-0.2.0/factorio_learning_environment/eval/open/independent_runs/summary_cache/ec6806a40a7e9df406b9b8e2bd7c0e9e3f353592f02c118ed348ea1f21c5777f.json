{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=4.0, y=-60.0) with 5 coal as fuel, currently working and dropping mined iron ore at position (x=4.5, y=-58.5).\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (x=5.5, y=-60.5), (x=4.5, y=-58.5), and (x=6.5, y=-56.5) for storing iron ore and plates.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (x=-15.0, y=-48.0), (x=-13.0, y=-48.0), and (x=-11.0, y=-48.0) with coal as fuel, currently not smelting due to lack of ingredients and full output.\n- **Burner Inserters** at positions (x=-14.5, y=-46.5), (x=-12.5, y=-46.5), and (x=-10.5, y=-46.5) waiting for source items to transfer to stone furnaces.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage Area\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (x=-16.5, y=-54.5), (x=-17.5, y=-54.5), (x=-14.5, y=-54.5), (x=-15.5, y=-54.5), (x=-13.5, y=-54.5), (x=-14.5, y=-50.5), (x=-11.5, y=-50.5), (x=-9.5, y=-50.5), (x=-8.5, y=-50.5), (x=-7.5, y=-50.5), (x=-6.5, y=-50.5) storing various amounts of iron plates.\n- **Iron Chests** at positions (x=-3.5, y=-52.5), (x=-6.5, y=-50.5), and (x=-5.5, y=-50.5) for additional storage of iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Insufficient Fuel for Drills\n- Ensure to maintain an adequate supply of coal in inventory to refuel drills when necessary.\n\n### Full Chests Preventing Mining\n- Regularly empty chests at drop positions to prevent mining operations from halting due to full storage.\n\n### Furnace Output Full\n- Transfer smelted items from furnaces to storage chests to prevent production halts due to full output inventory.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No specific utility functions were defined or invoked in the provided steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `wooden-chest`: int, count of wooden chests in inventory.\n- `wood`: int, count of wood in inventory.\n- `iron-ore`: int, count of iron ore in inventory.\n- `iron-plate`: int, count of iron plates in inventory.\n- `iron-gear-wheel`: int, count of iron gear wheels in inventory."}
