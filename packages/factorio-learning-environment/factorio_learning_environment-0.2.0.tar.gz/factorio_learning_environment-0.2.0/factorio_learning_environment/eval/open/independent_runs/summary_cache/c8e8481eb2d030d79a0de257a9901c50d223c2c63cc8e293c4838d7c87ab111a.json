{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0): Extracts iron ore and drops it into a chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5): Stores extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates, but currently not receiving iron ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Insufficient Fuel for Inserters and Drills\n- Ensure that all inserters and drills have a sufficient supply of fuel (coal) to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Misalignment of Inserters\n- Verify that inserters are correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items between entities. Ensure that the pickup and drop positions are accurately set.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Iron Ore\n- Check the inserter setup to ensure that the inserter is correctly transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace. Reposition and align the inserter if necessary.\n\n### Full Chest Warning\n- Regularly empty the chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) to prevent mining operations from halting due to a full inventory.\n\n### No Ingredients to Smelt in Furnace\n- Make sure that the furnace receives a steady supply of iron ore to avoid interruptions in smelting operations."}
