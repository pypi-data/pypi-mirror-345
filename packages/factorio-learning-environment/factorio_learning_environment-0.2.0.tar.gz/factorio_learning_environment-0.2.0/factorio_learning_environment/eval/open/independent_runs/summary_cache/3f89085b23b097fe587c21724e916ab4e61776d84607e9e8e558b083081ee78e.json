{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\nCurrently, there are no structures on the map. The agent has attempted to place various entities, but none have been successfully placed.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities on non-buildable tiles\n- Ensure that the target position for placing an entity is buildable. The agent attempted to place entities such as Stone Furnaces and Wooden Chests at positions that were not buildable (e.g., x=21.0 y=21.0, x=25.0 y=25.0, x=0.0 y=0.0, etc.). Verify the buildability of a tile before attempting to place an entity.\n\n### Errors when placing entities without available resources\n- Make sure to have the necessary resources available for the intended placement. The agent encountered errors due to a lack of coal to supply to the Stone Furnace or because the Furnace was not placed. Ensure resources are available and entities are placed correctly to function.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied or restricted\n- Check for any restrictions or occupied tiles before placing entities. The agent tried to place Wooden Chests and Transport Belts in various positions (e.g., x=0.0 y=0.0, x=40.5 y=-82.5, x=45.0 y=-85.0) where placement was not possible. Confirm that the tile is free and not restricted for the intended entity."}
