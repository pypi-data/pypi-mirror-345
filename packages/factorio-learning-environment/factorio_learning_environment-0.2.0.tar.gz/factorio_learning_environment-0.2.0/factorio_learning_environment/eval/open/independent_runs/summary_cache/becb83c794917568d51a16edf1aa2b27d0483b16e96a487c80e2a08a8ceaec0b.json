{"content": "Based on the execution logs, here is the updated report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Smelting Line at position(-23.0, -58.0)\nComplex smelting setup consisting of:\n- Two furnaces at (-23.0, -58.0) and (-21.0, -58.0) processing iron ore\n- Burner inserter at (-20.5, -59.5) moving materials\n- Burner inserter at (-22.5, -56.5) moving finished plates\n- Storage chest at (-22.5, -55.5) collecting iron plates\n- Storage chest at (-24.5, -58.5) storing mixed plates (iron and copper)\n\n### Iron Mining Complex at position(-10.0, -59.0)\nLarge mining setup with:\n- Three burner mining drills at (-10.0, -59.0), (-8.0, -59.0), and (-6.0, -59.0)\n- Multiple storage chests at (-9.5, -57.5), (-7.5, -57.5), (-5.5, -57.5)\n- Network of burner inserters at (-6.5, -57.5), (-5.5, -56.5), (-4.5, -57.5)\n- Transport belt system connecting components\n\n### Iron Smelting Array at position(0.0, 0.0)\nOrganized smelting line with:\n- Four furnaces at (0.0, 0.0), (2.0, 0.0), (4.0, 0.0), (6.0, 0.0)\n- Input storage chests at (0.5, -2.5), (2.5, -2.5), (4.5, -2.5), (6.5, -2.5)\n- Output storage chests at (0.5, 2.5), (2.5, 2.5), (4.5, 2.5), (6.5, 2.5)\n- Multiple burner inserters managing input/output at (-0.5, -2.5), (0.5, -1.5), (2.5, -1.5), (4.5, -1.5), (6.5, -1.5)\n- Additional burner inserters for output at (0.5, 1.5), (2.5, 1.5), (4.5, 1.5), (6.5, 1.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Fuel Management Issues\n- Ensure sufficient coal is available before attempting to insert into furnaces\n- Keep track of fuel levels in burner devices to prevent work stoppage\n\n### Entity Placement and Space Issues\n- Multiple inserters are blocked due to items on ground - ensure proper output paths exist\n- Some furnaces have no ingredients despite having fuel - check input logistics\n\n### Inserter Configuration Issues\n- Several inserters are waiting for source items - verify input supply chains are connected properly\n- Some inserters are waiting for space in destination - ensure output paths are clear and storage is available\n\n### Belt System Warnings\n- Some furnace belts are blocked - ensure proper item flow and clearance in belt systems\n- Mining drill outputs are occasionally blocked - verify belt capacity and flow"}
