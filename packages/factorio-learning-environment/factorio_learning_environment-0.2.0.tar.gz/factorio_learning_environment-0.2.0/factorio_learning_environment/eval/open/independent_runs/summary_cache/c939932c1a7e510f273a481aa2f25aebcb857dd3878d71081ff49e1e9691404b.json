Make sure there is a valid sink entity or storage space available to accept the items being transferred.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Verify that the source entity for inserters has the necessary items available for pickup. Ensure that the production chain is not interrupted upstream.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Output Full\n- Regularly extract items from furnaces to prevent them from becoming full and halting production. Consider using inserters to automate the extraction process.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Blocked by Items on Ground\n- Clear any items that may be blocking inserter operations. Ensure that the path is clear for inserters to function effectively."}
