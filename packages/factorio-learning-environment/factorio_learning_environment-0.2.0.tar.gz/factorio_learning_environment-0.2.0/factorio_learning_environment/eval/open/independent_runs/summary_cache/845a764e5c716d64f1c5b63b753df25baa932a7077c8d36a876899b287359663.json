{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0), extracting iron ore and dropping it into a wooden chest at position (-14.5, -48.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5), storing extracted iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0), smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-14.5, -46.5), transferring items from the chest to the furnace.\n\n### Coal Mining and Smelting Facility at Position (41.5, -80.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0), extracting coal and dropping it into a wooden chest at position (41.5, -80.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -80.5), storing extracted coal.\n- Stone Furnace at position (43.0, -82.0), smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (43.5, -80.5), transferring items from the chest to the furnace.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Insufficient Inventory Items\n- Ensure that you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into a structure. For example, attempting to insert iron ore into a furnace without having iron ore in your inventory will result in an error.\n\n### Errors when Furnaces are Full\n- Regularly check and empty the output slots of furnaces to prevent them from becoming full, which stops production.\n\n### Errors when Chests are Full\n- Ensure that chests have enough space to store incoming resources. Empty them regularly to avoid halting mining operations.\n\n### Errors when Inserters are Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that inserters have a steady supply of items to transfer. Check the source and destination inventories to ensure smooth operation."}
