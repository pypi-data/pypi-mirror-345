{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility at position (-23.0, -68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) extracting copper ore.\n- Transport Belts connecting the mining drill to a Wooden Chest at position (-23.5, -69.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (-23.5, -69.5) storing copper ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -70.0) and another at position (-18.0, -70.0) for smelting copper ore into copper plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-20.5, -66.5) waiting to move items from the belt to the furnace.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-12.5, -54.5) storing iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -65.0) and another at position (-21.0, -62.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-17.5, -64.5) moving iron plates from the furnace to a Wooden Chest at position (-16.5, -64.5).\n\n### Coal Extraction and Storage Facility at position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) extracting coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5) storing coal.\n\n### Belt Network\nConsists of multiple BeltGroups connecting various entities:\n- BeltGroup at position (-24.5, -70.5) connecting copper ore extraction to storage and processing.\n- BeltGroup at position (-17.5, -71.5) and others facilitating movement of resources between extraction, processing, and storage facilities.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entity (e.g., a chest or belt) has items available for the inserter to pick up. If the inserter is waiting, check the supply chain to ensure items are being delivered to the source entity.\n\n### No Ingredients to Smelt Warnings in Furnaces\n- Verify that the furnaces have a continuous supply of raw materials (e.g., copper ore or iron ore) to smelt. Ensure that the transport belts or inserters are correctly configured to deliver these materials to the furnaces.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entity (e.g., a chest or belt) has items available for the inserter to pick up. If the inserter is waiting, check the supply chain to ensure items are being delivered to the source entity."}
