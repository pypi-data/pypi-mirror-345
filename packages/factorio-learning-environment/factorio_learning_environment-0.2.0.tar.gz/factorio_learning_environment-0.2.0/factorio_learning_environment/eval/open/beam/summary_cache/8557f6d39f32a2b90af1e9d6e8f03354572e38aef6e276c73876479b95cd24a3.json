Insert the 10 iron ore into the first furnace to keep it working.\n2. Insert the remaining iron ore into the second furnace to maximize our production.\n3. Monitor the production of iron plates and ensure we have enough resources to craft additional entities.\n\nLet's proceed with inserting the iron ore into both furnaces.\n\"\"\"\n\n# 1.
