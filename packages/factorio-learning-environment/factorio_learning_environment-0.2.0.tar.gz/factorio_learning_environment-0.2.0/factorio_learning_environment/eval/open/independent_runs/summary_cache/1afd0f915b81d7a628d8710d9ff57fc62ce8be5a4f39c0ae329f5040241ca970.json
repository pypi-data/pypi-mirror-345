{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-20, -70)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -70.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-18.0, -70.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) extracting copper ore, connected to transport belts and a wooden chest at position (-23.5, -69.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Storage Facility at Position (-16.5, -64.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (-16.5, -64.5) storing iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-17.5, -64.5) waiting for source items, connected to the stone furnace at position (-19.0, -65.0) and wooden chest at position (-16.5, -64.5).\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Transport System at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) extracting iron ore, out of fuel.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-12.5, -54.5) storing iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5) waiting for source items, connected to transport belts and the wooden chest at position (-12.5, -54.5).\n\n### Miscellaneous Storage and Processing at Position (0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5) storing coal and iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) waiting for source items, connected to wooden chests at positions (1.5, 0.5) and (3.5, 0.5).\n\n### Belt Networks\n- Multiple BeltGroups connecting various parts of the factory, facilitating the movement of resources between furnaces, drills, and chests.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Attribute Errors with BeltGroup\n- Ensure that when accessing attributes of a BeltGroup, you are using valid properties. The 'direction' attribute does not exist on BeltGroup objects. Instead, access the direction of individual belts within the group.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Make sure that inserters have access to source items. Check the connectivity and availability of items on belts or in chests to prevent inserters from stalling.\n\n### Fuel Management for Burner Entities\n- Regularly check and refuel burner mining drills and inserters to prevent them from running out of fuel and halting production.\n\n### No Ingredients to Smelt in Furnaces\n- Ensure that furnaces are supplied with the necessary ingredients to maintain continuous production. Check the input logistics to ensure resources are being delivered to the furnaces efficiently."}
