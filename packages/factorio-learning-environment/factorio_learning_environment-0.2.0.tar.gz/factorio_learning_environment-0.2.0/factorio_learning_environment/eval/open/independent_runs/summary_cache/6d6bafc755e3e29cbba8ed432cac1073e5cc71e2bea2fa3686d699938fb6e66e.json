{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Steam Power System\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Boiler at position (-2.0, 23.5) with coal fuel\n- Steam engine at position (-5.5, 12.5)\n- Water pipe network:\n  - Horizontal pipes at y=23.5 from x=-8.5 to x=-3.5\n  - Vertical steam pipe line at x=-6.5 from y=16.5 to y=23.5\n  - Additional pipe groups at various positions for water/steam transport\n\n### Iron Mining and Smelting Setup\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-15.0, -50.0) mining iron ore\n- Wooden chest at (-14.5, -48.5) storing iron ore\n- Multiple stone furnaces for smelting iron:\n  - At (0.0, 0.0)\n  - At (2.0, 0.0) \n  - At (4.0, 4.0)\n  - At (6.0, 4.0)\n  - At (-14.0, -47.0)\n\n### Automation Science Pack Production\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine at (24.5, 4.5)\n- Input chest at (21.5, 4.5) with iron plates\n- Output chest at (27.5, 4.5) with copper plates and science packs\n- Two burner inserters:\n  - At (22.5, 4.5) moving items from input chest\n  - At (26.5, 4.5) moving items to output chest\n\n### Research Lab Network\nMultiple labs set up for research, currently researching automation technology\n- Labs contain varying amounts of automation science packs\n- Connected to electricity network with poles (though currently unpowered)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing pipes in occupied spaces\n- Check if target position is already occupied by another entity before placing\n- Remove existing pipes before attempting to place new ones at same location\n- Ensure placement location is not overlapping with other structures\n\n### Errors with pipe placement near water\n- Cannot place pipes directly over water tiles\n- Choose valid ground tiles for pipe placement\n\n### Distance related placement errors\n- Move closer to target location when placing entities\n- Maximum placement distance is 10 units from player position\n\n### Entity collision errors\n- Verify target location is clear of other entities before placement\n- Check for entity footprint overlaps when placing larger structures\n- Remove conflicting entities if needed before placing new ones\n\n### Power connection errors\n- Ensure proper connection between power producers and consumers\n- Check if steam system is properly connected and supplied with water/steam\n- Verify electrical pole connections form a complete network"}
