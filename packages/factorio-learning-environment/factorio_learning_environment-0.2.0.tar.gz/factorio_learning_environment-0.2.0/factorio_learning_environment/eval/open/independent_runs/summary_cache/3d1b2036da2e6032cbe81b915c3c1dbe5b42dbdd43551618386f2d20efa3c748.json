{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Iron Ore Mine at position (16.0, 71.0)\nConsists of a burner mining drill at position (16.0, 71.0), a wooden chest at position (15.5, 69.5), a burner inserter at position (14.5, 69.5), another burner inserter at position (16.5, 69.5), a stone furnace at position (16.0, 65.0), a burner inserter at position (16.5, 63.5) that inputs into the furnace, a belt group that connects the burner mining drill to the furnace, a wooden chest at position (18.5, 65.5), a burner inserter at position (17.5, 65.5) that inputs into the wooden chest, a burner inserter at position (18.5, 65.5), and a wooden chest at position (21.5, 67.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied positions\n- Ensure that the target position is not occupied by another entity before attempting to place an entity.\n\n### Errors when connecting entities with transport belts\n- Transport belts cannot be connected directly from or to a Prototype.WoodenChest object. You need to add an inserter that takes items from or inputs items into Prototype.WoodenChest and use the inserter as a source or target entity.\n\n### Errors when the target position is too far away or not a valid path\n- Ensure that you are close enough to the target position and that there is a valid path to it before attempting to place or connect entities.\n\n### Errors due to undefined variables or incorrect Prototype objects\n- Ensure that variables are defined before using them and that the correct Prototype object is used when placing entities.\n\n### Errors when getting non-existent entities or inserting items into a full inserter\n- Ensure that the entity exists at the specified position before attempting to get it and check if the inserter's inventory is full before attempting to insert items into it.\n\n## NAMESPACE\nNo utility functions have been defined by the agent.\n\nImportant variables:\n- `drill`: BurnerMiningDrill entity at position (16.0, 71.0)\n- `chest`: WoodenChest entity at position (15.5, 69.5)\n- `inserter`: BurnerInserter entity at position (14.5, 69.5)\n- `furnace`: StoneFurnace entity at position (16.0, 65.0)\n- `inserter`: BurnerInserter entity at position (16.5, 63.5)\n- `chest_inserter`: BurnerInserter entity at position (16.5, 69.5)\n- `coal_chest`: WoodenChest entity at position (18.5, 65.5)\n- `new_inserter`: BurnerInserter entity at position (17.5, 65.5)\n- `final_inserter`: BurnerInserter entity at position (18.5, 65.5)\n- `coal_chest`: WoodenChest entity at position (21.5, 67.5)"}
