This network manages the input and output of smelting operations, ensuring consistent ore-to-plate conversion.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Automation Setup\nConsists of a burner\u2011mining drill located at (\u201315.0, \u201350.0) paired with a nearby wooden chest at (\u201313.5, \u201351.5). Integrated within a transport\u2011belt network, this setup ensures efficient extraction and distribution of iron ore.\n\n### Steam Power Generation System\nConsists of a boiler at (8.0, 20.5) with connection points approximately at (8.5, 18.5) and (8.5, 22.5) and multiple steam engines positioned at (0.5, 9.5), (18.5, 11.5), (1.5, 13.5), (13.5, 14.5), (19.5, 14.5), (22.5, 18.5), (17.5, 20.5), (12.5, 21.5), and (4.5, 23.5). An extra steam engine\u2014intended to expand the power system\u2014remains unplaced due to severe spatial congestion. Repeated diagnostics reveal that overlapping burner\u2011inserters and misaligned transport belts are obstructing the clear buildable zone near (8.5, 22.5) adjacent to the boiler.\n\n### Automation Research Lab\nConfigured for automation science pack research, the lab continues to experience unstable power connectivity despite ongoing operations.\n\n### Electrical, Transport, and Fluid Infrastructure\nComprises interconnected electrical poles, extensive belt groups, and diverse pipe networks. This integrated backbone supports the coordinated distribution of power, materials, and fluids across the map.\n\n### Offshore Pump and Fluid Network\nConsists of an offshore pump at (0.5, 30.5) feeding into connected pipe groups. This network supplies water to support various fluid-dependent processes.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 Extra Steam Engine Placement Issue  \n  - The extra steam engine remains unplaceable due to extreme spatial congestion in the boiler zone at (8.0, 20.5), where overlapping burner\u2011inserters and misaligned transport belts obstruct the designated clear buildable area near (8.5, 22.5).\n  - Recommendation: Thoroughly reassess the boiler area and its adjacent connection interfaces. Remove, reposition, or adjust interfering entities to free up sufficient buildable space, or consider relocating the extra steam engine to a less congested zone or modifying the boiler layout.\n\n\u2022 Fuel Supply Shortages in Burner\u2011Powered Entities  \n  - Burner\u2011powered machines frequently report fuel shortages.\n  - Recommendation: Ensure that fuel sources are placed immediately adjacent to burner\u2011powered entities and verify that transport\u2011belt routing reliably delivers fuel to these machines.\n\n\u2022 Steam Engine Connectivity and Fluid Input Deficiencies  \n  - Multiple steam engines generate warnings about being disconnected from the power network and lacking adequate fluid input.\n  - Recommendation: Reexamine and reconfigure electrical wiring and fluid piping systems to secure stable network connections and ensure a consistent supply of input fluids.\n\n\u2022 Laboratory Power Instability  \n  - The Automation Research Lab continues to suffer from unstable power connectivity.\n  - Recommendation: Reevaluate the placement and wiring of nearby electrical poles and supporting power infrastructure to enhance the lab\u2019s power stability."}
