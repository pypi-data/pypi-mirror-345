For example, 'EntityCore' objects do not have a 'prototype_name' attribute. Verify the object's class and available attributes before attempting to access them.\n\n### Errors when Using Inspect Inventory Function\n- When using the `inspect_inventory` function, ensure that the first argument is either an Entity or Position object. Passing incorrect object types, such as 'EntityCore', will result in errors. Validate the object type before calling the function."}
