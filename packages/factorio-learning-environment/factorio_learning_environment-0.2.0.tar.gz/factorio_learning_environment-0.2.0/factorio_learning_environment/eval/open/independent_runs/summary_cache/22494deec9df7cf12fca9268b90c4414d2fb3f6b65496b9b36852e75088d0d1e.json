{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-11.5, 26.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-11.5, 26.5)\n- Boiler expected at position (-3.5, 26.0) (placement unsuccessful)\n- Steam Engine (not placed yet)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with coal fuel\n- Stone Furnace at position (10.0, 0.0) with coal fuel\n- Stone Furnace at position (13.0, 0.0) with coal fuel\n- Stone Furnace at position (16.0, 0.0) with coal fuel\n- Multiple wooden chests and burner inserters facilitating the transfer of materials between chests and furnaces\n\n### Pipe Network\nConsists of multiple PipeGroups connecting various positions:\n- PipeGroup at position (17.5, 3.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (-0.5, 11.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (5.5, 18.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (-9.5, 21.5)\n- Additional PipeGroups at various positions indicating attempts to connect the fluid system\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of an ElectricityGroup with poles at various positions, including (7.5, 8.5), (1.5, 6.5), and more, with a voltage of 0 indicating no power supply.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors When Placing Pipes\n- Ensure the target tile is unoccupied before attempting to place pipes. Avoid placing pipes where there are obstacles or existing entities.\n- Avoid placing pipes where the entity footprint overlaps with water. Choose a different location for placement.\n\n### Errors During Automatic Pipe Connection\n- Verify that the start and end positions for automatic pipe connections are valid and unobstructed.\n- Ensure that the entities intended for connection exist at the specified positions.\n\n### Errors When Placing Boiler\n- Verify that the intended position for placing the boiler is free of obstacles and suitable for placement.\n- Ensure that the dimensions provided for the boiler are valid integers to avoid validation errors.\n\n### Errors When Retrieving Entities\n- Confirm that the entity exists at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it. Adjust the position if necessary.\n\n### General Placement Errors\n- Always check for existing objects at the target location before attempting to place new entities to avoid conflicts."}
