{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-16.0, -51.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (4 units)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Warnings: Output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Neighbours: Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0)\n  - Resources: Iron Ore (40,000 units)\n  - Drop Position: (-16.5, -52.5)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-14.0, -49.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (14 units)\n  - Status: No Ingredients\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Furnace Result: Iron Plate (60 units)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- **Cannot place Burner Inserter/Wooden Chest/Stone Furnace/Transport Belt at the desired location**: Ensure the target location is unoccupied and suitable for the entity type before attempting to place it.\n\n### Errors related to fuel management\n- **Could not insert: No coal to insert from your inventory**: Ensure you have sufficient coal in your inventory before attempting to insert it into an entity.\n\n### Programming Errors\n- **NameError: name 'ore_furnace' is not defined**: Verify that all variables are correctly defined and initialized before use. Double-check for typos or incorrect variable names.\n\n### Output Blockage Warnings\n- **Output blocked by item on the ground**: Ensure there is a sink entity, such as a chest or another processing unit, to accept the output from the mining drill to prevent blockage.\n\n### Resource Management\n- **No ingredients to smelt in the Furnace**: Ensure that the furnace has the necessary raw materials to process, such as iron ore, to avoid idle time."}
