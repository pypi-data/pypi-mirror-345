{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (7 units)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Warnings: Output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Neighbours: Stone Furnace\n  - Drop Position: (x=-16.5, y=-52.5)\n  - Resources: Iron Ore (40,000 units)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (14 units)\n  - Status: No Ingredients\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Furnace Result: Iron Plate (60 units)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied locations\n- Ensure the target tile is unoccupied before attempting to place any entity, such as Wooden Chests, Burner Inserters, Stone Furnaces, or Transport Belts.\n\n### Errors when retrieving or interacting with non-existent entities\n- Verify the existence of an entity at the specified position before attempting to interact with it. For instance, ensure a Stone Furnace is present at the intended coordinates before calling any functions on it.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient inventory items\n- Check the inventory for the required items, such as coal, before attempting to insert them into machines or drills.\n\n### Errors when moving entities to invalid locations\n- Confirm that the destination location is valid and unoccupied before attempting to move entities like Stone Furnaces.\n\n### Errors due to blocked outputs\n- Ensure there is a sink entity in place to accept outputs from machines like Burner Mining Drills to prevent blockage warnings."}
