{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, -60.0) with a drop position at (4.5, -58.5). This drill is currently working and has a warning that the chest at the drop position is full.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (4.5, -58.5) containing iron ore.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (-15.0, -48.0), (-13.0, -48.0), and (-11.0, -48.0), each with coal as fuel and iron ore as input, producing iron plates.\n\n### Storage System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Iron Chest** at position (-5.5, -50.5) containing iron ore and iron plates.\n- Multiple **Wooden Chests** at various positions storing iron plates, some of which are full, indicating a need for better inventory management.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Full Chests\n- Ensure that chests used for storing mined resources or produced items are regularly emptied to prevent production halts due to full inventory warnings.\n\n### Errors with Mining Drill Output\n- Regularly check and clear the output chests of mining drills to maintain continuous mining operations. The warning indicates that the chest at the drop position is full, which stops further mining.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined by the agent in the provided steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `iron_ore: int` - Represents the quantity of iron ore in the inventory.\n- `iron_plate: int` - Represents the quantity of iron plates in the inventory.\n- `coal: int` - Represents the quantity of coal in the inventory, used as fuel for furnaces and mining drills.\n\nThe report provides a concise overview of the existing structures, error tips, and namespace details based on the agent's actions and the current state of the game environment."}
