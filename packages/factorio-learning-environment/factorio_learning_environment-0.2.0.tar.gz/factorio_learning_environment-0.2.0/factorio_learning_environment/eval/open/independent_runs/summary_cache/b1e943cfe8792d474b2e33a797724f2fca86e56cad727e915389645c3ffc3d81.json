{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=-5.5, y=24.0)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=-1.5, y=24.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=-5.5, y=24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\n- Connected with a Pipe Group spanning positions including (x=-8.5, y=23.5) to (x=0.5, y=22.5)\n- Supported by an Electricity Group with poles at positions including (x=-1.5, y=26.5), (x=-0.5, y=26.5), and (x=0.5, y=26.5)\n\n### Copper Plate Furnace at Position (x=6.0, y=-62.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=6.0, y=-62.0)\n\n### Research Lab\nConsists of:\n- Lab with input for automation-science-pack at position (not specified)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities at specific positions\n- Ensure the entity type and position are correct when using the `get_entity` function. Verify that the entity exists at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it.\n\n### Errors due to incorrect attribute usage\n- When accessing attributes of a class or prototype, ensure that the attribute exists. For example, use the correct attribute name when accessing `Prototype` attributes, such as using `Prototype.SteamEngine` instead of `Prototype.Generator`."}
