{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Setup at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Neighbours: \n    - Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5)\n    - Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -48.5)\n  - Warnings: Chest at drop position is full. Empty the chest at (-14.5, -48.5) to continue mining.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5)\n  - Contains: Iron ore (21 units)\n  - Status: Normal\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Warnings: Out of fuel\n  - Neighbours:\n    - Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5)\n    - Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0)\n    - Stone Furnace at position (-12.0, -48.0)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0)\n  - Status: No Ingredients\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Fuel: Coal (9 units)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Alignment\n- Ensure the inserter is correctly aligned and positioned to transfer materials from the chest to the furnace. Repeated repositioning indicates misalignment issues.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Fueling\n- Regularly check and refuel inserters to ensure continuous operation. Inserters running out of fuel can disrupt the material transfer process.\n\n### Errors with Chest Management\n- Regularly monitor and manage the inventory of the chest to prevent it from becoming full. A full chest stops the mining drill from operating effectively.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Ingredients\n- Ensure the furnace is receiving the necessary ingredients to smelt. Regularly check the setup to confirm that the inserter is correctly transferring iron ore to the furnace."}
