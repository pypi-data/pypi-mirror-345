{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nNo structures have been created yet. The map currently has no entities placed, and the agent's inventory remains unchanged with items such as wooden chests, transport belts, burner inserters, stone furnaces, wood, coal, iron plates, iron gear wheels, stone, and copper ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure you can place an entity on a tile before attempting to place it. The agent attempted to place wooden chests and transport belts at various coordinates (e.g., x=30.0 y=30.0, x=40.5 y=-82.5, x=45.0 y=-85.0, x=50.0 y=-90.0, x=0.0 y=0.0, x=100.0 y=-150.0, x=65.0 y=-105.0) but was unable to do so. Verify that the target tile is unoccupied and suitable for the entity being placed."}
