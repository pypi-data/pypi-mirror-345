{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (4 units)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Drop Position: (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Neighbours: Wooden Chest, Burner Inserter\n  - Resources: Iron Ore (10,000 units)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Inventory: Iron Ore (16 units)\n  - Status: Normal\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Fuel: Coal (4 units)\n  - Status: Waiting for Source Items\n  - Pickup Position: (x=-12.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Drop Position: (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Neighbours: Wooden Chest, Burner Mining Drill, Stone Furnace\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (6 units)\n  - Status: No Ingredients\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Setup Errors\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items from the chest to the furnace. Check the pickup and drop positions to ensure they are correctly set.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Iron Ore\n- Verify that the inserter is operational and has a clear path to transfer iron ore from the chest to the furnace. Ensure the inserter is fueled and correctly aligned.\n\n### Chest Full Warning\n- Regularly check the chest inventory to prevent it from becoming full. Empty the chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) to allow continuous mining operations.\n\n### Fuel Management\n- Ensure all entities requiring fuel, such as the burner mining drill and inserter, are regularly refueled with coal to maintain operational status."}
