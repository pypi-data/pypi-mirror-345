{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-10.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-10.0, -50.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-15.5, -53.5) for moving items, currently out of fuel.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -52.5) for moving items, currently out of fuel.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-9.5, -48.5) for moving items, currently out of fuel.\n\n### Belt System\n- BeltGroup with inputs from (x=-16.5, y=-54.5) to (x=-14.5, y=-54.5) and outputs from (x=-12.5, y=-54.5) to (x=-10.5, y=-54.5), consisting of 5 belts, currently empty.\n- BeltGroup with inputs from (x=-14.5, y=-50.5) to (x=-16.5, y=-50.5) and outputs from (x=-16.5, y=-55.5) to (x=-14.5, y=-55.5), consisting of 10 belts, currently empty.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Insufficient Fuel for Operations\n- Ensure that all furnaces and inserters are adequately refueled with coal or another suitable fuel source to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Errors When Extracting Items from Furnace\n- Verify that the stone furnace contains the expected items before attempting extraction. Ensure the furnace is fueled and has the necessary input materials to produce the desired output.\n\n### Errors When Connecting Belts Directly to Furnace\n- Use an inserter to connect belts to a furnace. Belts cannot be directly connected to a furnace; an inserter is required to transfer items between them.\n\n### Errors When Finding Suitable Position for Burner Inserter\n- Ensure there is enough space and no obstructions at the intended position for placing a burner inserter. Check the surrounding area for any existing entities that might block placement.\n\n### Attribute Errors with Position Objects\n- Verify that the position object has the correct attributes and methods available. Ensure that the code correctly references attributes like `pickup_position` and `drop_position`.\n\n### Crafting Errors Due to Missing Ingredients\n- Ensure all required ingredients are available in the inventory before attempting to craft items. For transport belts, ensure there are enough iron plates available, as they cannot be crafted manually without a furnace or assembling machine."}
