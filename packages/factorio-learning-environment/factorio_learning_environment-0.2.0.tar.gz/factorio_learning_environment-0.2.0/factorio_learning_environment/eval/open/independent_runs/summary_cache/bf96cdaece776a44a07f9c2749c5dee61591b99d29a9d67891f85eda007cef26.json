{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) used for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (0.5, -1.5) used to insert items into the furnace.\n- Transport Belt connecting the chest inserter at position (-13.5, -51.5) to the furnace inserter at position (0.5, -1.5).\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Transport System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) for extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-15.5, -51.5) for storing extracted iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -51.5) for moving iron ore from the chest to the transport belt.\n- BeltGroup connecting the mining drill to the furnace, facilitating the transport of iron ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Undefined Variable Errors\n- Ensure that all variables are defined before use. In step 17, the agent attempted to use `mining_drill_position` which was not defined. Double-check variable names and ensure they are correctly initialized.\n\n### Extraction Errors from Furnace\n- Before attempting to extract items from a furnace, verify that the furnace contains the desired items. In step 23, an attempt was made to extract iron plates from a furnace that did not contain them. Regularly check the furnace inventory to avoid such errors.\n\n### Inserter and Belt Blockage\n- Ensure that the destination for inserters is not blocked. The burner inserter at position (0.5, -1.5) reported a blockage in the furnace belt. Regularly monitor inserter status and clear any blockages to maintain efficient item flow.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `extract_item`: Used for extracting items from entities. Ensure the target entity contains the item before extraction to avoid exceptions.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `mining_drill_position`: Intended to store the position of the mining drill but was not defined, leading to a NameError.\n- `extracted_plates`: Used to store the number of iron plates extracted from the furnace. Ensure the furnace contains the correct items before assigning values to this variable."}
