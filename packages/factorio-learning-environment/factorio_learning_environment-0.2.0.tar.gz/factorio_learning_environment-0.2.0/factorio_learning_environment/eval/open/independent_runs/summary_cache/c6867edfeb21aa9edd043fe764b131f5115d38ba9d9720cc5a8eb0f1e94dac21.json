{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Coal Mining and Smelting Setup at Position (x=41.0, y=-86.0)\n- **Burner Mining Drills**: \n  - Position (x=41.0, y=-86.0) - Mining coal, out of fuel.\n  - Position (x=43.0, y=-86.0) - Mining coal, out of fuel, chest at drop position full.\n- **Chests**:\n  - Position (x=43.5, y=-84.5) - Contains 358 coal.\n  - Position (x=41.5, y=-82.5) - Contains 727 coal.\n- **Burner Inserters**:\n  - Position (x=41.5, y=-83.5) - Transfers coal from belt to chest.\n  - Position (x=43.5, y=-80.5) - Transfers coal to furnace.\n- **Furnace**:\n  - Position (x=43.0, y=-79.0) - Stone furnace, no ingredients to smelt.\n- **Additional Chests**:\n  - Position (x=41.5, y=-79.5) - Empty.\n  - Position (x=43.5, y=-76.5) - Empty.\n\n#### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Setup at Position (x=-17.0, y=-52.0)\n- **Burner Mining Drills**:\n  - Position (x=-17.0, y=-52.0) - Mining iron ore, out of fuel, chest at drop position full.\n- **Chests**:\n  - Position (x=-16.5, y=-50.5) - Contains 58 iron ore.\n  - Position (x=-13.5, y=-51.5) - Empty.\n- **Burner Inserters**:\n  - Position (x=-14.5, y=-52.5) - Transfers iron ore to furnace.\n  - Position (x=-17.5, y=-50.5) - Transfers iron ore to chest.\n- **Furnaces**:\n  - Position (x=-15.0, y=-51.0) - Stone furnace, no ingredients to smelt.\n  - Position (x=-13.0, y=-50.0) - Stone furnace, no ingredients to smelt.\n\n---\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when placing entities next to existing structures\n- **Issue**: Repeated attempts to place a burner inserter next to the furnace at (x=-15.0, y=-51.0) failed due to collisions or invalid placement.\n- **Solution**: \n  - Ensure the target position is free of obstructions (e.g., water, other entities).\n  - Adjust the spacing or direction when placing entities next to existing structures.\n  - Verify the reference position and nearby entities before attempting placement.\n\n#### Errors with mining drills and furnaces\n- **Issue**: Mining drills are out of fuel, and furnaces lack ingredients to smelt.\n- **Solution**:\n  - Refuel mining drills with coal or other fuel sources.\n  - Ensure furnaces have a steady supply of raw materials (e.g., iron ore) and fuel.\n\n#### Errors with chests being full\n- **Issue**: Chests at drop positions for mining drills are full, halting mining operations.\n- **Solution**:\n  - Empty chests regularly to allow mining drills to continue operation.\n  - Expand storage capacity or add additional chests to handle excess resources.\n\n#### Errors with inserters waiting for source items\n- **Issue**: Inserters are idle due to a lack of items to transfer.\n- **Solution**:\n  - Ensure a steady supply of items is available at the pickup position.\n  - Check belt connections and mining drill outputs to maintain resource flow."}
