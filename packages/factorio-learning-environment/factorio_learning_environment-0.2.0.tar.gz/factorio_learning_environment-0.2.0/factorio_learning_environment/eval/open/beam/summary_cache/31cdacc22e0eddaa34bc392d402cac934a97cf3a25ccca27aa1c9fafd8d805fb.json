{"content": "I notice a pattern in the errors - we're having trouble placing the burner mining drill. Let's analyze the issues:\n\n1. We can't place entities more than 10 units away from our current position\n2. The mining drill needs to be placed on an actual resource patch\n3. We need to be close enough to the resource to place entities\n\nLet's try a simpler approach:\n\n```python\n# First find nearest iron ore\niron_pos = nearest(Resource.IronOre)\nprint(f\"Found iron ore at: {iron_pos}\")\n\n# Move to the iron ore position\nmove_to(iron_pos)\nprint(f\"Moved to iron ore at: {iron_pos}\")\n\n# Get our current position\ncurrent_pos = get_position()\nprint(f\"Current position: {current_pos}\")\n\n# Check what resources are under us\nresources = get_resources(radius=5)\nprint(f\"Resources nearby: {resources}\")\n\n# Now try to place the mining drill directly on the iron ore\ndrill = place_entity(\n    Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill,\n    position=current_pos\n)\nprint(f\"Placed mining drill at: {drill.position}\")\n\n# Add fuel to the drill\ninsert_item(Prototype.Coal, drill, quantity=5)\nprint(f\"Added fuel to drill\")\n\n# Check drill status\nprint(f\"Drill status: {drill.status}\")\n```\n\nThis approach should help us:\n1. Confirm we're actually on an iron ore patch\n2. Ensure we're close enough to place entities\n3. Verify the exact position where we can place the mining drill\n\nLet's see if this helps us identify why the placement is failing.", "summary_range": "[1-2528]"}
