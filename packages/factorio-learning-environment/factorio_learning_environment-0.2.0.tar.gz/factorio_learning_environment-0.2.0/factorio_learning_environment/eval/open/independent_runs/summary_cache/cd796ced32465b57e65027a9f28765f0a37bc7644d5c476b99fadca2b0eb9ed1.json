Check the chest's inventory before extraction.\n\n#### Errors when inserting items into a furnace\n- Ensure the furnace has space in its input inventory before inserting items. Clear the furnace's input inventory if it is full.\n\n#### Errors when inserting coal into a mining drill\n- Ensure you have coal in your inventory before attempting to insert it into a mining drill. Check your inventory for coal.\n\n#### Errors when the chest at the drop position is full\n- Empty the chest at the drop position to allow the mining drill to continue mining. Regularly check and clear the chest's inventory.\n\n#### Errors when smelting is not working\n- Ensure the furnace has both fuel and input ingredients before starting the smelting process. Check the furnace's fuel and input inventory.\n\n#### Errors when the inserter is waiting for source items\n- Ensure the inserter has access to items to transfer. Check the source entity's inventory and position."}
