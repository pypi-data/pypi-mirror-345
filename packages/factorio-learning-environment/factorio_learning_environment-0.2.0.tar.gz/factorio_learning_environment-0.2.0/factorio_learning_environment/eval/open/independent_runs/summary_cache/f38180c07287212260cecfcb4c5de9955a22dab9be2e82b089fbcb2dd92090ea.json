Check the connected belts and chests for blockages or shortages.\n\n#### Inventory Full Errors\n- Regularly monitor the inventory of chests and ensure they are not full before attempting to insert items. Consider using larger storage solutions like iron chests or distributing items more efficiently.\n\n#### No Iron Ore to Insert\n- Maintain a sufficient supply of iron ore in your inventory before attempting to insert it into furnaces. Regularly check and replenish resources as needed.\n\n#### Inserter Output Blocked\n- Ensure there is a destination entity available to receive items from inserters. Avoid placing items on the ground where they block inserter operations.\n\n#### Inserter Out of Fuel\n- Keep inserters fueled to maintain their operation. Regularly check and refuel inserters to prevent them from stopping due to lack of fuel."}
