{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-16.0, -51.0)\n  - Fuel: Inventory({'coal': 3})\n  - Status: Working\n  - Warnings: Output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Neighbours: Entity(name='stone-furnace', direction=DOWN, position=Position(x=-14.0, y=-49.0))\n  - Drop Position: Position(x=-16.5, y=-52.5)\n  - Resources: [Ingredient(name='iron-ore', count=40000, type=None)]\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-14.0, -49.0)\n  - Fuel: Inventory({'coal': 14})\n  - Status: No Ingredients\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Furnace Source: Inventory({})\n  - Furnace Result: Inventory({'iron-plate': 60})\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied or invalid locations\n- Ensure the target tile is unoccupied and valid for the intended entity before attempting to place it. This includes checking for existing entities or obstructions.\n\n### Errors when moving entities to invalid locations\n- Verify that the destination for moving an entity is valid and unoccupied to prevent errors.\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities from specific positions\n- Confirm the presence of the entity at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it to avoid retrieval errors.\n\n### Errors due to lack of resources\n- Ensure sufficient resources are available in the inventory before attempting to insert them into entities. For example, ensure coal is available before trying to insert it into a drill.\n\n### Errors due to blocked outputs\n- Make sure there is a sink entity or clear the output area for entities like drills to prevent blockage warnings and ensure smooth operation."}
