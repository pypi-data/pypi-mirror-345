{"content": "It seems that the environment is only capturing and displaying the final print statement, \"End of detailed diagnostic check.\" This indicates that while the code is executing, the intermediate outputs are not being displayed. Here are some insights and suggestions to address this:\n\n### Observations:\n1. **Final Output Only**: The environment is capturing the last print statement, suggesting that the REPL might be configured to only show the final result or that intermediate outputs are being suppressed.\n\n2. **No Errors Reported**: There are no error messages, which implies that the code is executing without exceptions, but the outputs are not being displayed as expected.\n\n### Suggestions:\n1. **Output Configuration**: Check if there is a setting or configuration in the REPL environment that controls output verbosity or buffering. Some environments buffer outputs and only display them at the end of execution.\n\n2. **Step-by-Step Execution**: If possible, execute the code step-by-step, manually running each section to see if outputs are displayed. This can help determine if the issue is related to how the code is being executed as a whole.\n\n3. **Use Logging**: Instead of using print statements, try using a logging library or function that might be configured differently in the environment and could capture outputs more effectively.\n\n4. **Environment Documentation**: Review the documentation for the Factorio REPL environment to see if there are any known issues or specific instructions for capturing and displaying outputs.\n\n5. **Alternative Output Methods**: Consider writing outputs to a file or another medium that can be accessed after execution to verify that the operations are being performed correctly.\n\n6. **Consult Support**: If the issue persists, consider reaching out to support channels or community forums related to the Factorio REPL environment for further assistance.\n\nBy following these suggestions, you should be able to diagnose why intermediate outputs are not being displayed and find a workaround or solution to capture them effectively.", "summary_range": "[1-390]"}
