{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Offshore Pump at position(-10.5, 25.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump (position -10.5, 25.5) which is currently working and connected to a fluid system.\n- Pipe (position -10.5, 24.5) connecting the offshore pump to the boiler.\n\n### Boiler at position(-4.5, 24.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Boiler (position -4.5, 24.0) which is not connected to a power network and has no input liquid.\n\n### Small Electric Pole at position(-7.5, 23.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Small Electric Pole (position -7.5, 23.5) connected to the boiler.\n\n### Lab at position(7.5, -12.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab (position 7.5, -12.5) which is currently not powered.\n\n### Steam Engine at position(-0.5, -9.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine (position -0.5, -9.5) which is not connected to a power network.\n\n### Furnace at position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace (position 0.0, 0.0) which has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Furnace at position(5.0, 5.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace (position 5.0, 5.0) which has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing pipes\n- Ensure that the arguments passed to the pipe placement function are correct and that the direction is specified properly.\n\n### Errors when placing electric poles\n- Ensure that you are within the maximum distance allowed to place the electric pole. Move closer to the target position if necessary.\n- Check if there is already an entity occupying the target position before attempting to place an electric pole.\n\n### Errors when connecting entities\n- Ensure that the entities you are trying to connect (e.g., boiler and offshore pump) are properly aligned and that there are no obstructions in the way."}
