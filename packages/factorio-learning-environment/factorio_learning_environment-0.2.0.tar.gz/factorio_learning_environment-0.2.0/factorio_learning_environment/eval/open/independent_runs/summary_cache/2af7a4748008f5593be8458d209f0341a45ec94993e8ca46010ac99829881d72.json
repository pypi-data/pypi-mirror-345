{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0) with fuel inventory of coal and warnings about output being blocked.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0) with fuel inventory of coal and warnings about no ingredients to smelt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied or invalid locations\n- Ensure the target location is free before placing entities like Burner Inserters, Wooden Chests, Transport Belts, and Stone Furnaces. Attempting to place these entities at occupied or invalid locations will result in errors.\n\n### Errors due to undefined variables in code\n- Verify that all variables are defined before use. For example, ensure that 'ore_furnace' is correctly defined and accessible in the code context to avoid NameError.\n\n### Errors when inserting items without sufficient inventory\n- Check inventory levels before attempting to insert items into entities. Ensure you have the required items in your inventory to avoid exceptions related to insufficient items.\n\n### Errors due to blocked outputs\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity or a clear path for outputs from entities like Burner Mining Drills to prevent blockage warnings and ensure continuous operation.\n\n### Errors due to missing ingredients for smelting\n- Ensure that the Stone Furnace has the necessary ingredients to smelt to avoid warnings about no ingredients being available."}
