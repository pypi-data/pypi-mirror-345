It contains 24 units of copper ore and has 15 iron plates as output.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities without having them in inventory\n- Ensure that the entity you want to place is available in your inventory before attempting to place it. For example, attempting to place a stone furnace without having it in your inventory will result in an error.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient crafting materials\n- Verify that you have all the required materials in your inventory before attempting to craft an item. For instance, crafting a stone furnace requires 5 stones, and attempting to craft it without sufficient stones will cause an error.\n\n### Errors when trying to find non-existent entities\n- Ensure that the entity you are trying to locate exists on the map. For example, attempting to find the nearest stone furnace when none has been placed will result in an error.\n\n### Errors due to lack of fuel or ingredients in furnaces\n- Make sure to have the necessary fuel and ingredients in your inventory before attempting to use a furnace. For instance, trying to insert coal into a furnace without having coal in your inventory will cause an error.\n\n### Errors when attempting to use unavailable furnaces\n- Ensure that you have additional stone furnaces available in your inventory before attempting to place or use them. An assertion error will occur if you try to use a furnace when none are available in your inventory.\n\n### Errors when inserting items without having them in inventory\n- Ensure you have the items you wish to insert into a structure in your inventory. For example, attempting to insert iron ore into a furnace without having iron ore in your inventory will result in an error.\n\n### Errors when attempting to craft without unlocking technology\n- Ensure that you have researched the necessary technology before attempting to craft items that require it. For example, attempting to craft an assembling machine without unlocking the automation technology will result in an error.\n\n### Errors when attempting to use unavailable assembling machines\n- Ensure that you have assembling machines available in your inventory before attempting to place or use them. An assertion error will occur if you try to use an assembling machine when none are available in your inventory.\n\n### Errors due to lack of crafting machines for specific recipes\n- Some items require specific crafting machines or smelting in a furnace. For example, crafting copper plates requires a furnace. Ensure you have access to the necessary equipment before attempting to craft such items.\n\n### Errors when extracting items from furnaces without valid contents\n- Ensure that the furnace contains the items you wish to extract. For instance, attempting to extract copper plates from a furnace that does not contain them will result in an error."}
