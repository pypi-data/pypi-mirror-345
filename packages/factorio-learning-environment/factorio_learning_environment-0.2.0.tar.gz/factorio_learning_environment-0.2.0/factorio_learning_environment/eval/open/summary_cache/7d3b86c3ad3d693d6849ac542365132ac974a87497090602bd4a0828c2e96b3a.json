{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, -0.5)\n- Boiler at position (-6.0, -0.5)\n- Steam engine at position (-2.5, -0.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting the offshore pump to the boiler with pipes at positions [(x=-6.5, y=-2.5), (x=-7.5, y=-2.5), (x=-8.5, y=-0.5), (x=-7.5, y=-1.5), (x=-7.5, y=-0.5)]\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Operation\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Electric mining drill at position (15.5, 70.5) with a transport belt connected from position (15.5, 72.5) to (15.5, 82.5)\n- Electric mining drill at position (18.5, 70.5) with a transport belt connected from position (18.5, 72.5) to (18.5, 82.5)\n- BeltGroup connecting the mining drills to the transport belts\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Electric Poles\n- Ensure that the electric poles are correctly connected to the intended entities. Verify that the entities are within range and that there are no nil values in the connection process.\n\n### Errors when Finding Nearest Steam Engine\n- Confirm that the steam engine is placed on the map before attempting to find it. Ensure that the search function is correctly accessing the map data.\n\n### Assertion Errors for Power Supply\n- Ensure that all drills and other power-dependent entities are properly connected to a power source. Verify that the electricity network is complete and functional.\n\n### Errors in Pipe Connections\n- Check that there are no blockages between the source and target entities when connecting pipes. Ensure that the fluid can flow from the source to the target without obstruction.\n\n### ValueError with Entity Arguments\n- When using functions that accept entity objects, ensure that the second argument is None if required by the function signature.\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities on Occupied Tiles\n- Before placing an entity, verify that the target tile is unoccupied. Adjust the placement logic to handle cases where the tile is already occupied by another object.\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities Too Far Away\n- Move closer to the target position before attempting to place an entity. Ensure that the player is within the maximum allowed distance for placement.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n- No user-defined functions or important variables were identified in the logs provided."}
