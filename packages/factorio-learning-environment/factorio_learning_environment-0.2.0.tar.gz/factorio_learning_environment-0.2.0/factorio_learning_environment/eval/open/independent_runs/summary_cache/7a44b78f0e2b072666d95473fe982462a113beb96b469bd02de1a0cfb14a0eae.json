{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Coal Storage and Distribution System at position (41.5, -80.5)\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (41.5, -80.5) with empty inventory.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (43.5, -80.5) containing 39 coal.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (42.5, -80.5) transferring coal from the chest at (41.5, -80.5) to the chest at (43.5, -80.5).\n\n#### Iron Plate Smelting Facility at position (52.0, -79.0)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (52.0, -79.0) with 26 coal in fuel inventory, currently idle due to lack of ingredients.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (53.5, -79.5) waiting to transfer items from the furnace to the chest at (54.5, -79.5).\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (54.5, -79.5) containing 336 iron plates.\n\n#### Iron Ore Mining Operation at position (-15.0, -50.0)\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) out of fuel and unable to mine due to a full chest at (-14.5, -48.5).\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5) with empty inventory.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5) waiting to transfer items from the mining drill to the chest at (-14.5, -48.5).\n\n#### General Storage Area at position (0.5, 0.5)\n- Multiple **Wooden Chests** at positions (0.5, 0.5), (1.5, 0.5), (2.5, 0.5), (3.5, 0.5), (4.5, 0.5), and (5.5, 0.5) containing various items including coal, iron ore, iron plates, and iron gear wheels.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Issues with Fuel and Resource Management\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) is out of fuel and cannot operate. Ensure the drill is fueled with coal to resume mining.\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) is also unable to mine because the chest at (-14.5, -48.5) is full. Empty the chest to allow mining to continue.\n\n#### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (42.5, -80.5) is waiting for source items. Ensure there are items in the chest at (41.5, -80.5) for the inserter to transfer.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (53.5, -79.5) is waiting for source items. Ensure the furnace at (52.0, -79.0) has ingredients to smelt.\n\n#### Furnace Idle Due to Lack of Ingredients\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (52.0, -79.0) is idle because it has no ingredients to smelt. Provide iron ore to the furnace to resume smelting.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- **Variables:**\n  - `coal`: `Inventory` type, used to store coal in various chests.\n  - `iron_ore`: `Inventory` type, used to store iron ore in chests.\n  - `iron_plate`: `Inventory` type, used to store iron plates in chests.\n  - `iron_gear_wheel`: `Inventory` type, used to store iron gear wheels in chests.\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - **`transfer_items(source, destination, item)`**: Attempts to transfer items from `source` to `destination`. Fails if the source is empty or the destination is full.\n  - **`fuel_entity(entity, fuel_type)`**: Attempts to fuel an entity like a burner mining drill or furnace. Fails if the entity is already fueled or if the fuel type is incorrect."}
