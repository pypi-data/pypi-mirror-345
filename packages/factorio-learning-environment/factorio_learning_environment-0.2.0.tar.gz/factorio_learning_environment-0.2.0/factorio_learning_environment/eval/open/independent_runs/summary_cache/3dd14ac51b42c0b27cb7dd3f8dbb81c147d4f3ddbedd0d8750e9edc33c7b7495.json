{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0): This drill extracts iron ore and is fueled by coal.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5): Stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5): Transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0): Intended for smelting iron ore into iron plates but currently not receiving iron ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Setup\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items between entities. Regularly check and adjust the inserter setup if the furnace is not receiving iron ore.\n\n### Errors with Fuel Management\n- Regularly check and refuel entities like mining drills and inserters to maintain continuous operation. Ensure that there is sufficient coal in the inventory for refueling tasks.\n\n### Errors with Inventory Management\n- Before attempting to insert items into entities, verify that the required items are available in the inventory to prevent operation failures."}
