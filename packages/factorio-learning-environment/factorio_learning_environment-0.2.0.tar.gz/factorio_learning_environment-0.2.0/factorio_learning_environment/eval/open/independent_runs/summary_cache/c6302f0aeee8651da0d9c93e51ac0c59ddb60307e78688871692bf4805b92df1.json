{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-47.5, -122.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\n- Pipe at Position (-47.5, -122.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-46.5, -121.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (-41.5, -117.5)\n- Small Electric Pole at Position (-39.5, -116.5)\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-19.0, -73.0) with copper plates in output\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0) with iron plates in output\n\n### Additional Furnace Setup\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0) without ingredients\n\n### Inserter and Storage System\nConsists of:\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (6.5, -59.5) with iron plates in inventory\n- Small Electric Poles at Positions (5.5, -60.5), (7.5, -60.5), (5.5, -59.5)\n\n### Research Lab\nConsists of:\n- Lab with automation science packs, lacking power\n\n### Pipe Networks\nConsists of multiple Pipe Groups:\n- Pipe Group at Position (-47.5, -122.5) with water\n- Several other empty Pipe Groups at various positions\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of:\n- Multiple Small Electric Poles forming a network\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Boiler Connection Issues\n- Ensure that the boiler is correctly connected to the water source. Verify that all necessary pipes and connections are properly aligned and connected to the offshore pump.\n\n### Steam Engine Connection Issues\n- Ensure that the steam engine is connected to the power network and has a proper input of steam. Check the connections between the boiler and steam engine.\n\n### Inserter Power Supply Issues\n- Make sure that the inserter is connected to a power source. Verify the connection to the small electric poles and ensure they are part of a powered electricity network.\n\n### Furnace Ingredient Supply Issues\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Check the input inventory and supply chain to maintain a steady flow of resources.\n\nBy addressing these issues, the efficiency and functionality of the structures can be significantly improved."}
