{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nNo structures have been successfully created on the map. The agent attempted to place various entities, but all placement attempts failed. As a result, there are no existing structures to report.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities on non-buildable tiles\n- Ensure that the target position for placing an entity is buildable. The agent attempted to place Stone Furnaces and Wooden Chests at various positions (e.g., x=21.0 y=21.0, x=25.0 y=25.0, x=0.0 y=0.0) that were not buildable.\n  \n### Errors when placing entities without checking availability\n- Verify the availability of resources or space before attempting to place entities. The agent attempted to place entities like Wooden Chests and Transport Belts at positions that were not suitable for placement (e.g., x=0.0 y=0.0, x=45.0 y=-85.0).\n\n### Errors when placing entities without ensuring resource supply\n- Ensure that the necessary resources are available to supply to the entities being placed. The agent encountered issues with supplying coal to a Furnace, indicating a lack of resource management.\n\n### General placement errors\n- Double-check the environment and any global build restrictions before placing entities. The agent faced multiple placement failures due to environmental constraints or incorrect assumptions about buildable areas."}
