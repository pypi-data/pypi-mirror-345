{"content": "### Existing Structures\n\n### Copper plate factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n-  Furnace (position x=61.0, y=-52.0) with fuel={'coal': 6}, furnace_source={'copper-ore': 49}, and furnace_result={'copper-plate': 47}\n-  Furnace (position x=63.0, y=-52.0) with fuel={'coal': 5}, furnace_source={'copper-ore': 50}, and furnace_result={'copper-plate': 47}\n-  Furnace (position x=65.0, y=-52.0) with fuel={'coal': 1}, furnace_source={'copper-ore': 50}, and furnace_result={'copper-plate': 78}\n\n### Error Tips\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors related to furnace source being full\n- Monitor the fuel and resource levels in the furnaces to avoid the \"furnace source is full\" warning. Consider managing the input resources more effectively to prevent bottlenecks."}
