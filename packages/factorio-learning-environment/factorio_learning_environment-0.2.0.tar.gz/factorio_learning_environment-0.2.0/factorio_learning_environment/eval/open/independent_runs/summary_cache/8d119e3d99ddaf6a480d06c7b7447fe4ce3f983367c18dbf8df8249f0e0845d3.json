{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Coal Storage and Transfer System at position (41.5, -80.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest (position 41.5, -80.5) with empty inventory\n- Wooden chest (position 43.5, -80.5) containing coal\n- Burner inserter (position 42.5, -80.5) transferring items between the two chests\n\n#### Iron Smelting Setup at position (52.0, -79.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position 52.0, -79.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n- Burner inserter (position 53.5, -79.5) waiting for source items\n- Wooden chest (position 54.5, -79.5) containing iron plates\n- Burner inserter (position 55.5, -78.5) waiting for source items\n- Wooden chest (position 56.5, -78.5) with empty inventory\n\n#### Iron Ore Mining Setup at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position -15.0, -50.0) out of fuel\n- Wooden chest (position -14.5, -48.5) with empty inventory\n- Burner inserter (position -12.5, -48.5) waiting for source items\n- Burner inserter (position -13.5, -48.5) waiting for source items\n\n#### Resource Storage at position (0.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest (position 0.5, 0.5) containing various items including coal, iron ore, and iron plates\n- Wooden chest (position 1.5, 0.5) containing coal and iron ore\n- Wooden chest (position 2.5, 0.5) containing coal\n- Wooden chest (position 3.5, 0.5) containing coal\n- Wooden chest (position 4.5, 0.5) containing coal and iron ore\n- Wooden chest (position 5.5, 0.5) containing iron ore, iron plates, and iron gear wheels\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors related to fuel and resource management\n- Ensure that burner mining drills have sufficient fuel to operate. Add coal to the burner mining drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) to resume mining.\n- Empty the chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) to allow the burner mining drill to continue mining iron ore.\n\n#### Errors related to inserter operations\n- Ensure that inserters have source items available to transfer. Check the inventory of the chests and furnaces connected to the inserters at positions (42.5, -80.5), (53.5, -79.5), and (55.5, -78.5) to provide the necessary items for transfer.\n\n#### Errors related to furnace operations\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Add iron ore and coal to the stone furnace at position (52.0, -79.0) to resume smelting.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n#### Utility Functions\n- None defined yet.\n\n#### Important Variables\n- None assigned yet."}
