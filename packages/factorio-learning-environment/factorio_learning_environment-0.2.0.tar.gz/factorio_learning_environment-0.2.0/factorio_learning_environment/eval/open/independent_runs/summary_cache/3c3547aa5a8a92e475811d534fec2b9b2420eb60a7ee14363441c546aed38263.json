{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (14.5, 22.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam engine at position (14.5, 22.5)\n- Offshore pump at position (-7.5, 25.5)\n- Pipe group connecting offshore pump to steam engine, with various pipe segments including pipe-to-ground at positions such as (-8.5, 23.5) and (-7.5, 23.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Multiple stone furnaces at positions (0.0, 0.0), (10.0, 0.0), (13.0, 0.0), and (16.0, 0.0), each fueled by coal\n- Wooden chests at positions (8.5, -0.5), (17.5, -0.5), (19.5, -0.5), and (20.5, -0.5) for storage\n- Burner inserters at positions (8.5, 0.5), (17.5, 0.5), (19.5, 0.5), and (20.5, 0.5) for transferring items between chests and furnaces\n\n### Research Laboratory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab at position with input for automation science packs, currently not conducting research\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors When Placing Entities on Occupied Tiles\n- Ensure there is no existing object or unplaceable terrain (e.g., water) at the target location before attempting to place an entity.\n\n### Errors When Reconnecting Pipes\n- Verify that the target position for placing pipes is not already occupied by another entity. Remove any existing entities before proceeding.\n\n### Errors Due to Distance Limitations\n- Move closer to the target position when placing entities, as there is a maximum allowable distance for placement actions.\n\n### Errors When Accessing Non-Existent Entities\n- Confirm the presence of the intended entity at the specified position before attempting to access it. Ensure the entity is correctly placed and not obstructed.\n\n### Type Errors in Code\n- Review code for type mismatches, such as attempting to add incompatible types. Ensure that all operations are performed on compatible data types."}
