{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) supplying iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (41.0, -80.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility at Position (-21.0, -73.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-21.0, -73.0) supplying copper ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -71.0) for smelting copper ore into copper plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Smelting Operations\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. The stone furnaces at positions (41.0, -80.0) and (-20.0, -71.0) are currently showing warnings for \"no ingredients to smelt.\" Regularly check and supply the required ores to maintain production efficiency.\n\n### Errors Related to Output Blockage\n- The burner mining drill at position (-21.0, -73.0) has a warning indicating \"output blocked by item on the ground.\" Ensure that there is a sink entity, such as a furnace or a chest, to accept the output from the mining drill to prevent blockage and maintain continuous operation.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- None defined in the current steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `current_inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the current inventory of the agent, including items like 'stone-furnace', 'stone', 'iron-plate', and 'copper-plate'.\n- `entities_on_map`: List[Entity] - Represents the entities present on the map, including their positions and statuses."}
