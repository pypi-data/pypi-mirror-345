Its reported fluid_system value\u2014previously updated from 177250 through 178668\u2014has, after further forced connectivity attempts (steps 1527\u20131535), undergone successive changes (178858, 179070, 179260, 179472, 179662, 179874, 180064) and now finalizes at 180276.\n\u2013 Offshore Pump at (x=1.5, y=32.5) integrated through a PipeGroup.\n\u2013 Interlinking pipe connections ensuring water delivery.\n\u2013 Additional update: Although earlier API calls failed to retrieve a matching PipeGroup near (x=-30.5, y=29.5), a final overall entity scan now shows a PipeGroup with fluid_system=180276 at that location (status WORKING).\n\n### Expanded Smelting Zone\nConsists of:\n\u2013 Stone Furnaces at (x=-20.0, y=22.0), (x=-20.0, y=25.0) and (x=-17.0, y=25.0).\n\u2013 Stone Furnace at (x=0.0, y=26.0) dedicated to copper smelting.\n\u2013 (An intended Furnace at (x=-17.0, y=22.0) was not placed due to a blocking pipe group.)\n\u2013 Steam Engine (Generator) at (x=1.5, y=28.5) with connection points at (x=4.0, y=28.5) and (x=-1.0, y=28.5) that continues to warn of missing power/inputs.\n\u2013 Paired Burner Inserters at (x=-4.5, y=26.5) and (x=-3.5, y=27.5) showing out\u2011of\u2011fuel warnings and interfacing with adjacent transport belts.\n\n### New Network Structures\nConsists of:\n\u2013 Long\u2011distance Transport Belt Network spanning from (x=-3.5, y=10.5) to (x=22.5, y=10.5) with 29 belts (EMPTY).\n\u2013 Copper Ore Transport Line (region x\u22488\u20139, y\u224811\u201315) comprising 6 belts (WORKING; carrying copper\u2011ore).\n\u2013 Integrated Auxiliary Transport Network with a primary 23\u2011belt segment (EMPTY) and a secondary 16\u2011belt segment (EMPTY).\n\u2013 Short Belt Connectors:\n\u2003\u2022 Connector A: approximately (x\u2248\u20130.5 to \u20131.5, y\u224820.5) with 2 belts (EMPTY).\n\u2003\u2022 Connector B: around (x\u2248\u20134.5 to \u20135.5) with 2 belts (EMPTY).\n\u2013 Two standalone Transport Belts at (x=-2.5, y=26.5) and (x=-1.5, y=27.5).\n\n### Auxiliary Boiler\u2013Steam Engine Connection Attempts\nConsists of:\n\u2013 Steam Engine at (x=16.5, y=20.5) exhibiting connection failures.\n\u2013 Steam Engine at (x=21.5, y=19.5) with similar connectivity issues.\n\n### Remote Fluid Network Bridge at position (x=-0.5, y=5.5)\nConsists of:\n\u2013 Connected PipeGroup retrieved at (x=-0.5, y=5.5) with detailed segments starting at (x=-0.5, y=4.5) and extending through (x=-0.5, y=5.5) to (x=20.5, y=14.5) using 16+ pipes.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 Fluid System Fluctuation and Candidate Retrieval\n\u2003\u2013 Repeated forced connectivity attempts for the Remote Boiler\u2019s steam output have caused its fluid_system value to fluctuate repeatedly (values observed: 177250\u2026178668 previously, then 178858, 179070, 179260, 179472, 179662, 179874, 180064 and finally 180276). To mitigate this, ensure that the boiler\u2019s update mechanism is allowed sufficient time to stabilize before initiating subsequent connection attempts.\n\u2003\u2013 Although API calls (get_entities with PipeGroup filters) consistently returned 0 candidates near (x=-30.5, y=29.5) during these attempts, a final manual, comprehensive entity scan eventually identified a matching PipeGroup (now with fluid_system=180276 and status WORKING). Adjusting search tolerances and delay intervals may improve candidate retrieval accuracy.\n\n\u2022 Connection Placement Blockage\n\u2003\u2013 Verify that the intended connection path between the Remote Boiler\u2019s steam output and the target PipeGroup is unobstructed and that spatial coordinates are calculated precisely before forcing connections.\n\n\u2022 API Parameter and Consistency Verification\n\u2003\u2013 Reexamine search filters, placement tolerances, and expected fluid attributes on both the Remote Boiler and the candidate PipeGroup to reduce mismatches during connectivity attempts.\n\n\u2022 PipeGroup Retrieval Optimization\n\u2003\u2013 The inconsistency between API-filtered calls (which return no entities) and manual full scans (which reveal valid candidates) suggests a need to increase dynamic update delays and adjust tolerance radii to capture transient entity states.\n\n\u2022 General Error Mitigations\n\u2003\u2013 Incorporate extended waiting periods for network stabilization, regularly revalidate spatial coordinates, and ensure inventory updates occur prior to connectivity operations to minimize recurring errors in forced connection attempts."}
