Verify that the fluid_system referenced is correctly assigned and present within the connection radius.\n- Uniform Fluid_System Assignment:\n  - Ensure that all components within the pipeline network\u2014including the boiler, offshore pump, and pipe groups\u2014share an identical fluid_system. Mismatches lead to connection failures.\n- Inventory Attribute Consistency:\n  - Use only supported inventory attributes consistently when accessing or modifying inventory items to prevent attribute-related errors."}
