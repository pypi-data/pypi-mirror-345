{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-29.5, 30.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position -29.5, 30.5), boiler (position -24.5, -50.0), and offshore pump (position -10.5, 25.5). The steam engine is currently not connected to the power network and has no input liquid.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(-18.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position -18.0, -49.0) and a furnace (position -18.0, -49.0)\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine (position not specified) and inserter (position not specified) that puts into the assembling machine\n- Beltgroup (position not specified) that connects the furnace at position -18.0, -49.0 to the assembling machine\n\n### Labs\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab (position not specified) with no power\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to electricity connections\n- Ensure that all electric poles are properly connected to the power network to avoid \"not connected to power network\" errors. Check the status of nearby electric poles and their connections.\n\n### Errors when using attributes of entities\n- Avoid accessing attributes that do not exist for certain entity types, such as 'voltage' for the ElectricityGroup. Always verify the available attributes for an entity before attempting to access them.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing. Check for existing entities in the target position.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items."}
