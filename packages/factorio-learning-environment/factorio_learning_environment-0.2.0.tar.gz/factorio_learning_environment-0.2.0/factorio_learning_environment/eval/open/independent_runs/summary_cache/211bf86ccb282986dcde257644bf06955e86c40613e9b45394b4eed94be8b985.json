Adjust spacing, direction, or reference positions and verify that the target tile is unoccupied before placement.\n\u2022 Reconfiguration Overlaps \u2013 Successive reconfigurations require complete removal of interfering or residual entities from previous setups to avoid alignment errors.\n\u2022 Fuel Supply Shortages \u2013 Attempts to fuel burner inserters sometimes failed due to insufficient coal. Ensure adequate fuel is available in inventory prior to fueling transfer components.\n\u2022 Inventory Insertion Control \u2013 Insertion failures occur when the required resources are not available. Confirm inventory contents before inserting items."}
