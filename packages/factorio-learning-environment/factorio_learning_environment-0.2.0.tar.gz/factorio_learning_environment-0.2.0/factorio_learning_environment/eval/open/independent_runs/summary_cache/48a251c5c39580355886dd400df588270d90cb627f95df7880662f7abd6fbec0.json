{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0): Used for smelting iron ore into iron plates. Currently fueled with coal.\n- **Burner Inserter 1** at position (1.5, 0.5): Transfers iron plates from the furnace to a wooden chest. Pickup position is (0.5, 0.5) and drop position is (2.5, 0.5).\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (2.5, 0.5): Stores iron plates transferred by Burner Inserter 1.\n- **Burner Inserter 2** at position (3.5, 0.5): Extracts items from the wooden chest and places them onto a transport belt. Pickup position is (2.5, 0.5) and drop position is (4.5, 0.5).\n- **Transport Belt**: Connects the wooden chest to the second burner inserter and further to another wooden chest. \n  - BeltGroup includes:\n    - Belt from (3.5, 0.5) to (5.5, 0.5) in the direction RIGHT.\n    - Belt from (4.5, 0.5) to (6.5, 0.5) in the direction RIGHT.\n- **Burner Inserter 3** at position (6.5, 0.5): Transfers iron plates from the transport belt to the end wooden chest. Pickup position is (5.5, 0.5) and drop position is (7.5, 0.5).\n- **End Wooden Chest** at position (7.5, 0.5): Collects iron plates from the transport belt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied positions\n- Ensure there is enough space and the position is unoccupied before placing an entity. Consider increasing spacing, changing direction, or adjusting the reference position.\n\n### Errors when connecting belts directly from a chest\n- Use an inserter to extract items from a chest before attempting to connect it to a transport belt.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient inventory items\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to place or craft entities. Gather raw resources like wood before crafting items that require them.\n\n### Errors when crafting without required sub-ingredients\n- Gather all necessary raw resources before attempting to craft items that depend on them. For example, gather wood before crafting a wooden chest."}
