{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Smelting Line at y=0\nConsists of two furnaces for smelting iron plates:\n- Stone furnace at (0.0, 0.0)\n- Stone furnace at (2.0, 0.0)\n\n### Research Lab Setup at y=0\n- Lab at (8.5, 0.5) loaded with automation science packs\n\n### Mixed Smelting Line at y=4\nConsists of six furnaces:\n- Copper smelting furnaces:\n  - Stone furnace at (0.0, 4.0)\n  - Stone furnace at (2.0, 4.0)\n- Iron smelting furnaces:\n  - Stone furnace at (4.0, 4.0)\n  - Stone furnace at (6.0, 4.0)\n\n### Power Generation Setup\nPartially constructed power generation system:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Boiler at (-9.5, 23.0)\n- Steam engine at (-9.5, 19.5)\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Errors\n- When placing steam engines, ensure there is solid ground and no water or other entities blocking the placement\n- Check terrain compatibility before placing structures\n\n### Resource Management Errors\n- Ensure required materials are in inventory before attempting to insert into furnaces\n- Keep track of iron ore and copper ore levels to maintain continuous smelting\n\n### Crafting Dependencies\n- When crafting complex items like labs, ensure all prerequisite items and sub-components can be crafted first\n- For automation science packs, ensure copper plates are available through proper smelting setup\n\n### Power System Connection Errors\n- Entities need to be properly connected using appropriate connection items (pipes)\n- Ensure correct positioning and alignment of power system components\n- Power generating entities must form a complete chain (pump -> boiler -> steam engine)\n\n### API Usage Errors\n- Building box dimensions calculation needs proper type handling\n- When connecting entities, ensure proper prototype specification and valid connection points"}
