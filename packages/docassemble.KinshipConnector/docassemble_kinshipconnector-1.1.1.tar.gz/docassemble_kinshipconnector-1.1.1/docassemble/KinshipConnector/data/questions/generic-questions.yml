  #### Introduction

  # Welcome to the Kinship Connector
subquestion: |
  ## Who can use this tool?
  <p class="flex center">[FILE icon-kinship-caregivers.png, 50px] <span>This tool is meant to be used by kinship caregivers, like grandparents or relatives caring for children in their family.</span></p>

  <p class="flex center">[FILE questionnaire.png, 50px] <span>It can give kinship caregivers information and help with filling out forms for different legal options for formalizing custody of children.  Kinship caregivers can fill out these forms after they are already caring for the children or in anticipation of needing to care for them. <br><br>This tool is not meant to help when the children are involved in an abuse and neglect case in court.</span></p>

  ## What to expect
  <p class="flex center">[FILE icon-time.png, 50px]<span>Depending on the type of form this will take between 10 and 25 minutes.</span></p>

  <p class="flex center">[FILE icon-cost.png, 50px]<span>This tool is free but you may need to pay to file the forms with the court.</span></p>

  ## What do you need?
  <p class="flex center">[FILE diy.png, 50px]<span>Depending on the type of form, you will need to know names, birthdates, and addresses for children and parents.  Also, knowing any court history such as dates and locations is important.</span></p>

ga id: noCourt
question: |
  Are there reasons to **not** go to court?
subquestion: |
  Some caregivers may have concerns about going to court, 
  either because they do not want to go before a judge or
  because they do not want allegations made against their biological
  family.
fields:
  - no label: court
    datatype: yesnomaybe
  - Could you describe why?: no_court_reason

      - I am scared of judges and lawyers: scared
      - I do not want to get someone in trouble: trouble

      is: True
  - note: |
      <div class="helper-wrapper" id="temporaryCareHelper"><div class="helper-body">Not going to court limits the options available to kinship caregivers.  Temporary Care Agreements are the only option available in this tool that does not require going to court.</div></div>

ga id: decisionMaking
question: |
  Who will make decisions for the children?
subquestion: |
  Caregivers are often responsible for children without being told
  what decisions they can or cannot make.

  It is important to make sure everyone is aware who is going to make
  decisions.
fields:
  - no label: decision
    datatype: radio
    choices:
      - I need to be able to make decisions: applicant
      - The biological parent(s) will continue making long-term decisions: parent

  - note: |
      <div class="helper-wrapper" id="adoptionHelper"><div class="helper-body">While all three document options allow caregivers to make choices for the children, Guardianship and Adoption are the two that provide the most authority for caregivers.</div></div>

      variable: decision

  - note: |
      <div class="helper-wrapper" id="temporaryCareHelper"><div class="helper-body">Parents keeping long term decision-making often means that they are going to want to have the children back again.

ga id: bioContact
question: |
  Will the biological parent(s) remain in contact with the children?
subquestion: |
  Some situations allow for children to remain in contact with their
  biological parent(s) while other situations mean that the parent(s) will
  need to be kept away.  
fields:
  - no label: bio_contact
    datatype: radio
    choices:
      - Normal Interactions: normal
        help: |
          Biological family can come and go, see the children
          like normal.  As caregiver you are just helping out the
          family.
      - Limited Interactions: limited
        help: |
          Contact might be limited because a biological family
          member is incarcerated or because it could be harmful
          to the children if the family member is around, but
          the parent could be working to improve the situation.
      - No Interactions: no_contact
        help: |
          Biological family cannot have any contact with the children
          and all interactions will be with the caregivers.
      - I don't know: none
  - note: |
      <div class="helper-wrapper" id="temporaryCareHelper"><div class="helper-body">Regular contact with biological parents usually only happens when the kinship caregivers and biological parents are in agreement with the situation.  This often means a Temporary Care Agreement where everyone is working together to care for the children.  Sometimes this also happens with Guardianship</div></div>
    show if:
      variable: bio_contact
      is: normal
  - note: |
      <div class="helper-wrapper" id="guardianshipHelper"><div class="helper-body">Limited contact means that the children can continue to know and get updates from their parents while in the care of someone else.  Usually, this is because the ultimate plan is to have the children return to their biological parents in the future, like in a Guardianship.  There is no requirement, however, that there is an exact plan or timeframe for the children to return to their biological parents.</div></div>
    show if:
      variable: bio_contact
      is: limited
  - note: |
      <div class="helper-wrapper" id="adoptionHelper"><div class="helper-body">Because Adoption replaces the biological parents on the children's birth certificates, it is the best way to ensure that biological family has no contact with the children.  This is because the kinship caregiver, as the new parents, have complete control as though they were the birth parents.</div></div>

ga id: needBenefits
question: |
  Do you need assistance caring for the children?
subquestion: |
  Caregivers are often eligible for benefits and assistance to care 
  for the children.  However, eligibility and the level of assistance
  can be based on how the children came into your care.
fields:
  - no label: benefits_need
    datatype: radio
    choices:
      - I need to get benefits or assistance: get_assistance
      - I do not need assistance: no_assistance

  - note: |
      <div class="helper-wrapper" id="adoptionHelper"><div class="helper-body">Eligibility for public benefits (like Medicaid, Food Stamps, or other cash assistance) for kinship care situations is complex.  It can depend on the caregiver's income or on the parent's income, and on the type of relationship that is in place.  Consider looking at the information available at the link to the right.  If these benefits or assistance are important to you and the children, you should <a href="https://legalaidwv.org/get-help/apply-for-help/">seek legal help</a>, especially before filing for adoption.  Benefits that might have been available when the children were under temporary care or Guardianship will often end or will not be an option after adoption.</div></div>
