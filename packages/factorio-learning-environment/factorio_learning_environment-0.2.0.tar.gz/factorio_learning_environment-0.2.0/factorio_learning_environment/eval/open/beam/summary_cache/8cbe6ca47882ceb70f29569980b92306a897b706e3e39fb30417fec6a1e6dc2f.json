{"content": "Ah, now I understand the core issue! We can't craft iron gear wheels directly because they need iron plates, and iron plates must be smelted in a furnace first. Let's work with what we already have placed:\n\n1. Find an existing furnace\n2. Get it working to produce iron plates\n3. Then we can craft the items we need\n\n```python\n# Check our inventory and existing entities\ninventory = inspect_inventory()\nprint(f\"Current inventory: {inventory}\")\n\n# Find existing furnaces\nentities = get_entities()\nprint(\"Looking for existing furnaces...\")\n\nfor entity in entities:\n    if isinstance(entity, Furnace):\n        print(f\"Found furnace at {entity.position}\")\n        \n        # Move to furnace and add fuel if needed\n        move_to(entity.position)\n        if 'coal' not in entity.fuel or entity.fuel['coal'] < 5:\n            insert_item(Prototype.Coal, entity, quantity=5)\n            print(f\"Added fuel to furnace at {entity.position}\")\n\n# Find nearby inserters\nfor entity in entities:\n    if isinstance(entity, BurnerInserter):\n        print(f\"Found inserter at {entity.position}\")\n        \n        # Add fuel to inserter if needed\n        move_to(entity.position)\n        if 'coal' not in entity.fuel or entity.fuel['coal'] < 5:\n            insert_item(Prototype.Coal, entity, quantity=5)\n            print(f\"Added fuel to inserter at {entity.position}\")\n\n# Get our source chest with iron ore\nchest = get_entity(Prototype.IronChest, Position(x=-15.5, y=21.5))\nprint(f\"Source chest contains: {chest.inventory}\")\n\n# Connect chest to nearest furnace input inserter with transport belts\n# Find closest input inserter to chest\nclosest_inserter = None\nmin_distance = float('inf')\n\nfor entity in entities:\n    if isinstance(entity, BurnerInserter):\n        distance = abs(entity.position.x - chest.position.x) + abs(entity.position.y - chest.position.y)\n        if distance < min_distance:\n            min_distance = distance\n            closest_inserter = entity\n\nif closest_inserter:\n    print(f\"Connecting chest to closest inserter at {closest_inserter.position}\")\n    belts = connect_entities(\n        chest.position,\n        closest_inserter.pickup_position,\n        Prototype.TransportBelt\n    )\n    print(\"Added transport belts from chest to inserter\")\n\n# Verify our setup\nprint(f\"Final inventory: {inspect_inventory()}\")\nprint(\"Setup complete - furnace should now produce iron plates\")\n```\n\nThis approach:\n1. Works with existing furnaces rather than trying to place new ones\n2. Ensures all machines have fuel\n3. Connects the iron ore source to the furnace system\n4. Should start producing iron plates that we can then use to craft gear wheels and inserters", "summary_range": "[1-1408]"}
