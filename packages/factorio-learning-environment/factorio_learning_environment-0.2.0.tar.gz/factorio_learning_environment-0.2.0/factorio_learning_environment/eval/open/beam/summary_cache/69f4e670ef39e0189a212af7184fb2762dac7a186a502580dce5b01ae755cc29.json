It has 4 pieces of coal left as fuel and is currently in the \"WORKING\" status.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Monitor the Furnace**: I will continue to monitor the furnace as it processes the remaining copper ore. Once it finishes, I can extract any additional copper plates produced.\n2. **Plan for Crafting**: With the copper plates and other materials, I can start planning for the crafting of Electronic Circuits and eventually the Lab.\n\nLet\u2019s wait for the furnace to finish processing the remaining copper ore.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Allow some time for the furnace to smelt the remaining copper ore into copper plates.\nsleep(10)  # Allow time for the smelting process to take place\n\n# After waiting, check the output inventory of the furnace\nfinal_furnace_inventory_after_processing = inspect_inventory(new_furnace)\nprint(f\"Final furnace inventory after waiting: {final_furnace_inventory_after_processing}\")  # Check how many copper plates or ore are processed\nprint(f\"Current overall inventory after waiting: {inspect_inventory()}\")  # Current overall inventory again\nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")  # Verify entity states.", "summary_range": "[1-198]"}
