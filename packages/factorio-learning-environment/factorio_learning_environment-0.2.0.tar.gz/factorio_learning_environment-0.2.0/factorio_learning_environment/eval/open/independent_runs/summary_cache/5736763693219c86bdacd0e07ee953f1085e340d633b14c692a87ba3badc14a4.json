{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (1.0, 1.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (3.0, 1.0)\n\nThese furnaces are used for smelting copper ore into copper plates. Currently, they are out of fuel and have copper ore loaded in them.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Crafting Copper Cables\n- Ensure that you have the required copper plates before attempting to craft copper cables. Copper plates need to be smelted in a furnace from copper ore. Make sure the furnaces are fueled and operational to produce copper plates.\n\n### Errors when Furnaces are Out of Fuel\n- Regularly check the fuel status of your furnaces. Ensure they are adequately supplied with coal or another fuel source to maintain continuous operation."}
