{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron ore mining and smelting structure at position around (17.5, 72.5)\nConsists of the following connected entities:\n- Electric mining drill at position (17.5, 72.5) facing down, powered but still reporting output blockage due to furnace belt congestion.\n- Stone furnace at position (18.0, 75.0) fueled with coal and operational, frequently smelting iron ore but output inventory often full.\n- Three wooden chests at positions (19.5, 75.5), (21.5, 75.5), and (21.5, 77.5) used for staged storage of iron plates.\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5) and (20.5, 77.5) fueled and operational, transferring items between furnace and chests.\n- Small electric pole at (15.5, 75.5) and newly placed poles at (17.5, 72.5) and (18.0, 75.0) connecting this structure to the power network.\n\nThis structure enables iron ore extraction, smelting, and storage with improved power connectivity and inserter fueling. Output belt blockage remains an issue to address.\n\n### Steam power generation structure at position around (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, -0.5) extracting water.\n- Boiler at position (-5.0, 2.5), currently out of fuel and not working.\n- Steam engine at position (0.5, 6.5), connected by pipes to boiler, operational and generating power.\n- Small electric poles near boiler (-4.5, -0.5), steam engine (0.5, 3.5), and newly placed pole at (0.5, 6.5) forming a connected power network.\n\nThis structure reliably generates electricity from steam power but requires refueling of the boiler to maintain operation.\n\n### Iron gear wheel assembly structure at position around (25.5, 80.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine 2 at (25.5, 80.5), powered and actively crafting iron gear wheels.\n- Input wooden chest at (21.5, 75.5) feeding iron plates into assembly area.\n- Output wooden chest at (25.5, 82.5) currently empty.\n- Burner inserter at (25.5, 83.5) fueled and operational, moving assembled items into output chest.\n- Small electric pole at (25.5, 80.5) connected to power network.\n\nThis structure is now fully powered and supplied with iron plates, enabling active production of iron gear wheels, though output chest remains empty indicating possible extraction or transfer issues.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Persistent output blockage at furnace output belt\n- The electric mining drill at (17.5, 72.5) still reports \"furnace belt at drop position is blocked,\" causing output stoppage.\n- Stone furnace output inventory frequently full, preventing further smelting.\n- To resolve, clear or extend output belts and chests to accept smelted iron plates and ensure continuous flow.\n- Regularly monitor belt and chest capacities to avoid bottlenecks.\n\n### Boiler fuel management and operation\n- Boiler at (-5.0, 2.5) is currently out of fuel and not working, reducing steam power generation.\n- Ensure continuous insertion of coal or other fuel into the boiler to maintain steam production.\n- Consider automated fuel supply to boiler to prevent downtime.\n\n### Electric pole placement conflicts and power network expansion\n- Attempts to place small electric poles near furnace at (18.0, 75.0) failed due to tile occupancy and proximity to mining drill at (17.5, 72.5).\n- To avoid placement conflicts, verify tile availability before placing poles and adjust spacing or direction.\n- Newly placed poles at (0.5, 6.5), (17.5, 72.5), and (25.5, 80.5) successfully expanded the power network.\n\n### Inserter fuel and inventory management\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5), (20.5, 77.5), and (25.5, 83.5) consistently fueled and operational.\n- Inserters occasionally wait for source items, indicating temporary input shortages.\n- Maintain steady supply of fuel and source items to prevent inserter stoppages.\n\n### Assembling machine input and output handling\n- Assembling machine at (25.5, 80.5) now receives iron plates and produces iron gear wheels actively.\n- Output chest at (25.5, 82.5) remains empty, and burner inserter at (25.5, 83.5) is waiting for source items, suggesting output extraction issues.\n- Ensure output inserter is correctly positioned and powered to transfer assembled"}
