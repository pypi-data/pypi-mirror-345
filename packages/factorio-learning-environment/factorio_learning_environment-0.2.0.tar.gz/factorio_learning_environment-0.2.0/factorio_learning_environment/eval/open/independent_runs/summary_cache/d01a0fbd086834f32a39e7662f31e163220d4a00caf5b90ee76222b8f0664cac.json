{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at Position (x=17.5, y=20.5), operational with energy output of 15000.0.\n- Boiler at Position (x=1.5, y=23.0), fueled with coal, operational with energy output of 2000.0.\n- Offshore Pump at Position (x=-9.5, y=24.5), operational, supplying water.\n- Pipe Group (steam) connecting various positions from (x=3.5, y=17.5) to (x=10.5, y=21.5).\n- Pipe Group (water) connecting various positions from (x=-9.5, y=23.5) to (x=-0.5, y=23.5).\n- Electricity Group with poles at various positions, providing electrical connectivity.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors when Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure that the pipe connections are correctly aligned and within reach of the intended target. Double-check the positions of both the starting and ending points of the connection to avoid failed connections.\n\n### Errors when Using Extracting but Being Too Far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when Placing into a Tile Which is Occupied by Another Entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
