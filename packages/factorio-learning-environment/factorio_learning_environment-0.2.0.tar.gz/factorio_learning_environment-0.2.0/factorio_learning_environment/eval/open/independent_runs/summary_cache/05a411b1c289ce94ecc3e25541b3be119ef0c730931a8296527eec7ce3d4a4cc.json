Verify the entity's position and contents before attempting extraction.\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities on Occupied Tiles\n- Before placing a new entity, check if the target tile is occupied by another entity. Consider adjusting the spacing, changing the direction, or selecting a different reference position to avoid collisions.\n\n### Errors due to Full Inventory at Drop Positions\n- Regularly check and clear the inventory of chests at drop positions to prevent mining or production interruptions. Ensure that there is sufficient space for new items to be deposited.\n\n### Errors when Repositioning Inserters\n- When repositioning inserters, ensure they are correctly aligned with both the source and destination entities. Verify that the inserter's pickup and drop positions are correctly set to facilitate smooth item transfer."}
