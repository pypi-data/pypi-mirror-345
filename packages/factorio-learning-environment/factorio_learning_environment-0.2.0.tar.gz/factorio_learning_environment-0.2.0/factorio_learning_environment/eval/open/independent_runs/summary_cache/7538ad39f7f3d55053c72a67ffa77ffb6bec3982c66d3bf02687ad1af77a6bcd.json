{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position x=53.0, y=-83.0) extracting coal, connected to a Wooden Chest (position x=52.5, y=-84.5) for storage.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage Facility at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position x=-14.0, y=-53.0) extracting iron ore, connected to a Wooden Chest (position x=-14.5, y=-54.5) for storage.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace (position x=0.0, y=0.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates, connected to a Wooden Chest (position x=1.5, y=0.5) for storing iron plates and coal.\n- Burner Inserter (position x=2.5, y=0.5) transferring items between chests.\n\n### Copper Ore Processing Facility at Position (-25.0, -64.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position x=-25.0, y=-64.0) extracting copper ore, connected to a series of BeltGroups for transporting materials.\n- Stone Furnace (position x=-22.0, y=-67.0) for smelting copper ore, currently not operational due to lack of ingredients.\n\n### Iron Plate Processing Facility at Position (-19.0, -65.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace (position x=-19.0, y=-65.0) for smelting iron ore, currently not operational due to lack of ingredients.\n- Burner Inserter (position x=-17.5, y=-64.5) transferring items between the furnace and a Wooden Chest (position x=-16.5, y=-64.5).\n\n### Belt Transport System\nConsists of multiple BeltGroups facilitating the movement of materials between various entities:\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (x=-26.5, y=-65.5) to (x=-22.5, y=-65.5), (x=-23.5, y=-64.5) to (x=-21.5, y=-64.5), and others.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities where space is occupied\n- Ensure the target location is clear before placing an entity. Attempting to place a burner-inserter at position (-23.0, -67.0) failed due to obstruction.\n\n### Errors related to furnace operation\n- Ensure furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. The furnace at position (-22.0, -67.0) is not operational due to a lack of ingredients.\n- Verify that the furnace status is working. An assertion error occurred because the furnace was not functioning properly.\n\n### Errors when placing inserters without clear positions\n- Identify and secure a clear position for placing inserters to avoid placement errors."}
