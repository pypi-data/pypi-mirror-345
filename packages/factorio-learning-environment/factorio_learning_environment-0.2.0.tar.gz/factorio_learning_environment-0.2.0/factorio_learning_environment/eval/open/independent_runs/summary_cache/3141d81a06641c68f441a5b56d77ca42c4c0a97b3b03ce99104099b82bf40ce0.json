{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron ore mine at position (-15.5, -50.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (-15.0, -50.0)\n\n### Wooden chest at position (41.5, -80.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -80.5) with an inventory containing coal.\n\n### Burner mining drill at position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) with coal as fuel and is currently working.\n\n### Stone furnace at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -50.0) currently has coal as fuel but is not working due to no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n- **Errors when extracting from the wooden chest with insufficient inventory**\n  - Ensure that the wooden chest has enough coal before attempting to extract. The inventory was often at low levels, leading to repeated extraction attempts without sufficient resources.\n\n- **Errors when inserting coal into the mining drill**\n  - Confirm that the mining drill is ready to be refueled and that there is sufficient coal in the inventory before inserting. The drill was successfully refueled, but ensure to monitor coal levels.\n\n- **Errors when the furnace has no ingredients to smelt**\n  - Ensure that the furnace has the necessary ingredients to operate. The furnace at position (-15.0, -50.0) reported no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions**\n  - No specific utility functions have been defined or invoked as per the execution logs.\n\n- **Important Variables**\n  - `wood`: int\n  - `coal`: int\n  - `iron-ore`: int\n  - `iron-plate`: int\n  - `wooden-chest`: object\n  - `burner-mining-drill`: object\n  - `stone-furnace`: object"}
