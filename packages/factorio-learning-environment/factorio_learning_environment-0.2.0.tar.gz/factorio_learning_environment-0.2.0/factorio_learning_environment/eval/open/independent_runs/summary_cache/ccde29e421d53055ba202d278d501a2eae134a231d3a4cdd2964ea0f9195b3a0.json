This could be due to several reasons:\n  - The chest might not contain the item being extracted.\n  - The agent might be trying to extract more items than available in the chest.\n  - The agent might not be close enough to the chest to perform the extraction.\n  - The agent's inventory might be full, preventing it from receiving the extracted items.\n  - The chest might be full, preventing items from being extracted.\n  \n  To mitigate these errors, ensure that:\n  - The chest contains the item to be extracted.\n  - The extraction quantity does not exceed the available quantity in the chest.\n  - The agent is within the interaction range of the chest.\n  - The agent's inventory has enough space to receive the extracted items.\n  - The chest has enough space to receive the extracted items.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n```"}
