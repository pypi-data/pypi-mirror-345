{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron ore mining and smelting structure at position around (17.5, 72.5)\nConsists of the following connected entities:\n- Electric mining drill at position (17.5, 72.5) facing down, powered but output blocked due to furnace belt blockage.\n- Stone furnace at position (18.0, 75.0) fueled with coal and working, though furnace source inventory is frequently full.\n- Three wooden chests at positions (19.5, 75.5), (21.5, 75.5), and (21.5, 77.5), used for staged storage of iron plates.\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5) and (20.5, 77.5), fueled and operational, transferring iron plates between furnace and chests.\n- Small electric pole at (15.5, 75.5) connected to power network.\n- Persistent output blockage warning at furnace belt drop position affecting mining drill operation remains unresolved.\n\nThis structure enables iron ore extraction, smelting, and intermediate storage with improved power and inserter fueling, but output belt blockage continues to limit throughput.\n\n### Steam power generation structure at position around (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, -0.5) extracting water.\n- Boiler at (-5.0, 2.5) fueled with coal, currently working but recently reported out of fuel.\n- Steam engine at (0.5, 6.5) connected to boiler by pipes, generating power.\n- Small electric poles placed near boiler (-4.5, -0.5), steam engine (0.5, 3.5), and newly added poles at (0.5, 6.5), (17.5, 72.5), and (25.5, 80.5), forming a connected power network.\n\nThis structure reliably generates electricity from steam power, supplying the factory\u2019s electric network, though boiler fuel management needs attention.\n\n### Iron gear wheel assembly structure at position around (25.5, 80.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine 2 at (25.5, 80.5), powered and connected to small electric pole at (25.5, 80.5).\n- Input wooden chest at (21.5, 75.5) supplying iron plates.\n- Output wooden chest at (25.5, 82.5) receiving assembled iron gear wheels.\n- Burner inserter at (25.5, 83.5), fueled and operational, moving items into output chest.\n- Inserters and chests actively transferring iron plates and gear wheels, though assembling machine input inventory fluctuates between empty and stocked states.\n\nThis structure is functional for iron gear wheel production with power and inserter setup, but input supply and output clearing require continuous management.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Persistent output blockage at furnace belt drop position\n- The electric mining drill at (17.5, 72.5) remains blocked due to full furnace output belt.\n- Furnace output inventory frequently full, preventing further smelting output.\n- To mitigate, extend or clear output belts and chests downstream to ensure continuous item flow and prevent backups.\n\n### Entity placement conflicts due to occupied tiles\n- Failed attempts to place small electric poles near (18.0, 75.0) due to collisions with mining drill at (17.5, 72.5) or water tiles.\n- To avoid, verify tile occupancy before placement, increase spacing, adjust pole direction, or select alternative nearby positions.\n\n### Inserter inventory and fuel management\n- Burner inserters at (20.5, 75.5), (20.5, 77.5), and (25.5, 83.5) consistently fueled and operational.\n- Occasional inserter waiting for source items status observed, indicating temporary input shortages.\n- Maintain steady fuel supply and monitor inserter inventories to prevent stoppages.\n\n### Crafting and recipe dependency errors\n- Assembling machine 2 input inventory fluctuates; sometimes empty despite iron plates being available in input chest.\n- Occasional failure to insert iron plates into assembling machine due to no nearby entity accepting items.\n- Ensure clear and direct inserter connections between input chest and assembling machine.\n- Keep output chests clear to allow assembling machine to output crafted items and continue production.\n\n### Boiler fuel management\n- Boiler at (-5.0, 2.5) reported out of fuel status recently, causing temporary power generation halt.\n- Regularly insert coal into boiler to maintain continuous steam production and stable power supply.\n\n### Item insertion failures due to lack of valid target entities\n- Error when attempting to insert iron plates into entities with no valid receivers nearby.\n- Before inserting items, confirm presence of valid target entities that can accept the item type.\n- Implement checks for entity availability and inventory space to avoid insertion exceptions.\n\n"}
