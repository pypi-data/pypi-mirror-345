{"content": "# The attempt to connect the burner inserter to the wooden chest failed because there are no transport belts available in the inventory. \n# This means we cannot create a direct connection between the inserter and the chest, which is likely contributing to the `WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION` status.\n\n### Next Steps:\n\n1. **Gather Transport Belts**: We need to either craft or gather transport belts to facilitate the connection between the burner inserter and the wooden chest.\n\n2. **Craft Transport Belts**: If we have the necessary resources (iron plates and wood), we can craft transport belts using the assembling machine.\n\n3. **Check Inventory**: Let's first check if we have enough resources to craft transport belts.\n\n#### Step 1: Check Inventory for Resources\ncurrent_inventory = inspect_inventory()\nprint(f\"Current inventory: {current_inventory}\")\n\n# Step 2: If we have enough resources, let's craft transport belts.\nif current_inventory.get('iron-plate', 0) >= 1 and current_inventory.get('wood', 0) >= 1:\n    craft_item(Prototype.TransportBelt, quantity=3)  # Craft 3 transport belts\n    print(\"Crafted 3 transport belts.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Not enough resources to craft transport belts.\")\n\n# Step 3: After crafting, check the inventory again to confirm the addition of transport belts.\ncurrent_inventory = inspect_inventory()\nprint(f\"Updated inventory after crafting: {current_inventory}\")\n\n# Step 4: If we successfully crafted transport belts, proceed to connect the burner inserter to the wooden chest.\nif current_inventory.get('transport-belt', 0) >= 3:\n    connect_entities(Position(x=-19.5, y=20.5), Position(x=-20.0, y=19.0), Prototype.TransportBelt)\n    print(\"Connected burner inserter to wooden chest with transport belts.\")\nelse:\n    print(\"Unable to connect; not enough transport belts available.\")", "summary_range": "[1-2298]"}
