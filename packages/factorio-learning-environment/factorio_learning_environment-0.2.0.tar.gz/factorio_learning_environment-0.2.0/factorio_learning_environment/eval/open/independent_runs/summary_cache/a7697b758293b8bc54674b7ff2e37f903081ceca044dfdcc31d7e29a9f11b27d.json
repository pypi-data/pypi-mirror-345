{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll generate a report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n###Coal Mining and Storage System (around position 41,-82)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (41.0, -82.0) mining coal\n- Two iron chests for coal storage (41.5, -84.5) and (41.5, -83.5), both full with 1600 coal each\n- Wooden chest for temporary coal storage (41.5, -80.5) containing 684 coal\n\n###Incomplete Coal Transport System (around position 42,-80)\nConsists of:\n- Belt group with two transport belts (42.5, -80.5) and (43.5, -80.5)\n- Burner inserter (42.5, -79.5) connecting wooden chest to transport belt\n\n###Iron Smelting Setup (around position 45,-81)\nConsists of:\n- Two stone furnaces (45.0, -81.0) and (47.0, -81.0), both fueled but idle\n- Wooden chest for iron plate storage (49.5, -80.5) containing 1500 iron plates\n\nERROR TIPS\n1. Inserter Placement Errors\n   - Ensure target position for inserter placement is clear of other entities\n   - Multiple failed attempts to place inserter at (44.0, -81.0), (44.0, -82.0), (41.5, -80.5), and (44.5, -81.0)\n   - Check surrounding area for conflicting entities before placement\n\n2. Belt Connection Errors\n   - Cannot connect belts directly to chests or furnaces\n   - Must use inserters as intermediaries between belts and buildings\n   - Always use inserters when moving items between storage/processing buildings and belts\n\n3. Entity Connection Logic\n   - Plan the complete material flow before building\n   - Ensure proper use of inserters between different entity types\n   - Follow pattern: Storage -> Inserter -> Belt -> Inserter -> Processing building\n\nNAMESPACE\nFunctions:\n- place_entity(): Places entities on the map. Fails when target location is occupied.\n- connect_entities(): Creates belt connections between entities. Fails when trying to connect incompatible entities directly.\n\nImportant Variables:\n- furnace_inserter (BurnerInserter): Used for placing inserters near furnaces\n- belt_group (BeltGroup): Represents connected transport belt segments\n- chest_inserter (BurnerInserter): Used for inserters near chests"}
