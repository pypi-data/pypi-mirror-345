{"content": "Here is the updated report based on the execution logs:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing Setup (around x=41-44, y=-80 to -82)\nComplex setup consisting of:\n- Burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0) mining coal\n- Wooden chest at (41.5, -80.5) collecting coal from the drill\n- Burner inserter at (42.5, -80.5) transferring coal from chest to furnace\n- Stone furnace at (44.0, -81.0)\n\nThe structure forms a coal production line where:\n1. Mining drill extracts coal and outputs to chest\n2. Inserter moves coal from chest to furnace\n3. All components are fueled with coal and operational\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement and Alignment Issues\n- When placing entities that interact (like inserters and furnaces), ensure proper alignment between pickup/drop positions\n- Account for entity sizes when placing - furnaces are 2x2 while inserters are 1x1\n- Clear any items on ground that may block entity placement\n- Use place_entity_next_to with appropriate spacing parameters to avoid collisions\n\n### Entity Collision Prevention\n- Check for existing entities before placement to avoid overlap\n- Consider the full footprint of larger entities like furnaces (2x2)\n- Use proper spacing when placing entities next to each other\n- Verify terrain is suitable for placement (not water)\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nFunctions:\n- place_entity_next_to(entity_type, reference_pos, spacing, direction) -> Returns: Entity\n  Success: Places entity properly aligned with reference\n  Failure: When collision detected or invalid placement position\n\nVariables:\n- furnace: Entity (stone-furnace)\n- inserter: Entity (burner-inserter)\n- mining_drill: Entity (burner-mining-drill)\n- chest: Entity (wooden-chest)"}
