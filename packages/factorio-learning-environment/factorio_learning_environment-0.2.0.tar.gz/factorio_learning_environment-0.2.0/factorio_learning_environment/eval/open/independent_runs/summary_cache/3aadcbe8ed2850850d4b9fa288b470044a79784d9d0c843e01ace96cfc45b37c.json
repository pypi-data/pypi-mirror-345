{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) connected to a wooden chest at position (52.5, -84.5) and another chest at (54.5, -84.5) for coal storage.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining Facility at Position (-23.0, -68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) connected to a wooden chest at position (-23.5, -69.5) and another chest at (-24.5, -67.5) for copper ore storage.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) connected to a wooden chest at position (-14.5, -54.5).\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5) moving items from the chest to another chest at (-12.5, -54.5).\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -70.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Copper Ore Storage Facility\nConsists of multiple wooden chests at positions (0.5, -4.5), (5.5, -4.5), (0.5, -2.5), (0.5, -3.5), (5.5, -2.5), (5.5, -3.5), (0.5, 2.5), (0.5, 3.5), (5.5, 2.5), (5.5, 3.5), (0.5, 4.5), (5.5, 4.5) for copper ore storage.\n\n### Copper Plate Processing Facility at Position (0.0, 0.0) and (5.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) and another at (5.0, 0.0) for smelting copper ore into copper plates.\n\n### Belt System\nConsists of the following belt groups:\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (1.5, 1.5) to (3.5, 1.5) and (2.5, 1.5) to (4.5, 1.5).\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (3.5, 2.5) to (5.5, 2.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### TypeError: 'Chest' object is not callable\n- Ensure that you are using the correct method to interact with entities. The 'pickup_entity' function should be used with the correct entity type, not with a 'Chest' object.\n\n### Errors related to full chests\n- Regularly check the inventory status of chests and empty them if they are full to avoid interruptions in mining and processing operations.\n\n### Errors due to lack of fuel\n- Ensure that all burner mining drills and inserters have an adequate supply of fuel to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Errors due to missing ingredients in furnaces\n- Ensure that furnaces have the required ingredients to process, such as ores for smelting, to avoid idle time."}
