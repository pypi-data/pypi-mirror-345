This indicates a problem with the belt configuration or a lack of space for the ore to move along the belt.\n- Solution: Inspect the belt configuration connected to the drill at x=-14.0 y=-51.0. Ensure there is sufficient space on the belt for the ore to move, and that the belt is connected correctly to the next machine or storage.\n\n### Inserter waiting for source items\n- The plate inserter at x=5.5 y=-59.5 is repeatedly waiting for source items, while the chest at x=4.5 y=-58.5 contains 10 iron plates. This indicates a problem with the inserter's configuration or reach.\n- Solution: Check the inserter at x=5.5 y=-59.5. Ensure it is configured to pick up iron plates from the chest at x=4.5 y=-58.5 and that it is close enough to reach the chest.\n\n### Drill out of fuel\n- The drill at x=-14.0 y=-51.0 ran out of fuel.\n- Solution: Ensure the drill is consistently supplied with fuel (coal). Consider automating fuel delivery.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\nThere are no namespaces to report.\n```"}
