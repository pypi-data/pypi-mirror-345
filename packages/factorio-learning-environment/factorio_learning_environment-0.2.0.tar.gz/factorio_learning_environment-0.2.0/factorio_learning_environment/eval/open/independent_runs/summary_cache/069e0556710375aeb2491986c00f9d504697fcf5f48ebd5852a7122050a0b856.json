{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at Position (x=53.0, y=-83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=53.0, y=-83.0) with a drop position at (x=52.5, y=-84.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=52.5, y=-84.5) containing coal and copper ore\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=54.5, y=-84.5) containing coal\n\n### Copper Ore Mine at Position (x=-23.0, y=-68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-23.0, y=-68.0) with a drop position at (x=-23.5, y=-69.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-23.5, y=-69.5) containing copper ore\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-24.5, y=-67.5) containing iron ore\n\n### Iron Ore Mine at Position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0) with a drop position at (x=-14.5, y=-54.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-54.5) containing iron ore\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-12.5, y=-54.5) containing iron ore and copper plate\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-54.5) with pickup position (x=-13.5, y=-53.5) and drop position (x=-13.5, y=-55.5)\n\n### Copper Smelting Facility at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0) and (x=5.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) and (x=5.0, y=0.0)\n- Multiple Wooden Chests around the furnaces containing copper ore\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=2.5, y=0.5) with pickup position (x=3.5, y=0.5) and drop position (x=1.5, y=0.5)\n\n### Belt Group\n- Belt group connecting positions (x=1.5, y=1.5) to (x=3.5, y=1.5) and (x=3.5, y=2.5) to (x=5.5, y=2.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using pickup_entity with incorrect object\n- Ensure that the correct entity object is passed to the function. Avoid using non-callable objects like 'Chest' as callable.\n\n### Inserter Drop Position Mismatch\n- Verify that the drop position of the inserter aligns with the intended target entity's position to avoid misalignment issues.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placement to avoid conflicts with existing entities."}
