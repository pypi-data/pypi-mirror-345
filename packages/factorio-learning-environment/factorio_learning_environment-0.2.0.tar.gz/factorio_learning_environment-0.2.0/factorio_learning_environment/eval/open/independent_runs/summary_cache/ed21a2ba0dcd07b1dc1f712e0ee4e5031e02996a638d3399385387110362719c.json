{"content": "# FACTORY REPORT\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System at Position(-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position(-9.5, -0.5)\n- Boiler at position(-5.0, 2.5)\n- Steam engine at position(0.5, 6.5)\n- Pipe connections between offshore pump and boiler, and between boiler and steam engine\n- Small electric pole at position(0.5, 8.5) connected to the steam engine\nThe system is operational, with the boiler fueled by coal and producing steam at 165\u00b0C, which powers the steam engine.\n\n### Crude Oil Production System at Position(17.5, 40.5)\nConsists of:\n- Pumpjack at position(17.5, 40.5) extracting from a crude oil patch (299,690 units remaining)\n- Small electric pole at position(15.5, 39.5) connecting the pumpjack to the power grid\n- Five storage tanks in sequence:\n  1. Storage tank at position(23.5, 43.5)\n  2. Storage tank at position(33.5, 47.5)\n  3. Storage tank at position(37.5, 57.5)\n  4. Storage tank at position(47.5, 61.5)\n  5. Storage tank at position(51.5, 71.5)\n- Extensive pipe network connecting the pumpjack to all storage tanks\nThe system is operational and producing approximately 838 units of crude oil per 60 seconds, well above the target of 250 units.\n\n### Electricity Distribution Network\nAn electricity network connecting the steam engine to the pumpjack, with multiple small electric poles spanning from position(0.5, 8.5) to position(15.5, 39.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities in invalid locations\n- When placing a pumpjack at step 2, the agent encountered an error because something was in the way or the terrain was unplaceable. Make sure to check the exact position of resources (like oil patches) and place extractors directly on top of them.\n\n### Errors when accessing non-existent attributes\n- In step 3, the agent tried to access `storage_tank.fluid` which doesn't exist. Use `fluid_box` instead to access fluid information in storage tanks.\n\n### Calculation errors\n- In step 5, the agent calculated \"Total crude oil in storage: 0\" despite the storage tanks containing crude oil. Make sure to correctly sum the amounts from all storage tanks' fluid boxes."}
