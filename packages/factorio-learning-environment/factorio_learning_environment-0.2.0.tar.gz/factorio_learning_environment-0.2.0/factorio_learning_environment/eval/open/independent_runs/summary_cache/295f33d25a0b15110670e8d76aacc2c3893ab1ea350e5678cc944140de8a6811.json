{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) extracting iron ore\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) storing extracted iron ore\n- Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates\n- Burner Inserter at position (-14.5, -46.5) transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing Facility at Position (41.5, -80.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) extracting coal\n- Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -80.5) storing extracted coal\n- Stone Furnace at position (43.0, -82.0) used for smelting operations\n- Burner Inserter at position (43.5, -80.5) transferring items to the furnace\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Insufficient Inventory for Insertion\n- Ensure you have enough items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into a furnace or any other entity. Keep track of your inventory levels to avoid such errors.\n\n### Errors When Attempting to Insert Items into a Full Chest\n- Before inserting items, check if the chest has enough space to accommodate them. If the chest is full, empty it to continue operations smoothly.\n\n### Errors When Entities Are Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that inserters have access to source items by maintaining a steady supply chain. If an inserter is waiting for items, verify the upstream supply and address any bottlenecks."}
