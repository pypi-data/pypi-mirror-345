(Step 1: `NameError: name 'entity' is not defined`, Step 17: `NameError: name 'entity' is not defined`, Step 30: `NameError: name 'to' is not defined`, Step 32: No new errors)\n* Errors when using incorrect operand types:\n  - Check the operand types before performing operations. (Step 4: `TypeError: bad operand type for unary -: 'type'`)\n* Errors when placing entities at occupied or invalid positions:\n  - Ensure the target location is valid and not occupied before placing entities. (Step 5: `Exception: Could not place steam-engine at (-5.5, -0.5), Cannot place steam-engine at the target location - something is in the way or part of the terrain is unplaceable (water)`, Step 6: `Cannot place steam engine at the target location`, Step 8-15: `Cannot place steam engine at the target location`, Step 22: `Exception: Could not place assembling-machine-1 at (15.5, 60.5), No assembling_machine_1 in inventory.`, Step 29: `Exception: Could not place pipe at (1.5, 0.0), Could not find a suitable position to place pipe at the target location, as there is an existing object in the way,`, Step 31: `Exception: Could not place pipe at (2.5, 0.5), Could not find a suitable position to place pipe at the target location, as there is an existing object in the way,`, Step 32: `Exception: Could not place pipe at (1.0, 0.5), Could not find a suitable position to place pipe at the target location, as there is an existing object in the way,`, Step 36: `Exception: Could not place stone-furnace at (17.0, 73.0), Cannot place stone-furnace at the target location - something is in the way or part of the terrain is unplaceable (water)`)\n* Errors when attempting to craft or insert items without sufficient resources:\n  - Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before crafting or inserting. (Step 18: `Exception: Could not insert: No iron-ore to insert from your inventory`, Step 21: `Exception: Could not insert: No iron-ore to insert from your inventory`, Step 23: `Error crafting assembling machine 1: Failed to craft 1x assembling-machine-1 because couldnt craft a required sub-ingredient for assembling-machine-1 - iron-plate`, Step 25: `Exception: Could not insert: No iron-ore to insert from your inventory`, Step 28: `Exception: Could not insert: No iron-ore to insert from your inventory`, Step 39: `Exception: Could not insert: No iron-ore to insert from your inventory`)\n* Errors when connecting entities:\n  - Ensure that the connection points are not blocked and the target is able to receive the fluid or items. (Step 26: `Exception: Did not find any valid connections between source Prototype.Boiler at x=0.5 y=0.0 and target Prototype.SteamEngine at x=4.5 y=0.5`, Step 28: `Exception: Did not find any valid connections between source Prototype.Boiler at x=0.5 y=0.0 and target Prototype.SteamEngine at x=4.5 y=0.5`)\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\nNo utility functions have been"}
