{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo new structures were created or updated in the latest steps. The agent has not built any new entities or modified existing ones.\n\n---\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n1. **Inventory Full Errors**  \n   - The agent repeatedly attempted to craft wooden chests while the inventory was full, leading to failures.  \n   - **Tip:** Always ensure there is sufficient inventory space before attempting to craft items. Drop unnecessary items or use existing storage (e.g., chests) to free up space.\n\n2. **Dropping Items Ineffectively**  \n   - The agent dropped all items in the inventory multiple times but did not resolve the inventory full issue, as it immediately picked up the same items again.  \n   - **Tip:** When dropping items to free up space, ensure they are not immediately picked up again. Use a chest or other storage to permanently store items.\n\n3. **Incorrect Prototype Argument**  \n   - The agent encountered an `AssertionError` indicating the first argument must be a Prototype.  \n   - **Tip:** Verify that the correct prototype type is being passed as an argument when invoking functions or crafting items.\n\n4. **Repeated Crafting Attempts Without Resolution**  \n   - The agent repeatedly attempted to craft wooden chests without addressing the underlying inventory full issue.  \n   - **Tip:** Implement logic to check inventory space and resolve issues (e.g., dropping items or using storage) before retrying crafting.\n\n---\n\n### NAMESPACE\nNo new utility functions or variables were defined or invoked in the latest steps."}
