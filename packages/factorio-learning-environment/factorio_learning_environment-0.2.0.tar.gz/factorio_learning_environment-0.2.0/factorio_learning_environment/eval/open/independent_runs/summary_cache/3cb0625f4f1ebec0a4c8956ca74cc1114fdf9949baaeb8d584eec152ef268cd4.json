{"content": "I'll create a new report based on the execution logs provided:\n\n# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing Setup (around x=41-45, y=-80 to -82)\nComplex automated coal mining and processing setup consisting of:\n- Burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0) mining coal, facing UP\n- Wooden chest at (41.5, -80.5) storing coal output from drill\n- Two burner inserters:\n  - First inserter at (42.5, -80.5) for moving items between chest and belt\n  - Second inserter at (43.5, -80.5) for moving items between belt and furnace\n- Transport belt group connecting components:\n  - Belt at (42.5, -81.5)\n  - Belt at (43.5, -81.5)\n- Stone furnace at (45.0, -81.0)\n\nThe structure is currently operational with:\n- Mining drill working with coal fuel\n- Chest containing coal (>300 units)\n- Both inserters fueled and waiting for items\n- Furnace fully fueled but waiting for ingredients\n- Belt system currently empty\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Belt Direction Access Errors\n- When working with BeltGroup objects, avoid directly accessing .direction attribute\n- BeltGroup is a collection of belts - access individual belt directions through the belts array\n\n### Entity Placement and Configuration\n- Ensure inserter pickup and drop positions are properly aligned with connected entities\n- Verify inserter rotations match the intended material flow direction\n\n# NAMESPACE\n\n### Important Variables\n- None explicitly defined in provided logs\n\n### Functions\n- None explicitly defined in provided logs\n\n### Notable Entity States\n- BurnerMiningDrill: Working state with coal fuel\n- BurnerInserter: WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS state with coal fuel\n- Furnace: NO_INGREDIENTS state with full coal fuel\n- BeltGroup: EMPTY state\n- Chest: NORMAL state with coal inventory"}
