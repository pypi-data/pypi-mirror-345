{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll generate a report summarizing the structures and providing error tips.\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining Setup at position(41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at position(41.0, -82.0) mining coal\n- Transport belt at position(41.5, -80.5) facing RIGHT\n- Burner inserter at position(42.5, -80.5) facing DOWN\n- Stone furnace at position(43.0, -82.0) facing UP\n\nThe structure appears to be a coal mining operation with automated transport, though the positioning and orientation of components seems to be causing operational issues.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Collision Errors\n- Before placing entities, verify the target location is clear of other entities\n- Common error pattern: \"Could not find a suitable position to place [entity] at the target location, as there is an existing object in the way\"\n\n### Inserter Orientation and Positioning Issues\n- Ensure inserters are properly oriented to reach both their pickup and drop locations\n- Multiple attempts were made to correct inserter orientation, suggesting need for better initial placement planning\n- Consider the working area of inserters when positioning them relative to belts and furnaces\n\n### Belt Flow Issues\n- Transport belts showing \"blocked\" warnings indicate need for proper item removal setup\n- Ensure there is adequate space for items to flow through the transport system\n\n### Resource Flow Optimization\n- Mining drill showing \"waiting for space in destination\" indicates backup in the transport system\n- Need to ensure proper balance between mining, transport and consumption rates\n\nNAMESPACE\n\n### Variables\n- `belt`: TransportBelt - Used for conveyor system\n- `inserter`: BurnerInserter - Used for item movement\n- `furnace`: Furnace - Used for smelting operations\n- `mining_drill`: BurnerMiningDrill - Used for resource extraction\n\n### Entity States\nThe logs show detailed entity states including:\n- Fuel levels\n- Operational status\n- Warning conditions\n- Positional data\n- Neighbor relationships\n\nThese state details are crucial for debugging and optimizing the automation setup."}
