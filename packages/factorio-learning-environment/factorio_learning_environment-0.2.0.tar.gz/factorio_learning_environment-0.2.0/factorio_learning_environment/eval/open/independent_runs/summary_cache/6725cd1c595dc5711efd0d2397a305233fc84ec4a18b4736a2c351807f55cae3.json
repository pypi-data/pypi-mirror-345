{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) storing extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-1.5, y=0.5) intended to transfer iron plates from the furnace to another destination.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Inserter Misalignment\n- Ensure that inserters are correctly aligned with their source and destination entities. Misalignment can prevent the transfer of items, as seen with the inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5).\n\n### Errors due to Lack of Fuel\n- Keep a sufficient supply of coal in your inventory to refuel mining drills and inserters. Running out of coal can halt production processes.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Not Receiving Ingredients\n- Verify that the inserter setup allows for the transfer of iron ore to the furnace. Regularly check and adjust the inserter positions to ensure continuous operation.\n\n### Errors when Inserter is Waiting for Source Items\n- Monitor the status of inserters to ensure they are not waiting for source items unnecessarily. This can indicate a blockage or misalignment in the production line."}
