{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (1.0, 1.0) and (3.0, 1.0)\n- Burner Inserters at positions (1.5, -0.5), (3.5, -0.5), (-0.5, 1.5), (1.5, 2.5), and (3.5, 2.5)\n  - Inserters are set to pick up from positions (1.5, 0.5), (3.5, 0.5), (0.5, 1.5), (1.5, 3.5), and (3.5, 3.5) respectively, and drop at positions (1.5, -1.5), (3.5, -1.5), (-1.5, 1.5), (1.5, 1.5), and (3.5, 1.5) respectively.\n\n### Belt System\n- BeltGroup connecting various positions with belts running in different directions for item transportation.\n  - Belt from (x=-11.5, y=-50.5) to (x=-13.5, y=-50.5) in direction LEFT\n  - Belt from (x=-13.5, y=-50.5) to (x=-13.5, y=-52.5) in direction UP\n  - Belt from (x=-12.5, y=-50.5) to (x=-12.5, y=-52.5) in direction UP\n  - Belt from (x=-11.5, y=-49.5) to (x=-11.5, y=-51.5) in direction UP\n  - Belt from (x=-11.5, y=-52.5) to (x=-13.5, y=-52.5) in direction LEFT\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Insufficient Inventory\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities. This will prevent errors like \"Could not insert: No coal to insert from your inventory\" and \"Could not insert: No iron-ore to insert from your inventory.\"\n\n### Errors with Non-Functioning Furnaces\n- Verify that furnaces have both fuel and the necessary ingredients to operate. Warnings such as \"Furnace at x=1.0 y=1.0 is still not working\" and \"Furnace at x=3.0 y=1.0 is still not working\" indicate missing resources.\n\n### Inserter Configuration Issues\n- Check that inserters are correctly configured to pick up and drop items from/to the intended positions. Misconfigurations can lead to warnings like \"inserter waiting for source items\" and \"out of fuel.\"\n\nBy addressing these errors, the efficiency and functionality of your production setup can be significantly improved."}
