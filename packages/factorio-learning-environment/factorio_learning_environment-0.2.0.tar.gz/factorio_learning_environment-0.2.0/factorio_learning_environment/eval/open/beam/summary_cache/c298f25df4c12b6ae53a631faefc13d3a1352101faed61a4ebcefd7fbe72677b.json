{"content": "\"\"\"\nThe attempt to load stone into the active furnace has resulted in the following outcomes:\n\n### Active Furnace Output Status:\n- The active furnace now shows **3 pieces of stone** after the loading operation.\n- The status is now **\"WORKING\"**, indicating that the furnace is engaged in processing.\n\n### Overall Inventory Overview:\n- **Current Inventory**:\n  - 4 pieces of stone furnaces\n  - 7 pieces of coal remaining\n  - 5 pieces of iron ore\n  - **1 piece of copper ore** available.\n  - **21 pieces of iron plates** accumulated in inventory.\n\n### Observations:\n- The furnace has successfully accepted **2 pieces of stone** from the total **5 pieces** I attempted to load, but it appears that **3 pieces of stone** remain in the furnace.\n- The furnace is now actively working, which is a positive development.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Load Copper Ore into the Furnace**: Now that the furnace is working, I should insert the **1 piece of Copper Ore** to allow it to start the smelting process.\n2. **Monitor Smelting Operations**: After loading the Copper Ore, I will observe the furnace to ensure it begins converting the Copper Ore into Copper Plates.\n\nLet's proceed by inserting the Copper Ore into the active furnace. \n\"\"\"\n\n# Load the Copper Ore into the active furnace to enable smelting\ninsert_item(Prototype.CopperOre, active_furnace, quantity=1)  # Insert the Copper Ore into the active furnace\n\n# Check the inventory status of the furnace after loading Copper Ore\nactive_furnace_inventory_status_after_copper_insertion = inspect_inventory(active_furnace)  # Inspect the status of the furnace post-insertion\noverall_inventory_after_copper_loading = inspect_inventory()  # Check total inventory after inserting Copper Ore.\n\nprint(f\"Active Furnace inventory status after loading Copper Ore: {active_furnace_inventory_status_after_copper_insertion}\")  # Status of the furnace after loading Copper Ore.\nprint(f\"Overall current inventory after loading Copper Ore: {overall_inventory_after_copper_loading}\")  # Total inventory post operations.\nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")  # Review entities available on the map.", "summary_range": "[1-348]"}
