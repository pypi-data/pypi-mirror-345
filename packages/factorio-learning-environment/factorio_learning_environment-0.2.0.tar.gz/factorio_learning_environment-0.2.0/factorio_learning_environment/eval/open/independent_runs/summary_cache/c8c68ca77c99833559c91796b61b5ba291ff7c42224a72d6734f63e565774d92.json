{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Operation\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, y=-60.0) extracting iron ore, with a drop position at (4.5, y=-58.5).\n- **Wooden Chests** for storage:\n  - Chest at position (4.5, y=-58.5) containing iron ore.\n  - Additional chests at positions (5.5, 6.5, 7.5, 8.5, 9.5, y=-60.5) for overflow storage.\n- **Stone Furnaces** for smelting:\n  - Furnace at position (-15.0, y=-48.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n  - Furnace at position (-13.0, y=-48.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n  - Furnace at position (-11.0, y=-48.0) currently inactive due to lack of ingredients.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-14.5, -13.5, -12.5, -11.5, -10.5, -9.5, -8.5, -7.5, -6.5, y=-50.5) storing iron plates. Some chests are full, indicated by warnings.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Full Chests\n- Ensure to regularly empty chests that are full to prevent mining operations from halting. The chest at position (4.5, y=-58.5) is full, which could stop the burner mining drill from working.\n\n### Errors Related to Furnace Operations\n- Ensure that all furnaces have the necessary ingredients to maintain continuous operation. The furnace at position (-11.0, y=-48.0) has a warning indicating no ingredients to smelt.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `iron_ore_extracted`: Tracks the amount of iron ore extracted from the chest.\n- `iron_ore_inserted`: Tracks the amount of iron ore inserted into each furnace.\n- `inventory`: A dictionary representing the agent's current inventory, including items like wood, coal, and iron gear wheels."}
