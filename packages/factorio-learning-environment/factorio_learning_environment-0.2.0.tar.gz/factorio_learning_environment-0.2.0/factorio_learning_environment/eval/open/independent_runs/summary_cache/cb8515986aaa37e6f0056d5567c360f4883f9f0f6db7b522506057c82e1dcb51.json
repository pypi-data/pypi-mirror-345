{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) which extracts iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) used to store extracted iron ore and iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) which transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0) which processes iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when extracting items from a chest\n- Ensure that the chest contains the items you intend to extract. Verify the contents of the chest before attempting extraction.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient fuel\n- Keep track of fuel levels in all entities that require it, such as mining drills, inserters, and furnaces. Regularly refuel these entities to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Errors when the chest is full\n- Regularly monitor the inventory of chests to prevent them from becoming full. Empty the chests periodically to ensure that mining and processing operations can continue without interruption."}
