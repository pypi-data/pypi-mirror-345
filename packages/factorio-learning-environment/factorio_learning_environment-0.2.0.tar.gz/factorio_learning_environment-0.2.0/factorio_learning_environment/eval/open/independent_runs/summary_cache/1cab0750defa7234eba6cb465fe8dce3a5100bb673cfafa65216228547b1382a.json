{"content": "# FACTORIO AGENT REPORT\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System at Position (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, -0.5)\n- Boiler at position (-4.5, 3.0)\n- Steam engine at position (1.5, 7.5)\n- Pipe network connecting these components\n- Burner inserter at position (-2.5, 3.5) for feeding coal into the boiler\nThe system is operational and generating electricity for the factory. The agent has been regularly refueling the boiler with coal from the mining operations.\n\n### Coal Mining Operation at Position (16.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at position (16.0, 0.0)\n- Wooden chest at position (15.5, -1.5) for coal collection\n- Burner inserter at position (15.5, -2.5)\n- Transport belt at position (15.5, -3.5)\nThis structure is mining coal and storing it in the wooden chest, which currently contains 249 coal. The agent has been extracting coal from this chest to fuel the boiler and mining drills.\n\n### Secondary Coal Mining Operation at Position (16.0, 5.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at position (16.0, 5.0)\n- Wooden chest at position (16.5, 6.5) for coal collection\n- Burner inserter at position (16.5, 7.5)\nThis structure is mining coal and storing it in the wooden chest, which currently contains 342 coal. The inserter is waiting to output but has no valid destination, showing a warning that \"output is blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\"\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Complex at Position (15.5-24.5, 70.5)\nConsists of:\n- Four electric mining drills at positions (15.5, 70.5), (18.5, 70.5), (21.5, 70.5), and (24.5, 70.5)\n- Four wooden chests at positions (15.5, 72.5), (18.5, 72.5), (21.5, 72.5), and (24.5, 72.5) for ore collection\n- Transport belt network connecting the area\n- Small electric poles for power distribution\nThe mining drills are operational with electricity connected from the steam engine. All four chests are full of iron ore (800 ore each), causing the mining drills to show warnings about full chests. The agent has been extracting iron ore from these chests to feed the smelting operations.\n\n### Iron Smelting Facility at Position (14.0-35.0, 76.0)\nConsists of:\n- Eight stone furnaces at positions (14.0, 76.0), (17.0, 76.0), (20.0, 76.0), (23.0, 76.0), (26.0, 76.0), (29.0, 76.0), (32.0, 76.0), and (35.0, 76.0)\n- Four wooden chests at positions (14.5, 79.5), (17.5, 79.5), (20.5, 79.5), and (23.5, 79.5) for iron plate collection\n- Eight burner inserters at positions (14.5, 78.5), (17.5, 78.5), (20.5, 78.5), (23.5, 78.5), (26.5, 78.5), (29.5, 78.5), (32.5, 78.5), and (35.5, 78.5) for extracting plates from furnaces\n- Two additional burner inserters at positions (14.5, 80.5) and (17.5, 80.5) for moving plates from collection chests\n\nThe furnaces are in various states of operation:\n- First furnace (14.0, 76.0) contains stone and is producing stone bricks, with 74 iron plates in its output\n- Second furnace (17.0, 76.0) has iron ore (5) and contains 100 iron plates in its output (full)"}
