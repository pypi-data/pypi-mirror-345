{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) extracting iron ore, connected to transport belts.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-10.0, -50.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserters at positions (-10.5, -48.5), (-7.5, -49.5), and (-5.5, -49.5) for moving materials between entities.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-8.5, -49.5) for storing produced items.\n- BeltGroup consisting of multiple belts connecting the mining drill to the furnace and other entities.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Connecting Belts to Entities\n- Ensure you use an inserter to connect belts to entities like Stone Furnace or Wooden Chest. Belts cannot be directly connected to these entities.\n\n### Errors Due to Undefined Variables\n- Double-check variable names and ensure they are defined before use. For example, ensure 'drill_to_belt_inserter' is correctly defined and initialized before accessing its properties.\n\n### Errors When Inserting Items Without Inventory\n- Verify that the required items are available in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity.\n\n### General Tips\n- Regularly check and refuel entities like mining drills and furnaces to maintain production efficiency.\n- Investigate low production issues by checking for bottlenecks or resource shortages in the production chain."}
