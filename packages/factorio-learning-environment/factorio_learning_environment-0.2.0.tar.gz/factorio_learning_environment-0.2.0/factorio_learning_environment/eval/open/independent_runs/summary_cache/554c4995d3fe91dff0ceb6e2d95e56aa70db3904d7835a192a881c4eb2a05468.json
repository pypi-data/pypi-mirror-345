This can be verified by checking the map or using a function to confirm the entity's presence.\n\n### Errors related to undefined variables\n- Always define and initialize variables before using them in operations. Double-check variable names for typos or incorrect references.\n\n### Errors when inspecting non-existent chests\n- Verify that chests are placed successfully at the intended positions before attempting to inspect their inventory. Use functions to check for the presence of chests at specific coordinates.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items."}
