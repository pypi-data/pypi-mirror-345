{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (-1.5, 24.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine, with pipes at positions (-8.5, 23.5) and (-9.5, 23.5)\n\n### Smelting Area\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0) with coal fuel\n- Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0) with coal fuel\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) not receiving electricity\n- Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5) and another at (6.5, -59.5)\n\n### Research Lab\nConsists of:\n- Lab with automation science packs at Position (not specified), currently not in progress\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of:\n- Multiple small electric poles connecting various entities, with no power currently supplied\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Pipe Connection\n- Ensure that pipes are correctly aligned and connected between the offshore pump and the boiler. Verify the fluid systems are matching before attempting to connect pipes.\n\n### Fluid System Mismatch\n- The offshore pump and boiler must be on the same fluid system. Check the fluid system IDs and ensure they match before connecting.\n\n### Inserter Power Issues\n- Ensure inserters are connected to a power source. Verify the electricity network is operational and providing power to connected entities.\n\n### Boiler and Steam Engine Connection\n- Make sure the boiler and steam engine are properly connected with pipes and are part of the same fluid system to allow steam generation and electricity production."}
