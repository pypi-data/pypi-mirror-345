{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Automation Science Pack Production Setup\nLocated around position (8.5, 13.5), consists of:\n- Assembling machine-1 at (8.5, 13.5)\n- Input chest for iron gears at (8.5, 10.5)\n- Input chest for copper plates at (6.5, 14.5)\n- Output chest at (11.5, 13.5)\n- Burner inserters at:\n  - (8.5, 11.5) for iron gears input\n  - (6.5, 13.5) for copper plates input\n  - (10.5, 13.5) for output\n- Electric pole at (8.5, 17.5)\n- Transport belt system connecting components\n\n### Power Generation System\nLocated around position (-4.5, 12.5), consists of:\n- Steam engine at (-4.5, 12.5)\n- Boiler at (-4.5, 16.0)\n- Offshore pump at (-3.5, 27.5)\n- Connected pipe networks for water and steam\n- Multiple electric poles forming electricity network\n\n### Mining and Smelting Operations\nMultiple setups at different locations:\n1. First setup at (-28.0, -61.0):\n   - Burner mining drill\n   - Wooden chest at (-27.5, -59.5)\n   - Stone furnace at (-25.0, -59.0)\n   - Output chest at (-22.5, -58.5)\n   - Burner inserters connecting components\n\n2. Second setup at (-18.0, -53.0):\n   - Burner mining drill\n   - Wooden chest at (-17.5, -51.5)\n   - Stone furnace at (-15.0, -51.0)\n   - Output chest at (-12.5, -50.5)\n   - Burner inserters connecting components\n\n3. Third setup at (41.0, -82.0):\n   - Burner mining drill\n   - Wooden chest at (41.5, -80.5)\n   - Burner inserter at (41.5, -79.5)\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Errors\n- When placing entities next to transport belts, increase spacing or change direction as belts block placement\n- Verify target position is clear before attempting to place entities\n- Consider the dimensions of entities when placing them near other structures\n\n### Resource Management Errors\n- Cannot craft copper plates directly - must use furnace\n- Ensure required items are in inventory before attempting insertion operations\n- Keep mining drills fueled to maintain continuous operation\n\n### Power Connection Issues\n- Ensure all machines requiring electricity are connected to power network\n- When placing electric poles, account for existing structures that may block connections\n- Consider creating separate power networks if direct connections are blocked by structures\n\n### Production Setup Issues\n- Verify all components of production chains are properly connected and powered\n- Ensure input/output chests are correctly positioned relative to inserters\n- Monitor machine status for ingredient shortages and power issues"}
