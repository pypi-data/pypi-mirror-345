{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Transport System (around x=41-45, y=-80 to -83)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (x=41.0, y=-82.0) mining coal, working status\n- Input chest (iron chest at x=41.5, y=-83.5) containing 1600 coal\n- Storage chest (wooden chest at x=41.5, y=-80.5) containing 551 coal\n- Transport belt (x=42.5, y=-80.5) facing RIGHT\n- Belt system connecting from y=-68.5 to y=-77.5 with 10 belts\n\n### Furnace System (around x=45-50, y=-81)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace 1 (x=45.0, y=-81.0) with 50 coal fuel\n- Stone furnace 2 (x=47.0, y=-81.0) with 50 coal fuel \n- Output chest (wooden chest at x=49.5, y=-80.5) containing 1500 iron plates\n\nERROR TIPS\n- Inserter placement errors due to occupied tiles:\n  - Always check if target location is clear before placing inserters\n  - Remove any existing entities at the target location first\n  - Verify inserter pickup/drop positions don't conflict with other entities\n\n- Inserter direction issues:\n  - Multiple attempts to adjust inserter facing direction (LEFT, UP, WEST, NORTH) indicate confusion about proper orientation\n  - Plan inserter directions carefully based on source/destination positions\n  - Verify inserter pickup/drop positions match intended material flow\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nImportant Variables:\n- chest_inserter: BurnerInserter\n- furnace_inserter: BurnerInserter\n\nFunctions:\n- place_entity(): Places entities on the map\n  - Success: When target location is clear\n  - Failure: When location is occupied by another entity\n\nThe agent appears to be struggling with inserter placement and orientation optimization for the coal transport system. Multiple attempts to adjust and replace inserters suggest the need for better placement planning."}
