{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo structures have been created on the map.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n* Errors when using undefined modules\n  - Ensure that the necessary modules are imported before using them. In this case, the `random` module needs to be imported before using `random.randint()`.\n* Errors when calculating factorials of large numbers\n  - Be aware that calculating factorials of large numbers can result in extremely large numbers that may exceed the maximum limit of the data type.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n* Defined functions:\n  + `generate_random_number()`: This function is intended to generate a random number, but it is currently not implemented correctly due to the undefined `random` module.\n  + Unnamed function to calculate the factorial of a number: This function is able to calculate the factorial of a given number, but it may not be able to handle very large numbers due to data type limitations.\n* Important variables:\n  + `random_number`: The intended output of the `generate_random_number()` function.\n  + `x` and `y` coordinates: Used to store the location of the nearest iron ore."}
