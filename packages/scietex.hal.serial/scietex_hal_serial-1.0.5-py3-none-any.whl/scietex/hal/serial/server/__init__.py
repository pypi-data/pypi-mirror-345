"""
Modbus server initialization module.

This module consolidates and exports key components of the Modbus server framework, including the
reactive data block and the RS485 server implementation. Developers can utilize these components to
build and configure Modbus servers tailored to their specific requirements.

Exported Classes:
    - ReactiveSequentialDataBlock: Custom reactive data block for Modbus servers, supporting
      callbacks on value changes.
    - RS485Server: Implementation of an RS485 Modbus server capable of managing multiple slave
      contexts and responding to Modbus requests.

This module provides a solid foundation for constructing Modbus servers, enabling seamless
integration into larger automation and IoT systems.
