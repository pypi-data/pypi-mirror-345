{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (x=17.5, y=20.5) with warnings of 'no input liquid' and 'no fluid present in connections', indicating it is not connected properly.\n- Boiler at Position (x=1.5, y=23.0) with a warning of 'out of fuel', indicating it requires fuel to operate.\n- Offshore Pump at Position (x=-9.5, y=24.5), which is working and supplying water to the system.\n- Pipe network connecting these components, with notable positions including (x=1.5, y=21.5) and (x=17.5, y=20.5), but facing connection issues.\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- PipeGroup at Position (x=9.5, y=15.5) with status EMPTY.\n- PipeGroup at Position (x=6.5, y=21.5) with status EMPTY.\n- PipeGroup at Position (x=-9.5, y=23.5) with status FULL_OUTPUT, indicating successful water transport from the offshore pump.\n\n### Electricity Network\n- ElectricityGroup with ID 47741, consisting of poles at various positions like (x=14.5, y=20.5) and (x=35.5, y=20.5), but currently showing a voltage of 0, indicating no power is being distributed.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure that the pipes and underground pipes are correctly aligned and connected to the intended entities. Double-check the positions and directions to avoid failed connections.\n\n### Steam Engine Not Receiving Input\n- Verify that the steam engine is properly connected to a source of steam or water and that the pipes are not obstructed or incorrectly placed.\n\n### Boiler Out of Fuel\n- Regularly check the fuel levels in the boiler and ensure it is refueled to maintain operation.\n\n### Electricity Network Not Functioning\n- Ensure all electric poles are connected and that there is a power source generating electricity. Check for any breaks in the network that could disrupt power flow.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n- **pipes**: A variable intended to store connected pipe entities. Ensure that the connection logic is correct to avoid exceptions.\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `pipes`: List of pipe connections, type: List[Position].\n  - `boiler`: Boiler entity, type: Boiler.\n  - `steam-engine`: Steam engine entity, type: Generator.\n  - `offshore-pump`: Offshore pump entity, type: OffshorePump."}
