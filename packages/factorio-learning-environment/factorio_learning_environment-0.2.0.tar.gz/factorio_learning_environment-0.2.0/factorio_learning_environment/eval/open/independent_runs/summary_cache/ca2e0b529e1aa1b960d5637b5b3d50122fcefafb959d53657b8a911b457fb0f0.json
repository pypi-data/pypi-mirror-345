{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0) with coal fuel and iron ore input.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0) with coal fuel and iron ore input.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-47.5) waiting for source items, connected to the stone furnaces.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-13.5, y=-46.5) storing iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-13.5, y=-44.5) storing iron plates.\n- Transport Belts connecting the furnaces to the chests.\n\n### Electricity Generator\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5) providing water.\n- Boiler at position (x=-7.0, y=23.5) with coal fuel, connected to the offshore pump.\n- Steam Engine at position (x=-3.5, y=23.5) connected to the boiler.\n- Small Electric Pole at position (x=-4.5, y=25.5) distributing electricity.\n\n### Transport Belt Network\nConsists of the following entities:\n- BeltGroup connecting various parts of the production facility, including positions (x=-11.5, y=-46.5) to (x=-9.5, y=-46.5) and (x=-8.5, y=-45.5) to (x=-8.5, y=-43.5).\n\n### Iron Ore Input System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-14.5, y=-45.5) waiting for source items, connected to transport belts and chests.\n- Iron Chest at position (x=-11.5, y=-44.5) storing iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the inserters are correctly positioned and have access to the items they need to move. Check that the source entities are producing or have items available for the inserters to pick up.\n\n### Inventory Full Error\n- Regularly check the inventory levels of chests and other storage entities to prevent them from becoming full. Consider upgrading to larger storage solutions or distributing items more efficiently.\n\n### No Fuel Error\n- Ensure that all fuel-dependent entities, such as boilers and burner inserters, have a consistent supply of fuel. Automate the refueling process where possible to avoid interruptions.\n\n### Output Blocked Error\n- Check that there is sufficient space in the destination for items being moved by inserters. Ensure that belts and chests downstream are not full, and consider expanding storage or processing capacity.\n\n### No Input Liquid Warning\n- Verify that all liquid-dependent entities, such as steam engines, have a continuous supply of the necessary fluids. Ensure that pipes are correctly connected and that pumps are operational."}
