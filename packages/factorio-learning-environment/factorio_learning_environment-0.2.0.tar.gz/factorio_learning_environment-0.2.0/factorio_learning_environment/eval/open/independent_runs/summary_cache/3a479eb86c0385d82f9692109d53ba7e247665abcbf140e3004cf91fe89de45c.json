{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Distribution System at position (x=41, y=-82)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0) extracting coal.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=41.5, y=-83.5) transferring coal from the mining drill to a wooden chest at position (x=42.5, y=-83.5).\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (x=40.5, y=-83.5), (x=42.5, y=-83.5), and (x=46.5, y=-83.5) for coal storage.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=41.5, y=-80.5) waiting for source items, intended to move coal from the chest at position (x=41.5, y=-79.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) processing iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Furnace** at position (x=2.0, y=0.0) processing iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Coal Transport Belt System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **BeltGroup** connecting the wooden chest at position (x=42.5, y=-83.5) to another point, facilitating the transport of coal.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entity for the inserter has items available for transfer. Check the inventory of the source entity and ensure it is not empty.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
