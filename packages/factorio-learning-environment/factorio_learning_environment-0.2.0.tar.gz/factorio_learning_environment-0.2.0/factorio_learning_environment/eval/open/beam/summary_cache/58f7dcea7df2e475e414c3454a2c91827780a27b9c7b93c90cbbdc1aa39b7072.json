{"content": "\"\"\"\nThe extraction attempt has successfully cleared the active furnace:\n\n### Active Furnace Output Status:\n- The active furnace is now empty, with no items remaining inside.\n- The status has changed to **\"NO INGREDIENTS\"**, indicating that it is not currently processing anything.\n\n### Overall Inventory Overview:\n- **Current Inventory**:\n  - 4 pieces of stone furnaces\n  - 7 pieces of coal remaining\n  - 5 pieces of iron ore\n  - **1 piece of copper ore** available.\n  - **21 pieces of iron plates** available (after extraction).\n\n### Observations:\n- The extraction process has successfully reset the furnace, allowing for a fresh start with loading materials.\n- The furnace is now ready to accept new inputs, but I need to ensure I have the correct materials to initiate smelting.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Load Stone into the Furnace**: I will insert **2 pieces of stone** into the furnace to meet the requirements for smelting Copper Ore.\n2. **Load Copper Ore into the Furnace**: After loading the stone, I will add the **1 piece of Copper Ore** to initiate the smelting process.\n3. **Monitor Smelting Operations**: Finally, I will check to ensure the furnace begins processing the Copper Ore into Copper Plates.\n\nLet\u2019s proceed by loading the stone into the active furnace. \n\"\"\"\n\n# Load the required stone into the active furnace to enable smelting\ninsert_item(Prototype.Stone, active_furnace, quantity=2)  # Insert 2 pieces of stone into the active furnace\n\n# Check the inventory status of the furnace after loading stone\nactive_furnace_inventory_status_after_stone_insertion = inspect_inventory(active_furnace)  # Inspect the status of the furnace post-insertion\noverall_inventory_after_stone_loading = inspect_inventory()  # Check total inventory after inserting stone.\n\nprint(f\"Active Furnace inventory status after loading stone: {active_furnace_inventory_status_after_stone_insertion}\")  # Status of the furnace after loading stone.\nprint(f\"Overall current inventory after loading stone: {overall_inventory_after_stone_loading}\")  # Total inventory post operations.\nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")  # Review entities available on the map.", "summary_range": "[1-340]"}
