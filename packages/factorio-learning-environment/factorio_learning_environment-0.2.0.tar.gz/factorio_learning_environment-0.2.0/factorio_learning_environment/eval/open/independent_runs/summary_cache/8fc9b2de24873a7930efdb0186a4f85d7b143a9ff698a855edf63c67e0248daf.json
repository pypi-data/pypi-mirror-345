{"content": "# Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=0.5, y=28.0)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (x=10.5, y=34.5)\n- Boiler at Position (x=0.5, y=28.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (x=-3.5, y=27.5)\n- Pipe Group transporting water from the offshore pump to the boiler\n- Pipe Group transporting steam from the boiler to the steam engine\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage at Position (x=40.0, y=-84.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (x=40.0, y=-84.0)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (x=40.5, y=-82.5) for storing coal\n- Wooden Chest at Position (x=41.5, y=-83.5) for additional storage\n\n### Power Network Expansion\nConsists of:\n- Electricity Group connecting the lab at Position (x=5.5, y=5.5) to the power source at Position (x=10.5, y=34.5) with multiple electric poles\n\n### Iron Plate Storage\nConsists of:\n- Iron Chest at Position (x=56.5, y=-83.5) storing iron plates\n\n### Miscellaneous Entities\n- Burner Inserters at Positions (x=54.5, y=-83.5) and (x=41.5, y=-80.5)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=-15.0, y=-49.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n- Lab with no power input\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Pipe Connections\n- Ensure all pipe connections are correctly aligned and connected between the boiler and steam engine. Verify the presence of all necessary pipes and their correct placement to avoid connection failures.\n\n### Errors when No Pipe Group Found\n- Double-check the pipe group connections to ensure they are complete and correctly configured. Missing or incorrect connections can lead to errors in fluid transport.\n\n### Errors when Refueling\n- Ensure that the correct amount of fuel is available and properly allocated to the intended entities to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Errors with Inventory Management\n- Regularly check and manage inventory to prevent overflow or shortages that can disrupt operations."}
