{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-20, -70)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) connected to a transport belt network.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -70.0) and another at position (-18.0, -70.0), both with warnings of no ingredients to smelt.\n- Transport Belt network connecting the mining drill to the furnaces.\n- Wooden Chests at positions (-23.5, -69.5) and (-24.5, -67.5) for storage.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining Facility at Position (53, -83)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) connected to a wooden chest at position (52.5, -84.5).\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Facility at Position (-14, -53)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) with a warning of no fuel.\n- Transport Belt network connecting to a wooden chest at position (-12.5, -54.5).\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5) waiting for source items.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage Facility at Position (0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with warnings of no ingredients to smelt and full fuel source.\n- Wooden Chests at positions (1.5, 0.5) and (3.5, 0.5) for storage.\n- Burner Inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) waiting for source items.\n\n### Belt Networks\n- Multiple Belt Groups connecting various entities, facilitating the movement of resources between mining drills, furnaces, and storage chests.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### TypeError in Code\n- Ensure all required arguments are provided when calling functions or methods. For example, check the function `_modifier()` for missing arguments.\n\n### NameError for Undefined Variables\n- Ensure all variables and classes are defined before use. For instance, verify the correct spelling and capitalization of 'TransportBelt' and ensure it is imported or defined in the scope.\n\n### Warnings of No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to process. Check the supply chain to ensure resources are being delivered to the furnaces.\n\n### Warnings of Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that inserters have access to the items they need to move. Check the inventory of connected entities and ensure the supply chain is functioning correctly.\n\n### Warnings of No Fuel\n- Ensure that mining drills and other fuel-dependent entities have a sufficient supply of fuel to operate. Regularly check and replenish fuel supplies as needed."}
