{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nThis facility is designed to mine iron ore, transfer it to a furnace, and produce iron plates. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore from the ground.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Temporarily stores extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the stone furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0): Smelts iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Insufficient Fuel\n- Ensure that all fuel-dependent entities such as mining drills, inserters, and furnaces are adequately refueled with coal or other fuel sources to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Errors in Inserter Alignment\n- Verify that inserters are correctly positioned and aligned to transfer items between entities. Misalignment can prevent the transfer of materials, halting production processes.\n\n### Errors from Full Inventory or Storage\n- Regularly check and clear inventories of entities like chests and furnaces to prevent them from becoming full, which can disrupt the flow of materials and halt production.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces and other processing entities have the necessary ingredients to operate. Regularly supply them with the required materials to avoid production stoppages."}
