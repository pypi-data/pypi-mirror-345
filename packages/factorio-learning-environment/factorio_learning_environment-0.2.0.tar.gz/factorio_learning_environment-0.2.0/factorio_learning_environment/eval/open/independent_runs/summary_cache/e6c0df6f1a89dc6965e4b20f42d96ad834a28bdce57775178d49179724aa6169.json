{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Mining and Smelting Setup\n- **Electric mining drill** at (15.5, 70.5) - Extracts iron ore (output blocked)\n- **Wooden chest** at (15.5, 75.5) - Ore storage\n- **Wooden chest** at (17.5, 75.5) - Plate storage\n- **Burner inserter** at (16.5, 75.5) - Transfers items\n\n### Copper Mining Setup\n- **Wooden chest** at (-46.5, 74.5) - Copper ore storage\n- Connected to power network via small electric pole at (-44.5, 68.5)\n\n### Power Generation System\n- **Offshore pump** at (-9.5, -0.5) - Water source\n- **Boiler** at (-6.0, -0.5) - Steam production (currently out of fuel)\n- **Steam engine** at (-0.5, -0.5) - Power generation (not connected)\n- Pipe network connecting pump to boiler (fluid system 2525)\n- Separate pipe network for steam (fluid system 2527)\n\n### Circuit Production Setup\n- **Assembling machine 2** at (-5.5, 3.5) - Circuit production (no power)\n- **Wooden chest** at (-7.5, 3.5) - Input/output storage\n- Connected to power pole at (-3.5, 1.5)\n\n### Remote Production Outpost\n- **Assembling machine 2** at (50.5, 50.5) - Circuit production (no power)\n- **Wooden chests** at (48.5, 50.5) and (52.5, 50.5) - Storage\n- Connected to power pole at (49.5, 48.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Persistent Building Placement Issues\n- Multiple failed attempts to place entities on water/invalid tiles (8.0,10.0), (5.0,5.0), (-4.0,3.5)\n- Implement pre-placement validation:\n  1. Check tile type (not water)\n  2. Scan for existing entities\n  3. Verify power network proximity\n\n### Power System Configuration Errors\n- Steam engine not receiving steam due to pipe connection issues\n- Boiler showing \"out of fuel\" warning\n- Ensure:\n  1. Proper fluid connections between pump-boiler-engine\n  2. Continuous coal supply to boiler\n  3. Correct pipe orientation and connections\n\n### Code Implementation Errors\n- Undefined variables ('math', 'circuit_assembler')\n- Always:\n  1. Import required modules\n  2. Initialize variables before use\n  3. Verify function return values\n\n### Distance-Related Placement Failures\n- Attempted to place assembling machine 45.96 tiles away (max is 10)\n- Maintain proximity when building:\n  1. Stay within 10 tile radius\n  2. Use temporary power poles for remote builds\n  3. Implement chunk-by-chunk expansion\n\n### Fluid System Mismatches\n- Pipe connection failures between offshore pump and boiler\n- Verify:\n  1. Connection point alignment\n  2. Fluid type compatibility\n  3. Input/output directions\n\n### Previous Unresolved Issues\n- Iron drill output still blocked\n- Power network remains unstable\n- Prioritize fixing existing infrastructure before expansion\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Defined Functions\n- `find_clear_land_near_power()` -> Position\n  - Attempts to find buildable land near power sources\n  - Failed due to undefined 'math' module\n\n### Important Variables\n- `steam_engine`: Entity reference to power generator\n- `boiler`: Entity reference to steam producer\n- `offshore_pump`: Entity reference to water source"}
