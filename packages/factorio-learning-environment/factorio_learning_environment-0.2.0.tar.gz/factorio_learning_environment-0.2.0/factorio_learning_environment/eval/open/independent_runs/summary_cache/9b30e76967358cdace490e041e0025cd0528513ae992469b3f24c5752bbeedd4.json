{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-47.5, -123.5)\n- Pipe at position (-47.5, -122.5)\n- Boiler at position (-46.5, -121.0)\n- Steam Engine at position (-41.5, -117.5)\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -73.0)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (9.0, -64.0)\n\n### Additional Furnace Setup\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (6.0, -62.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (7.5, -61.5)\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5)\n\n### Storage and Processing Area\nConsists of:\n- Wooden Chest at position (6.5, -59.5)\n- Lab with input of automation science packs, status: No Power\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- PipeGroup at position (-47.5, -122.5) with fluid system 21460, status: Full Output\n- Multiple empty PipeGroups at various positions indicating potential future expansions or connections\n\n### Electricity Network\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at various positions, currently not supplying power\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities on Occupied Tiles\n- Ensure the target tile is free of other entities before attempting to place a new entity. Remove any existing entities if necessary.\n\n### Connection Errors for Boiler and Water Source\n- Verify all necessary connections between the boiler and the water source. Ensure pipes are correctly placed and connected to facilitate fluid flow.\n\n### Power Connection Issues\n- Ensure that all electrical entities are connected to a power network. Check that poles are properly placed and connected to supply power to all required structures.\n\n### Inserter Power Supply Issues\n- Make sure inserters are connected to a functional power network to operate effectively. Check for any disconnected poles or missing connections."}
