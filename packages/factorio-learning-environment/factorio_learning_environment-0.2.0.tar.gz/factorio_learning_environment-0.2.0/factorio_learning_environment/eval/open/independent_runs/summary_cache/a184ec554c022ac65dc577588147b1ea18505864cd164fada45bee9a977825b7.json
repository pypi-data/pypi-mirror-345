{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Processing Facility at Position (-14.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace 1 at position (-14.0, -49.0) with coal as fuel and iron ore as input.\n- Stone Furnace 2 at position (-12.0, -48.0) with coal as fuel and iron ore as input.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -47.5) waiting for source items, connected to both furnaces.\n- Transport Belt connecting the furnaces to the wooden chests.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-13.5, -46.5) storing iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-13.5, -44.5) storing iron plates.\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-7.0, 23.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Boiler at position (-7.0, 23.5) fueled by coal.\n- Steam Engine at position (-3.5, 23.5) generating electricity.\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5) supplying water to the boiler.\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pump to the boiler.\n\n### Transport and Storage System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Iron Chest at position (-11.5, -44.5) storing iron plates.\n- Transport Belts and Burner Inserters facilitating the movement of items between chests and furnaces.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items without sufficient inventory\n- Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. For example, ensure you have iron ore before inserting into a furnace or coal before refueling a boiler.\n\n### Errors with inserters waiting for source items\n- Check that the source entities have items available for the inserters to pick up. Ensure that the production line is not blocked and that all entities are functioning correctly.\n\n### Errors with inserters running out of fuel\n- Regularly refuel inserters to prevent them from stopping. Monitor fuel levels and automate refueling where possible to maintain continuous operation."}
