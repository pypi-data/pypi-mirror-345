{"content": "I notice there are two key issues to address:\n\n1. The mining drill at (-15.0, 23.0) has no fuel\n2. The mining drill at (-11.0, 25.0) also has no fuel\n\nLet's fix both mining drills by adding coal:\n\n```python\n# First check our inventory\ninventory = inspect_inventory()\nprint(f\"Current inventory: {inventory}\")\n\n# Add fuel to first mining drill\nmove_to(Position(x=-15.0, y=23.0))\ninsert_item(Prototype.Coal, Position(x=-15.0, y=23.0), quantity=5)\nprint(\"Added fuel to first mining drill\")\n\n# Add fuel to second mining drill\nmove_to(Position(x=-11.0, y=25.0))\ninsert_item(Prototype.Coal, Position(x=-11.0, y=25.0), quantity=5)\nprint(\"Added fuel to second mining drill\")\n\n# Verify our changes\nprint(f\"Updated inventory: {inspect_inventory()}\")\n\n# Check both mining drill statuses\ndrill1 = get_entity(Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill, Position(x=-15.0, y=23.0))\ndrill2 = get_entity(Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill, Position(x=-11.0, y=25.0))\n\nif drill1:\n    print(f\"First mining drill status: {drill1.status}\")\nif drill2:\n    print(f\"Second mining drill status: {drill2.status}\")\n```\n\nThis should:\n1. Add coal to both mining drills\n2. Get them both working again\n3. Verify their operational status\n\nLet me know if you need any adjustments to this solution.", "summary_range": "[1-656]"}
