{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-46.5, -122.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (-41.5, -117.5)\n- Small Electric Poles at Positions (-43.5, -117.5), (-39.5, -117.5), and (-39.5, -116.5)\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-19.0, -73.0) for smelting copper ore into copper plates\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates\n\n### Miscellaneous Structures\n- Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0) currently inactive\n- Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5)\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) not receiving electricity\n- Wooden Chest at Position (6.5, -59.5) containing iron plates\n- Lab with no power, inputting automation science packs\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- Multiple Pipe Groups at various positions, all currently empty and not connected to any fluid system\n\n### Electricity Network\n- Electricity Group with poles at various positions, currently not supplying power\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Extracting Items\n- Ensure that the entity you are trying to extract from contains the item you need. For example, attempting to extract copper plates from an entity that does not contain them will result in failure.\n\n### Errors in Connecting Pipes\n- Verify that the start and end positions for connecting pipes are valid and that there are no obstructions. Ensure that the pipes are properly aligned and connected to the intended entities.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Power\n- Ensure that all electrical entities, such as inserters and labs, are connected to a power source. Check the electricity network for connectivity issues and resolve any disconnections.\n\nBy addressing these errors, the efficiency and functionality of the structures can be improved significantly."}
