{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) extracting iron ore.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-14.0, -48.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -49.5) transferring iron ore from the mining drill to the furnace.\n- The mining drill is fueled and operational, with a status of working.\n\n### Additional Stone Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0) with no ingredients to smelt, currently inactive.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Crafting Items\n- Ensure all required sub-ingredients are available in the inventory before attempting to craft an item. For example, iron plates need to be smelted in a furnace, and stone must be gathered as a raw resource.\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities\n- Verify that the target position for placing an entity is not occupied by another object. Adjust the spacing, direction, or reference position if necessary.\n- Move closer to the target position before attempting to place an entity, as the maximum placement distance is limited.\n\n### Errors when Inserting Items\n- Ensure that the inventory contains the required items before attempting to insert them into another entity, such as a furnace.\n\nBy following these tips, the agent can avoid common mistakes and improve efficiency in managing resources and constructing facilities."}
