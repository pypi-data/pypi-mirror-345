Ensure you verify available PipeGroups and select the active one (e.g., fluid_system=13868) before attempting a connection.\n\n\u2022 Fixed Pipeline Stabilization Delays:\n  - The use of fixed 10-second wait intervals after each connection attempt causes unnecessary idle time. Replace these fixed delays with dynamic checks of the pipeline network status for more efficient stabilization."}
