{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll generate a comprehensive report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing System (around position 41,-81)\nComplex automated system consisting of:\n- Burner mining drill (position 41,-82) mining coal\n- Wooden chest for coal storage (position 41.5,-80.5)\n- First burner inserter (position 42.5,-80.5) for coal movement\n- Transport belt (position 42.5,-81.5) moving right\n- Second burner inserter (position 43.5,-81.5) for furnace feeding\n- Stone furnace (position 45,-81)\n\n### Additional Smelting Infrastructure\n- Second stone furnace (position 47,-81)\n- Iron plate storage chest (position 49.5,-80.5) containing 1500 iron plates\n\nERROR TIPS\n1. Storage Management Issues\n- Monitor chest capacity limits - the coal chest repeatedly hits its capacity (800 coal), causing mining to stall\n- Implement a system to prevent or handle \"chest full\" conditions before they occur\n\n2. Furnace Operation Issues\n- Ensure furnaces have both fuel and ingredients before expecting operation\n- Current furnaces show \"no ingredients to smelt\" warnings\n- Second furnace has \"out of fuel\" warning - ensure consistent fuel supply\n\n3. Inserter Configuration Issues\n- The first inserter's pickup/drop positions keep changing between updates, suggesting positioning logic issues\n- Ensure inserter directions and pickup/drop positions are correctly calculated and maintained\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nImportant Variables:\nNone explicitly shown in logs\n\nFunctions:\nNone explicitly defined in logs\n\nThe system appears to be in a testing/verification phase with multiple attempts to rebuild and verify the coal transport system. The main focus seems to be on getting the first inserter's configuration correct, as evidenced by repeated \"Final rebuild of first inserter\" messages."}
