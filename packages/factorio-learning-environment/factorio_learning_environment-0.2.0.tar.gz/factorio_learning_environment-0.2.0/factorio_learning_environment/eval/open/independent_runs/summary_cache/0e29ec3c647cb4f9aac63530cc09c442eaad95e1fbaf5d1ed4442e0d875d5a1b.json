{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Transfer System at Position (-15.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0), extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5), storing extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-15.5, -48.5), transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0), intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Alignment Errors\n- Ensure that the inserter's pickup position is aligned with the chest's position to facilitate correct item transfer. Misalignment can cause the inserter to fail in picking up items.\n\n### Inserter Placement Errors\n- When placing an inserter, ensure there is no collision with existing entities. Consider adjusting spacing, direction, or the reference position to avoid placement errors.\n\n### Fuel Management Errors\n- Ensure that all entities requiring fuel, such as inserters and mining drills, are adequately refueled to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Inventory Management Errors\n- Verify that the required items, such as coal for refueling or iron ore for processing, are available in the inventory before attempting to use them."}
