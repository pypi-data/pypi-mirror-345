{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report - Steps 0-15\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generation at Position(x=-9.5, y=-0.5) to (x=0.5, y=6.5)\nThis structure generates electricity using steam power and attempts automated coal fueling.\n*   **Offshore Pump** at Position(x=-9.5, y=-0.5): Extracts water.\n*   **Boiler** at Position(x=-5.0, y=2.5): Heats water into steam using coal. Status: `WORKING` (as of end of step 15, but previously ran out of fuel).\n*   **Steam Engine** at Position(x=0.5, y=6.5): Consumes steam to generate electricity. Status: `WORKING` (as of end of step 15).\n*   **Fuel Buffer Chest** at Position(x=-7.5, y=3.5): A wooden chest intended to store coal for the boiler.\n*   **Boiler Feed Inserter** at Position(x=-7.5, y=2.5): A burner inserter intended to take coal from the Fuel Buffer Chest (pickup: x=-8.5, y=2.5) and insert it into the Boiler (drop: x=-6.5, y=2.5). Status: `WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS`.\n*   **Fuel Chest Input Inserter** at Position(x=-7.5, y=4.5): A burner inserter intended to take coal from a belt (pickup: x=-7.5, y=5.5) and insert it into the Fuel Buffer Chest (drop: x=-7.5, y=3.5). Status: `WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS`.\n*   **Pipe Group 1** (starting at x=-8.5, y=-0.5): Connects the Offshore Pump to the Boiler's water input.\n*   **Pipe Group 2** (starting at x=-6.5, y=2.5): Connects the Boiler's steam output to the Steam Engine's input.\n\n### Coal Mining at Position(x=17.5, y=1.5)\nThis structure automatically mines coal and attempts to output it onto a belt.\n*   **Electric Mining Drill** at Position(x=17.5, y=1.5): Mines coal from the resource patch. Status: `WORKING` (as of end of step 15"}
