Insert the appropriate intermediary inserter to avoid the \u201ccannot be connected directly\u201d error. (Reported in Steps 210, 211, 213, 214, 215, 216, and 217)\n\n\u2022 For entity placement:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Verify that the player is within the maximum allowed placement distance before attempting to place an entity (e.g. the wooden chest at (3.5, 15.5) must be placed within range). This avoids \u201ctarget position is too far\u201d errors.\n\n\u2022 Inventory management:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Confirm that the necessary item exists in the inventory before placement; a \u201cNo wooden_chest in inventory\u201d error indicates the need to check supplies prior to placement. \n\n\u2022 Variable definition:\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Ensure all variables (such as target_chest) are properly defined and referenced to prevent NameErrors.\n\n"}
