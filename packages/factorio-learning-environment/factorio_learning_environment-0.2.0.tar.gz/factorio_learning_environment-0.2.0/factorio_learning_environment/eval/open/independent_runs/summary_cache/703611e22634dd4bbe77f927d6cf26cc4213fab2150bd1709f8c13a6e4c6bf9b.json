{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=-15.5, y=-51.5) for storing mined iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=62.0, y=-53.0) used for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=60.5, y=-52.5) intended to move items into the Stone Furnace.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Furnace Not Working Properly\n- Ensure the furnace has both fuel and ingredients to smelt. Check that the inserter is correctly supplying the furnace with iron ore and coal.\n\n### Inserting Items Without Inventory\n- Before attempting to insert items, verify that the items are available in your inventory to avoid insertion errors.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Make sure the inserter has a continuous supply of source items to prevent it from idling. Check the connected entities and ensure they are functioning properly.\n\n### Mining Drill Out of Fuel\n- Regularly refuel the mining drill to maintain continuous operation. Monitor fuel levels and replenish as necessary.\n\n### Chest at Drop Position is Full\n- Periodically empty the chest at the mining drill's drop position to prevent mining operations from halting due to a full chest."}
