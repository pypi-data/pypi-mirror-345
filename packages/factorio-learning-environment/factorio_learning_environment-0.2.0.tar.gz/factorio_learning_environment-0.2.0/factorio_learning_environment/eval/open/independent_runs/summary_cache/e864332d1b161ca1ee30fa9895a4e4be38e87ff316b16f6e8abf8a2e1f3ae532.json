{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (3 units)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Neighbours: Wooden Chest, Burner Inserter\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Inventory: Iron Ore (792 units)\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Fuel: Coal (4 units)\n  - Status: Waiting for Source Items\n  - Pickup Position: (x=-12.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Drop Position: (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n  - Neighbours: Wooden Chest, Burner Mining Drill\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (9 units)\n  - Status: No Ingredients\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Furnace Source: Empty\n  - Furnace Result: Iron Plate (2 units)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity on a tile before attempting placement. Consider increasing spacing, changing direction, or changing the reference position to avoid collisions with existing entities.\n\n### Inserter Alignment Issues\n- Ensure that the inserter's pickup and drop positions are correctly aligned with the intended source and destination entities. Misalignment can prevent the inserter from functioning properly.\n\n### Fuel Management Errors\n- Ensure that there is sufficient fuel in your inventory before attempting to refuel entities. Running out of fuel can halt operations.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Ingredients\n- Verify that the inserter setup is correct and that it is positioned to transfer items into the furnace. Check for any misalignment or blockage that might prevent the transfer of ingredients."}
