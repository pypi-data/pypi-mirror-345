{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (5.5, 21.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (5.5, 21.5)\n- Boiler at position (-1.5, 24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe connections from offshore pump to boiler and from boiler to steam engine\n\n### Lab at Position (2.5, 0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Lab with input for automation-science-pack and currently working on Automation research\n\n### Copper Plate Production\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with copper-plate output\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of:\n- Small Electric Poles at various positions including (3.5, 20.5) connecting the steam engine to the lab\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Insufficient Materials\n- Ensure you have enough materials before attempting to craft items. For example, copper plates and copper cables are needed for crafting small electric poles.\n\n### Errors in Entity Connections\n- Verify that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to connect entities like steam engines and labs.\n- Ensure that pipes and other connection entities are correctly placed and connected to avoid failed connections.\n\n### Errors in Lab Operations\n- Make sure that the lab entity is correctly defined and available in the specified position before attempting operations related to it.\n\n### Errors in Code Definitions\n- Double-check variable names and definitions to avoid NameError exceptions. For instance, ensure 'copper_cable_needed_for_poles' is defined before use.\n\n### Errors in Fuel Management\n- Regularly check your coal inventory to ensure that you have enough to refuel boilers and maintain continuous operation of the steam engine.\n\n### Assertion Errors\n- Ensure that the steam engine and other entities are functioning correctly by checking their status and resolving any issues that prevent them from working."}
