This will prevent failures due to missing items.\n\n### Errors when Connecting Pipes\n- Verify that the target location for pipe placement is not blocked by other entities. Clear any obstructions before attempting to connect pipes.\n\n### Errors with Inserters and Labs Not Receiving Power\n- Check that all components in the power network are correctly connected and that there are no missing connections. Ensure that the power source is active and capable of supplying power to the network."}
