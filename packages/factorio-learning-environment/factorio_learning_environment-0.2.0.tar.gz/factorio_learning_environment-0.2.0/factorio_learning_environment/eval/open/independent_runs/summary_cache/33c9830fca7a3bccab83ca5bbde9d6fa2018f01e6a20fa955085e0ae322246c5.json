{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0) with fuel inventory of coal and smelting iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter 1** at position (1.5, 0.5) transferring iron plates from the furnace to a wooden chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (2.5, 0.5) storing iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter 2** at position (3.5, 0.5) extracting items from the wooden chest and placing them onto a transport belt.\n- **Transport Belt Group** connecting the output of Burner Inserter 2 to Burner Inserter 3, consisting of belts from (3.5, 0.5) to (6.5, 0.5).\n- **Burner Inserter 3** at position (6.5, 0.5) transferring items from the transport belt to another wooden chest.\n- **End Wooden Chest** at position (7.5, 0.5) collecting iron plates from the transport belt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Ensure the target tile is clear of other entities before placing a new entity. Consider increasing spacing, changing direction, or selecting a different reference position.\n\n### Errors when connecting belts to non-belt entities\n- Belts cannot be directly connected to non-belt entities like chests. Use an inserter to transfer items from a chest to a belt.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient inventory items\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to place or craft entities. For example, gather wood before crafting a wooden chest.\n\n### Errors when crafting without necessary raw materials\n- Raw materials like wood must be gathered manually as they cannot be crafted. Ensure you have gathered enough raw materials before attempting to craft items that require them."}
