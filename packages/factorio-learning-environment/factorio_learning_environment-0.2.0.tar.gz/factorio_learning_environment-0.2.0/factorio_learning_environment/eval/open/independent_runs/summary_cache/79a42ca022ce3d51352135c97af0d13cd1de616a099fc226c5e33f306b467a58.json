{"content": "# Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nCurrently, there are no structures on the map. All attempts to place entities have failed, resulting in no entities being successfully placed.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure the target tile is unoccupied before attempting to place an entity. Multiple attempts to place entities such as Wooden Chests, Stone Furnaces, ore inserters, plate inserters, and output chests have failed due to occupied tiles.\n\n### Errors related to movement\n- When using the `move_to` function, ensure that the position argument is correctly formatted as an integer index. Errors such as \"string indices must be integers, not 'str'\" and \"'Position' object is not callable\" indicate incorrect usage of position data.\n\n### Errors with building box size\n- When attempting to clear an area for building, ensure that the BuildingBox size is appropriate for the available space. If no viable place is found, consider decreasing the size of the BuildingBox or using multiple smaller BuildingBoxes.\n\n### General placement errors\n- Double-check the coordinates and ensure they are within the bounds of the map and not overlapping with existing structures or entities."}
