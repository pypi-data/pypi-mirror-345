{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-46.5, -119.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-47.5, -123.5)\n- Boiler at position (-46.5, -119.0)\n- Steam Engine at position (-40.5, -113.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting the Offshore Pump to the Boiler\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -76.0) and Wooden Chest at position (-15.5, -77.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (9.0, -64.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (6.0, -62.0)\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) transferring items from Wooden Chest at position (7.5, -61.5) to Stone Furnace at position (6.0, -62.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (6.5, -59.5) storing Iron Plates\n\n### Lab at Position (6.5, -57.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab at position (6.5, -57.5) connected to the power source\n- Electricity Group connecting the Lab to the power source at position (-40.5, -113.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure that the pipe connections are correctly aligned and that there are no obstructions between the connecting entities. Verify the starting and ending positions of the pipes to ensure they are within reach and can form a continuous path.\n\n### Errors when Using Extracting but Being Too Far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when Placing into a Tile Which is Occupied by Another Entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity on a tile before attempting placement. Check for any existing entities that might occupy the desired tile."}
