{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -49.0) used for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Coal Mining and Transport System at Position (42.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (42.0, -83.0) for extracting coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (42.5, -81.5) for transferring coal from the mining drill to the transport belt.\n- BeltGroup connecting the entities:\n  - Transport Belt from (42.5, -82.5) to (44.5, -82.5) moving coal rightward.\n  - Transport Belt from (43.5, -81.5) to (43.5, -79.5) moving coal downward.\n  - Transport Belt from (43.5, -80.5) to (42.5, -79.5) moving coal leftward.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities\n- Ensure there is no obstruction at the intended placement position before attempting to place an entity like a Wooden Chest or extending a Transport Belt.\n\n### Errors with Transport Belt Connectivity\n- Verify that transport belts are correctly aligned and connected to ensure smooth item flow.\n\n### Errors with Output Blockage\n- Ensure there is a sink entity available to accept the output from entities like the Burner Mining Drill to prevent blockage.\n\n### Errors with Full Output\n- Regularly check and clear the output of entities like the Stone Furnace to prevent production halts due to full output inventory."}
