{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0) fueled with coal, smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (1.5, 0.5) transferring iron plates from the furnace to a wooden chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (2.5, 0.5) storing iron plates from the furnace.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (3.5, 0.5) extracting iron plates from the wooden chest and placing them onto a transport belt.\n- **Transport Belt** (BeltGroup) connecting positions (3.5, 0.5) to (6.5, 0.5) transporting iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (6.5, 0.5) transferring iron plates from the transport belt to another wooden chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (7.5, 0.5) collecting iron plates from the transport belt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Ensure that the target tile is free before placing an entity. Adjust spacing or change the direction if necessary to avoid overlap with existing entities.\n\n### Errors when attempting to connect belts directly from a chest\n- Use an inserter to extract items from a chest before attempting to connect them to a transport belt. Belts cannot be directly connected to chests.\n\n### Errors due to lack of resources in inventory\n- Ensure that you have the necessary resources in your inventory before attempting to craft or place items. Gather required resources like wood before crafting items that depend on them.\n\n### Errors when inserting items without inventory stock\n- Verify that you have the items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. Plan resource collection accordingly to maintain a steady supply."}
