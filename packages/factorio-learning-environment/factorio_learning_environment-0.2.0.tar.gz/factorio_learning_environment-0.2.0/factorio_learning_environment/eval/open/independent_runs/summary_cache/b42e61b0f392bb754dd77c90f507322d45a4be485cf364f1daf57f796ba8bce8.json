{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-0.5, -9.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam engine (position -0.5, -9.5) \n- Boiler (position -4.5, 23.0)\n- Offshore pump (position -10.5, 25.5)\n- Small electric poles (various positions for power distribution)\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 0, 0) and a furnace (position 0, 0)\n- Burner mining drill (position 5, 5) and a furnace (position 5, 5)\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 0, 0) and a furnace (position 0, 0)\n- Assembling machine (position z1) and inserter (position a) that puts into assembling machine\n- Beltgroup (position) that connects the furnace at position y1 to assembling machine at position(z1)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to connection issues\n- Ensure that there are no obstructions (like pipes) when attempting to connect the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine. Check the surrounding area for any misplaced objects.\n- Verify that the entities you are trying to connect are within the correct range and orientation for connection.\n\n### Errors when using electric networks\n- Make sure that all electric poles are properly connected to the electric network. If any pole is not connected, it can lead to entities being unpowered.\n- Check the status of the electric network and ensure that all entities requiring power are connected to it.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it. If the tile is occupied, you will need to remove the existing entity first."}
