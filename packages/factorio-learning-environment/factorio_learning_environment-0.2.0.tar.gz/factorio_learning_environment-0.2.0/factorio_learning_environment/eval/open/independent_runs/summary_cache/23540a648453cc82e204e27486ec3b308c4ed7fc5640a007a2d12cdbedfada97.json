{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n--------------------\nNo structures have been successfully established on the map. Multiple attempts were made to create a Lab facility at position (0.5, 2.5) for supplying Automation Science Packs toward research, but none resulted in a persistent placement. No other composite structures were created during these steps.\n\nERROR TIPS\n----------\n\u2022 Errors with get_entities API usage  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u2013 When retrieving entities, use the proper signature. Avoid supplying unexpected keyword arguments (such as \u201cradius\u201d) or extra positional parameters. Verify the function\u2019s expected parameters before invoking it.\n\n\u2022 Lab placement and inventory validation  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u2013 Before attempting to place a Lab at a designated position, confirm that a Lab exists in the inventory. This will prevent errors when attempting to place an entity that is not available.\n\n\u2022 Handling non\u2010iterable results  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u2013 Check that the value returned from get_entities (or similar API calls) is not None before iterating over it. Implement appropriate fallbacks (e.g., an empty list) to avoid \u201cNoneType not iterable\u201d errors.\n\n\u2022 Resource chain issues during Lab crafting  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u2013 Ensure that all required sub-ingredients (for example, iron-gear-wheels, electronic circuits, and copper cables) are producible with the available processes. Verifying the entire recipe dependency chain and confirming resource availability can help prevent crafting failures."}
