{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=1.5, y=23.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\n- Pipe connections between the boiler and steam engine, with various pipes at positions such as (x=16.5, y=17.5), (x=17.5, y=17.5), etc.\n- PipeGroup for fluid system 10835 at position (x=3.5, y=17.5) with pipes extending to (x=10.5, y=21.5)\n- PipeGroup for fluid system 10846 at position (x=-9.5, y=23.5) with pipes extending to (x=-0.5, y=23.5)\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at positions such as (x=24.5, y=22.5), (x=16.5, y=24.5), etc.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors when connecting pipes\n- Ensure that the pipes are correctly aligned and connected between entities. Verify that the entities you are trying to connect are compatible and within reach of the pipe connections.\n\n### Errors due to missing input liquid in steam engine\n- Check that the steam engine is properly connected to a source of water and that the fluid system is correctly set up to deliver water to the steam engine.\n\n### Errors due to boiler running out of fuel\n- Regularly refuel the boiler to ensure continuous operation. Monitor fuel levels and automate refueling if possible.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - `connect_entities(boiler, steam_engine, {Prototype.Pipe, Prototype.UndergroundPipe})`: Attempts to connect a boiler to a steam engine using specified pipe prototypes. Failed due to connection issues between the boiler and steam engine.\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `pipes`: List of pipe entities intended to connect the boiler and steam engine.\n  - `fluid_systems`: List of fluid systems managing the flow of water and steam within the structures.\n  - `Inventory`: Current inventory includes items like 'pipe', 'pipe-to-ground', 'boiler', 'burner-mining-drill', etc."}
