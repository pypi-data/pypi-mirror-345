Verify the prototype exists and is correctly referenced.\n- Check that the chest contains the items you are attempting to extract, and the quantity is available.\n\n### Attribute Errors\n- Avoid using incorrect attributes or methods on objects. Double-check the object type and its available methods or attributes before calling them.\n\n### Name Errors\n- Ensure that all variables and functions are defined before use. Verify the correct spelling and case of variable names, and ensure they are declared in the scope where they are used.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source items are available for inserters to pick up. Verify that the upstream processes are supplying the necessary items to the inserters.\n\n### Furnaces Missing Ingredients\n- Make sure that furnaces have the required ingredients to smelt. Check the supply chain leading to the furnaces to ensure they are being fed the correct materials.\n\n### Errors when Placing into a Tile which is Occupied by Another Entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing. Check for existing objects that might obstruct the placement.\n\n### Extraction Failures\n- Investigate reasons for extraction failures from chests, such as incorrect item types or insufficient quantities. Ensure the extraction logic is correctly implemented and the items are accessible."}
