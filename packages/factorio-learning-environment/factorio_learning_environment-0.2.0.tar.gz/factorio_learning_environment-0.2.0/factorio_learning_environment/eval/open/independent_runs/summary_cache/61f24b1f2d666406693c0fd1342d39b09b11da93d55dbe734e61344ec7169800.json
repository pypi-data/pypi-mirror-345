{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Coal Mine at position (41.0, -86.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (41.0, -86.0)\n- Burner mining drill at position (43.0, -86.0)\n- Wooden chest at position (43.5, -84.5)\n- Wooden chest at position (41.5, -82.5)\n- Wooden chest at position (41.5, -79.5)\n- Stone furnace at position (43.0, -79.0)\n- Wooden chest at position (43.5, -76.5)\n\n#### Iron Ore Mine at position (-17.0, -52.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (-17.0, -52.0)\n- Wooden chest at position (-16.5, -50.5)\n- Stone furnace at position (-15.0, -51.0)\n- Stone furnace at position (-13.0, -50.0)\n- Wooden chest at position (-13.5, -51.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when inserting items into a full inventory\n- Ensure the inventory of the target entity (e.g., furnace) has space before attempting to insert items. Check the inventory capacity and current item count.\n\n#### Errors when extracting items from an empty inventory\n- Verify that the source entity (e.g., furnace or chest) contains the items you are trying to extract before attempting to extract them.\n\n#### Errors due to full chests at drop positions\n- Regularly empty chests at drop positions for mining drills to ensure continuous mining operations. Monitor chest inventory levels and clear them as needed.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n#### Utility Functions\n- `extract_item(Prototype, Entity, quantity)`: Extracts items from an entity. Fails if the entity's inventory is empty or if the quantity is invalid.\n- `insert_item(Prototype, Entity, quantity)`: Inserts items into an entity. Fails if the entity's inventory is full or if the quantity is invalid.\n\n#### Important Variables\n- `coal`: Integer, represents the amount of coal in the inventory.\n- `iron_ore`: Integer, represents the amount of iron ore in the inventory.\n- `iron_plate`: Integer, represents the amount of iron plates in the inventory."}
