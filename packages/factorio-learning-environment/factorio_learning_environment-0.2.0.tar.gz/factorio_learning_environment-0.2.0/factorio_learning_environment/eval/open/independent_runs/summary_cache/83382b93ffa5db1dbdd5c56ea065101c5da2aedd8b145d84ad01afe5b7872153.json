{"content": "# Factorio Game Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Iron Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) fueled by coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (1.5, 0.5) supplying items to the furnace.\n- Wooden Chest at position (2.5, 0.5) used for storing iron plates.\n- Transport Belt at position (4.5, 0.5) functioning properly to move items.\n- Burner Inserter at position (3.5, 0.5) waiting for source items, connected to the transport belt.\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Copper Furnace at position (10.0, 0.0) fueled by coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (11.5, 0.5) supplying items to the furnace.\n- Wooden Chest at position (12.5, 0.5) used for storing copper plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (8.5, 0.5) supplying items to the furnace from the chest.\n\n### Coal Mining Operation\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) working and fueled by coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (40.5, -83.5) for storing mined coal.\n- Transport Belt connecting the mining drill to the chest.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using inserters without valid source entities\n- Ensure that the inserter has a valid source entity to extract items from before placing or using it. Check the position and availability of source entities.\n\n### Errors when extracting items from transport belts\n- Verify the presence of the correct items on the transport belt before attempting to extract them. Ensure that the transport belt is functioning and contains the expected items.\n\n### Errors when attempting to get entities from specific positions\n- Confirm the existence of entities at specified positions before attempting to interact with them. Double-check the coordinates and entity types to avoid errors."}
