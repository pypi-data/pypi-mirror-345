{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0), extracting iron ore and dropping it into a chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5), storing extracted iron ore and iron plates.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-15.5, y=-48.5), additional storage for extracted materials.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0), intended for smelting iron ore into iron plates but currently not producing due to lack of ingredients.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5), transferring items between chests.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when extracting items from non-existent or empty entities\n- Ensure that the target entity exists and contains the items you intend to extract before attempting extraction.\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied or invalid tiles\n- Before placing an entity, check that the target tile is unoccupied and suitable for the entity type. Consider adjusting spacing, direction, or reference position to avoid collisions.\n\n### Errors due to lack of ingredients in processing facilities\n- Regularly check and ensure that processing facilities like furnaces have the necessary ingredients to function. Refill or supply them with required materials to maintain production.\n\n### Errors when attempting to place entities with incorrect spacing or direction\n- Adjust the spacing and direction parameters when placing entities to ensure they do not overlap with existing structures or entities. Consider the surrounding environment and adjust accordingly."}
