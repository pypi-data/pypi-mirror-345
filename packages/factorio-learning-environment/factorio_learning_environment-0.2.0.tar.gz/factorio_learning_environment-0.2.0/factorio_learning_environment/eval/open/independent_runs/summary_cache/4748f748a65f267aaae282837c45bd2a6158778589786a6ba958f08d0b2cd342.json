{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) with a wooden chest at position (52.5, -84.5) for coal storage.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-25.0, -64.0) connected to a belt group starting at position (-25.5, -65.5) for transporting iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -65.0) with a burner inserter at position (-17.5, -64.5) transferring iron plates to a wooden chest at position (-16.5, -64.5).\n\n### Iron Ore Mining at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) with a wooden chest at position (-14.5, -54.5) for iron ore storage.\n\n### Iron Plate Smelting Facility at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with a burner inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) transferring items to a wooden chest at position (1.5, 0.5).\n\n### Belt Networks\n- Belt group connecting various positions for item transportation, including:\n  - From (-26.5, -65.5) to (-22.5, -65.5)\n  - From (-23.5, -64.5) to (-21.5, -64.5)\n  - From (-20.5, -64.5) to (-20.5, -66.5)\n  - From (-14.5, -63.5) to (-14.5, -65.5)\n  - Extensive network from (-18.5, -63.5) to (-12.5, -58.5)\n  - From (-14.5, -54.5) to (-17.5, -59.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors When Inserting Items Without Available Inventory\n- Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into machines or structures. For example, attempting to insert coal when none is available in the inventory will result in an error.\n\n### Errors When Furnaces Have No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Regularly check and ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to process. If a furnace is showing \"no ingredients to smelt,\" verify the input supply chain and ensure it is functioning correctly.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Fuel in Mining Drills\n- Monitor fuel levels in mining drills to prevent them from running out of fuel. Regular refueling is necessary to maintain continuous operation."}
