# mpstop

*Pronounced "em-pee-ess-top" (like 'MPS' + 'top')*

**mpstop** is a minimal, fast, and user-friendly system monitor for Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3) Macs. Inspired by tools like htop and nvitop, mpstop gives you a real-time, terminal-based view of your Mac's GPU (MPS), CPU, memory, and Python process usage. Perfect for developers, researchers, and anyone who wants to keep an eye on their Mac's performance.
