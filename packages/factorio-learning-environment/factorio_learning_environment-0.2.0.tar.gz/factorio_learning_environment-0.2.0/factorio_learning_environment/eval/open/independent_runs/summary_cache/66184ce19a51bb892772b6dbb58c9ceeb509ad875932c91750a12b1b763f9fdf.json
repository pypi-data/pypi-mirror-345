{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\n  - Refueled with coal.\n  - Warnings: Chest at drop position is full. Empty the chest at (-14.5, -48.5) to continue mining.\n- **Wooden Chest** at Position (-15.5, -48.5)\n  - Used to increase storage capacity.\n- **Wooden Chest** at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\n  - Contains iron ore and iron plates.\n- **Stone Furnace** at Position (-12.0, -48.0)\n  - Refueled with coal.\n  - Processes iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at Position (-14.5, -47.5)\n  - Transfers items between chests.\n  - Refueled with coal.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Extracting Items\n- Ensure the target chest contains the specified items before attempting to extract. Check for the presence of iron plates in the wooden chest before extraction.\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities\n- Ensure the target tile is unoccupied before placing a new entity. Consider increasing spacing or changing direction/reference position if an entity already exists at the intended location.\n- Avoid placing entities where there might be collisions with existing entities or unsuitable terrain (e.g., water).\n\n### Errors when Refueling and Processing\n- Ensure the furnace is adequately refueled and supplied with sufficient raw materials to produce the desired output. Check the furnace's inventory and fuel levels regularly to avoid production halts."}
