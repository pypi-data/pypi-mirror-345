{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (52.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (52.0, -82.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (53.5, -80.5).\n- Burner Inserter at position (52.5, -79.5) transferring coal from the Wooden Chest at position (53.5, -80.5) to another Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -78.5).\n- A second Burner Inserter at position (52.5, -76.5) is waiting for source items to transfer from the Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -77.5).\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-12.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-12.0, -51.0) dropping iron ore into a Wooden Chest at position (-11.5, -49.5).\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) processing iron ore from the Wooden Chest at position (-11.5, -49.5).\n- Burner Inserter at position (-11.5, -48.5) waiting for source items to transfer from the Wooden Chest at position (-11.5, -49.5).\n- Additional Burner Inserters at positions (-8.5, -48.5) and (-13.5, -46.5) are also waiting for source items.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entities (e.g., chests or belts) are not empty and are correctly supplying items to the inserters. Check for blockages or missing items in the supply chain to prevent inserters from idling.\n\n### Chest Full Warning\n- Regularly empty the chest at position (-11.5, -49.5) to allow the Burner Mining Drill at position (-12.0, -51.0) to continue mining without interruptions.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the current inventory of items such as 'wooden-chest', 'wood', 'coal', 'iron-ore', and 'iron-plate'. Current values are {'wooden-chest': 3, 'wood': 10, 'coal': 1140, 'iron-ore': 1597, 'iron-plate': 1406}."}
