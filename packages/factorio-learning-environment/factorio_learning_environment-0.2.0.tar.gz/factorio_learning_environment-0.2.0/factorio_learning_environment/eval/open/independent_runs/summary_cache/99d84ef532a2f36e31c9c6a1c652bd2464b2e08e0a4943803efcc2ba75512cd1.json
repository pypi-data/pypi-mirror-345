{"content": "## Report\n\n### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\n- **Iron Ore Extraction Site**\n  - Burner Mining Drill at position (4.0, -60.0) extracting iron ore.\n  - Connected to a wooden chest at position (4.5, -58.5) which stores extracted iron ore.\n\n- **Iron Ore Storage**\n  - Iron Chest at position (-5.5, -50.5) storing iron ore and iron plates.\n\n- **Iron Plate Production Line**\n  - Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -48.0) with a full output of iron plates.\n  - Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0) with a full output of iron plates.\n  - Stone Furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0) with a full output of iron plates.\n  - Each furnace is supplied with coal as fuel and iron ore as input.\n\n#### Storage Facilities\n- Multiple Wooden Chests at various positions (e.g., 5.5, -60.5; 7.5, -60.5; 6.5, -60.5; etc.) used for storing various resources including iron plates and iron ore.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors with Full Output and Storage\n- **Furnace Output Full**: Ensure that the output of furnaces is regularly cleared to prevent production halts. Consider using inserters to automate the transfer of iron plates from furnaces to storage chests.\n- **Chest Full Warnings**: Regularly monitor and empty chests that are full to maintain continuous operation of mining drills and furnaces. Automate the transfer of items from full chests to prevent bottlenecks.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n#### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided steps.\n\n#### Important Variables\n- `iron_ore`: int - Represents the amount of iron ore extracted and stored.\n- `iron_plate`: int - Represents the amount of iron plates produced and stored.\n- `coal`: int - Represents the amount of coal used as fuel for furnaces and mining drills."}
