{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-46.5, -121.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (-41.5, y=-117.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting these entities\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at Position (-19.0, -73.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-19.0, -73.0)\n\n### Iron Plate Mine at Position (9.0, -64.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0)\n\n### Additional Structures\n- Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0)\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) connected to a small electric pole and a wooden chest\n- Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (6.5, -59.5)\n- Lab with no power\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Pipes\n- Ensure there is no obstruction at the target position before attempting to place a pipe. Remove any existing entities that might block the placement.\n\n### Steam Engine Not Generating Power\n- Verify that the steam engine is properly connected to a power network and that it has the necessary input liquid to generate power. Check connections and ensure the fluid system is operational.\n\n### Errors with Unpowered Entities\n- Make sure all entities requiring power, such as inserters and labs, are connected to a power source. Check the connections to the power network and ensure there is no break in the electricity supply.\n\n### Errors with Fluid Connections\n- Ensure that all fluid connections are properly established and that there are no warnings such as \"no input liquid\" or \"no fluid present in connections.\" Check the fluid systems and connections for any issues."}
