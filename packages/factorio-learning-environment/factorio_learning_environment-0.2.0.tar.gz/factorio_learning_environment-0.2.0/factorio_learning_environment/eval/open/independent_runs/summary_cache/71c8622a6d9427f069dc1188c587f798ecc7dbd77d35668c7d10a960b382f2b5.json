{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining Complex at position(x=37-41, y=-83 to -87)\nComplex mining setup consisting of:\n- 4 Burner mining drills at positions (37.0,-85.0), (39.0,-85.0), (41.0,-86.0), (41.0,-83.0)\n- 4 Wooden chests collecting coal at positions (34.5,-86.5), (36.5,-86.5), (40.5,-87.5), (39.5,-83.5)\n- Burner inserters connecting the components at positions (35.5,-86.5), (35.5,-85.5)\n\n### Iron/Copper Ore Mining & Smelting at position(x=-28, y=-61)\nMining and smelting setup with:\n- Burner mining drill at (-28.0,-61.0) mining iron and copper ore\n- Stone furnace at (-27.0,-58.0) for smelting\n- Wooden chest at (-27.5,-59.5) collecting ores\n- Burner inserters at (-26.5,-59.5), (-25.5,-58.5) moving materials\n- Additional furnaces at (-23.0,-58.0), (-21.0,-58.0) with associated inserters\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Complex at position(x=-6 to -10, y=-59)\nLarge iron mining setup with:\n- 3 Burner mining drills at (-10.0,-59.0), (-8.0,-59.0), (-6.0,-59.0)\n- Multiple wooden chests and inserters for ore collection\n- Transport belt system connecting components\n\n### Smelting Line at position(x=0 to 6, y=0)\nOrganized smelting array consisting of:\n- 4 Stone furnaces at (0.0,0.0), (2.0,0.0), (4.0,0.0), (6.0,0.0)\n- Input inserters and chests above furnaces\n- Output inserters and chests below furnaces\n- Transport belt system for material movement\n\n### Power Generation System at position(x=4.5, y=20.5)\nPower generation setup with:\n- Steam engine at (4.5,20.5)\n- Boiler at (-1.5,22.0)\n- Offshore pump at (-3.5,27.5)\n- Pipe network connecting components\n- Small electric poles creating electricity network\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Extraction errors\n- Cannot extract from empty or non-existent containers\n- Ensure target chest exists and contains the requested items before attempting extraction\n\n### Entity placement conflicts\n- Check if target position is clear before placing new entities\n- Remove existing entities if they occupy needed space\n\n### Fluid system issues\n- Steam engine shows \"no input liquid\" warning - ensure proper pipe connections\n- Boiler needs fuel to heat water - keep fuel supply maintained\n\n### Inserter optimization\n- Multiple inserters showing \"waiting for source items\" - ensure proper supply chain\n- Some inserters blocked by full destination containers - manage container capacity\n\n### Belt system efficiency\n- Multiple empty belt groups detected - ensure proper input supply\n- Check belt connections and directions match intended material flow"}
