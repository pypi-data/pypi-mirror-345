Use an inserter to feed items into the steam engine instead.\n\u2013 For placement errors due to excessive distance, ensure the player moves closer to the intended position so that the distance does not exceed the allowed maximum.\n\u2013 When an entity cannot be placed because it is missing from the inventory (e.g. \u201cNo wooden_chest in inventory\u201d), verify and manage the inventory to include the required item before placing.\n\u2013 In cases of variable name errors (e.g. \u201cNameError: name 'target_chest' is not defined\u201d), double\u2010check that the correct and defined variable names (such as target_pos or depot_chest) are being used."}
