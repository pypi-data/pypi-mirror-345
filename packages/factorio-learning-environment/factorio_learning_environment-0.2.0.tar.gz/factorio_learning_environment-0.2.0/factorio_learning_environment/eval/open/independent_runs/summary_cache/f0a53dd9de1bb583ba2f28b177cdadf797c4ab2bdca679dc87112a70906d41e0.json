{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Electricity generator at position(x=117.5, y=-30.5)\nConsists of steam engine(position x=117.5, y=-30.5), boiler(position x=111.5, y=-32.0), offshore pump(position x=106.5, y=-32.5) and small-electric-pole(position x=111.5, y=-30.5)\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(x=41.0, y=-82.0)\nConsists of following entities\n-  Burner mining drill (position x=41.0, y=-82.0) and a furnace at position(x=41.0, y=-80.0)\n-  Burner inserter (position x=39.5, y=-79.5) that puts into furnace at position(x=41.0, y=-80.0)\n-  Belt group (position x=40.5, y=-83.5) that connects the furnace at position(x=41.0, y=-80.0) to burner mining drill at position(x=41.0, y=-82.0)\n\n### Copper cable factory\nNo copper cable factory structure found\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n### Errors when using connect_entities but being given incorrect position type\n-  Make sure to pass the correct position type to the connect_entities function. The function expects a position object, not a float or other type.\n\n### Errors when using get_entity but being given a position object with a position attribute\n-  Make sure to access the position attribute of the position object correctly. The position object has a position attribute, but it should be accessed as a simple attribute, not as a nested attribute.\n\n### Errors when using burner entities but being out of fuel\n-  Make sure to provide fuel to the burner entities. The burner entities are currently out of fuel, which is causing them to not function correctly.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n*   connect_entities: function that connects two entities with a pipe\n    *   Failure modes: incorrect position type, position object with a position attribute\n    *   Success modes: correct connection of two entities with a pipe\n*   get_entity: function that gets an entity at a specific position\n    *   Failure modes: incorrect position object\n    *   Success modes: correct retrieval of an entity at a specific position\n*   Important variables:\n    *   offshore_pump_pos: position of the offshore pump\n    *   boiler_pos: position of the boiler\n    *   steam_engine: steam engine entity\n    *   burner_inserter: burner inserter entity\n    *   furnace: furnace entity\n    *   burner_mining_drill: burner mining drill entity\n    *   small_electric_pole: small electric pole entity\n    *   pipe: pipe entity\n    *   pipe_group: pipe group entity\n    *   belt_group: belt group entity\n    *   electricity_group: electricity group entity"}
