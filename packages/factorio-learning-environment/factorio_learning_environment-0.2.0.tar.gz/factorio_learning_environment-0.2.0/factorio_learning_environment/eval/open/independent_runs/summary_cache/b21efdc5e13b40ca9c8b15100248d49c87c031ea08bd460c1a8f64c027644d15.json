{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Group at position (x=52.5, y=49.0) and (x=52.5, y=54.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- ElectricityGroup (id=226118) with poles at positions:\n  - (x=51.5, y=54.5)\n  - (x=52.5, y=54.5)\n  - (x=53.5, y=54.5)\n  - ... (additional poles omitted for brevity)\n\n### Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\nConsists of:\n- OffshorePump (name='offshore-pump', direction=Direction.UP, position=(-9.5, 24.5), status=EntityStatus.WORKING)\n- Connected to pipes at positions:\n  - (x=-9.5, y=22.5)\n  - (x=-9.5, y=23.5)\n\n### Pipe Group at position (x=5.5, y=5.5)\nConsists of:\n- PipeGroup (fluid_system=83911, fluid=water, status=EntityStatus.WORKING) with pipes at various positions including:\n  - (x=5.5, y=5.5)\n  - (x=4.5, y=5.5)\n  - (x=7.5, y=5.5)\n  - ... (additional pipes omitted for brevity)\n\n### Furnace at position (1.0, 1.0)\nConsists of:\n- Furnace (name='stone-furnace', direction=Direction.UP, position=(1.0, 1.0), status=EntityStatus.NO_INGREDIENTS)\n\n### Lab at position (6.5, 1.5)\nConsists of:\n- Lab (status=EntityStatus.NO_POWER, research=automation)\n\n### Error Tips\n\n### Errors when placing electric poles\n- Ensure that the target location for placing electric poles is free of obstructions. If the area is blocked by entities or terrain (e.g., water), the pole cannot be placed.\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities\n- Verify that the specified position actually contains the entity type you are trying to retrieve. For example, if trying to get a steam engine, ensure that there is indeed a steam engine at that position.\n\n### Errors when checking for water\n- When checking for resources like water, ensure that the specified coordinates are indeed within a water body. If no water is present at the specified location, the operation will fail.\n\n### Repeated Errors\n- The errors regarding the inability to place electric poles and retrieve the steam engine at position (10.0, 0.0) have occurred multiple times. Ensure to check the environment and entity presence before attempting these actions."}
