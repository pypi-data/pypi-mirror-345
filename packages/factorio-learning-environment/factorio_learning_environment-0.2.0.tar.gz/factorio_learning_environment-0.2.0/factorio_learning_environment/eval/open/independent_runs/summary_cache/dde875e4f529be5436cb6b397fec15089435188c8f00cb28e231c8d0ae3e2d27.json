For example, use 'burner_inserter' instead of 'BurnerInserter'.\n\n### Errors with entity status checks\n- Verify that the entity status you are checking is valid and correctly spelled. Ensure that the entity is correctly instantiated and available in the scope.\n\n### Errors with inventory extraction\n- Confirm that the target inventory is accessible and contains the items you intend to extract. Ensure the entity is not blocked or empty before attempting extraction.\n\n### Errors with belt blockages\n- Regularly check and clear blockages on belts to ensure smooth operation. Make sure that the belts are correctly connected and have space for items to move."}
