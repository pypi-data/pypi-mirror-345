{"content": "# FACTORIO REPORT\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System at Position(-11.5, 69.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position(-11.5, 69.5)\n- Boiler at position(-6.0, 71.5)\n- Steam engine at position(-0.5, 75.5)\n- Connected by pipe groups for water and steam\nThe system is operational with the steam engine working, though the boiler currently has no fuel.\n\n### Iron Mining Operation at Position(27.5, 85.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill 1 at position(27.5, 85.5)\n- Electric mining drill 2 at position(30.5, 85.5)\n- Small electric pole at position(29.5, 83.5)\n- Transport belt system connecting the drills\nBoth drills are operational but currently waiting for space in destination as the belts are blocked.\n\n### Transport Belt Network\nConsists of multiple belt groups:\n- Output belt from drill 1 at position(27.5, 87.5) extending right\n- Output belt from drill 2 at position(30.5, 87.5) extending right\n- Merge belt at position(32.5, 87.5) extending downward\n- Main transport line extending from position(32.5, 93.5) to position(39.5, 94.5)\nThe belt system is designed to transport iron ore from the mining drills to the furnace area.\n\n### Iron Smelting Area\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace 1 at position(39.0, 96.0) with coal fuel\n- Stone furnace 2 at position(43.0, 95.0) with coal fuel\n- Burner inserter at position(39.5, 97.5) for furnace 1\n- Burner inserter at position(43.5, 96.5) for furnace 2\n- Input belt for furnaces at position(39.5, 98.5) extending right\nThe furnaces are fueled but currently have no ingredients to smelt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting entities that are too far apart\n- When connecting entities with belts or pipes, ensure there is a valid path between them\n- Example: Failed to connect transport belt from position(27.5, 87.5) to position(31.5, 87.5)\n- Example: Failed to connect transport belt from position(39.5, 94.5) to position(41.5, 98.5)\n- Use intermediate belts to create a valid path when connecting distant points\n\n### Errors when placing entities on invalid terrain\n- Check the terrain before placing entities to ensure it's not water or otherwise unplaceable\n- Example: Could not place stone-furnace at position(32.5, 93.5) and position(38.5, 94.5) due to water or other obstacles\n- Scout the area first to find suitable placement locations\n\n### Errors when connecting fluid entities\n- Ensure boilers and steam engines are properly connected with pipes\n- Example: Failed to connect boiler at position(-6.0, 71.5) to steam engine at position(-0.5, 75.5)\n- Make sure connection points are not blocked and are properly aligned\n\n### Errors with power connections\n- Some entities showed NO_POWER status because they weren't properly connected to the power network\n- Ensure electric poles are placed within range of all electrical devices\n- Create a continuous power network by placing poles at appropriate intervals"}
