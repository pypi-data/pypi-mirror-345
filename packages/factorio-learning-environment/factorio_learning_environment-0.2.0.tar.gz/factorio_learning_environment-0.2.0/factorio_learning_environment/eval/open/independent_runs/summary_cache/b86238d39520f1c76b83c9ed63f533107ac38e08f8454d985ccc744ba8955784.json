{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) with a drop position at (41.5, -80.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (43.0, -82.0)\n- Iron Chest at position (41.5, -80.5)\n- Iron Chest at position (42.5, -80.5)\n- Burner Inserter at position (43.5, -80.5) with a pickup position at (42.5, -80.5) and drop position at (44.5, -80.5)\n- Iron Chest at position (44.5, -80.5)\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) with a drop position at (-14.5, -48.5)\n- Iron Chest at position (-16.5, -48.5)\n- Iron Chest at position (-15.5, -48.5)\n- Iron Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0)\n\n### Iron Plate Storage and Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Multiple Iron Chests at positions (-16.5, -47.5), (-17.5, -47.5), (-14.5, -47.5), (-15.5, -47.5) for storage\n- Burner Inserters at positions (-12.5, -44.5), (-10.5, -44.5), (-8.5, -44.5) for transferring iron plates between chests\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Extracting Items from Chests\n- Ensure that the quantity of items to be extracted from a chest is greater than 0 before attempting extraction. This will prevent errors related to extracting items from a full or empty chest.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Check that the source items are available for inserters to pick up. If an inserter is waiting for source items, ensure the source inventory is not empty.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Running Out of Fuel\n- Regularly refuel inserters to prevent them from running out of fuel and stopping operations. This can be done by monitoring the fuel inventory of inserters and refueling them as needed."}
