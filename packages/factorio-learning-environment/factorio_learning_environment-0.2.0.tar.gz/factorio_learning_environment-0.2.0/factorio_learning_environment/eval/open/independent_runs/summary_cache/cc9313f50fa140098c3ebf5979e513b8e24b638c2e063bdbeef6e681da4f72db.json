{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (5 units)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Warnings: Output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Neighbours: Stone Furnace at Position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)\n  - Resources: Iron Ore (40,000 units)\n  - Drop Position: (x=-16.5, y=-52.5)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (14 units)\n  - Status: No Ingredients\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Furnace Result: Iron Plate (60 units)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure that the desired location for placing entities such as Wooden Chests, Burner Inserters, and Transport Belts is not already occupied by another entity or is a valid position.\n\n### Errors when moving entities\n- Verify that the target location for moving entities like Stone Furnaces is valid and unoccupied before attempting to move.\n\n### Errors when connecting belts\n- When connecting belts, ensure that the path is clear and that the belts can be connected to the intended entities. Use inserters to input items into entities like Stone Furnaces instead of connecting belts directly.\n\n### Errors due to missing entities\n- Before attempting to interact with an entity, confirm its presence at the specified location to avoid errors related to missing entities.\n\n### Warnings related to blocked outputs\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity like a chest or another processing unit to accept the output from drills or furnaces to prevent blockage warnings."}
