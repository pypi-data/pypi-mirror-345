{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-13.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnaces**:\n  - Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0) with iron ore input and iron plate output.\n  - Furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0) with iron ore input and iron plate output.\n  - Furnace at position (-9.0, -48.0) with iron ore input and iron plate output.\n- **Iron Chests**:\n  - Iron chest at position (-18.5, -48.5) storing iron ore.\n  - Iron chest at position (-16.5, -48.5) storing iron ore.\n  - Iron chest at position (-15.5, -48.5) storing iron ore.\n  - Wooden chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) storing iron ore.\n  - Iron chest at position (-13.5, -49.5) storing iron ore.\n\n### Coal Storage Facility at Position (45.5, -80.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Iron Chests**:\n  - Iron chest at position (45.5, -80.5) storing coal.\n  - Iron chest at position (47.5, -80.5) storing coal.\n  - Iron chest at position (49.5, -80.5) storing coal.\n\n### Mining and Smelting Setup at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill**:\n  - Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) extracting resources.\n- **Stone Furnace**:\n  - Furnace at position (43.0, -82.0) for smelting.\n- **Burner Inserters**:\n  - Inserter at position (41.5, -78.5) waiting for source items.\n  - Inserter at position (43.5, -80.5) transferring items between chests and furnaces.\n- **Iron Chests**:\n  - Iron chest at position (41.5, -80.5) storing coal and iron plates.\n  - Iron chest at position (42.5, -80.5) storing coal and iron plates.\n  - Iron chest at position (44.5, -80.5) storing coal and iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the supply chain is connected properly to provide source items to the inserters. Check the connected chests and ensure they contain the necessary resources.\n\n### Errors with Refueling and Clearing Drop Chests\n- Make sure that the drop chests for mining drills are cleared regularly to prevent them from becoming full. Ensure that the mining drills are refueled to continue operation.\n\n### Errors with Transferring Iron Ore\n- Ensure that there is sufficient iron ore in the inventory before attempting to transfer it to furnaces or chests. Check the inventory levels to avoid transfer failures.\n\n### Errors with Entity Placement and Resource Extraction\n- Verify that the target entity exists and contains the required resources before attempting extraction or placement actions. Ensure that the entities are not out of fuel or resources to maintain continuous operation."}
