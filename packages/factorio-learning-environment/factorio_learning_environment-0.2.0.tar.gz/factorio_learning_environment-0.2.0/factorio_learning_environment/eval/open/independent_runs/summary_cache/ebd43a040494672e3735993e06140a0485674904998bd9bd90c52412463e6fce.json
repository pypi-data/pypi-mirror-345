{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-14.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) with a burner inserter at position (-13.5, -47.5) feeding it iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-12.0, -48.0) with a burner inserter at position (-13.5, -47.5) feeding it iron ore.\n- Wooden chest at position (-13.5, -46.5) receiving iron plates from the burner inserter at position (-13.5, -47.5).\n- Transport belt group connecting the furnaces to the wooden chest.\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-7.0, 23.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (-3.5, 23.5).\n- Boiler at position (-7.0, 23.5).\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5).\n- Pipe group connecting the offshore pump to the boiler.\n- Electricity group with poles distributed across various positions for power distribution.\n\n### Iron Plate Transport System\nConsists of:\n- Belt group transporting iron plates from position (-11.5, -46.5) to position (-9.5, -46.5).\n- Belt group transporting items from position (-12.5, -44.5) to position (-11.5, -46.5).\n\n### Storage and Inserter System\nConsists of:\n- Wooden chest at position (-13.5, -44.5) storing iron plates.\n- Iron chest at position (-11.5, -44.5).\n- Multiple burner inserters positioned at (-13.5, -45.5), (-11.5, -45.5), and (-9.5, -44.5) for item movement.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Extracting Items\n- Ensure the target entity contains the items you want to extract before attempting extraction. Verify the entity's inventory status.\n\n### Errors when Inserting Items\n- Confirm that you have the items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. Check your inventory to ensure you have the required items.\n\n### Errors when Using Extracting but Being Too Far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when Placing into a Tile Occupied by Another Entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placement. Verify the tile is unoccupied."}
