{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (1.0, 1.0) and a Burner Inserter at position (1.5, -0.5) for extracting iron plates.\n- Stone Furnace at position (3.0, 1.0) and a Burner Inserter at position (3.5, -0.5) for extracting iron plates.\n\n### Iron Plate Transport System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Inserter at position (4.5, 1.5) connected to the Stone Furnace at position (3.0, 1.0).\n- Burner Inserter at position (5.5, 1.5) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (6.5, 1.5) for storing iron plates.\n\n### Belt Groups\n- BeltGroup with inputs at positions (x=-11.5, y=-50.5) and outputs at positions (x=-13.5, y=-52.5), consisting of 3 belts.\n- BeltGroup with inputs at positions (x=-12.5, y=-50.5) and outputs at positions (x=-11.5, y=-52.5), consisting of 5 belts.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors when trying to get or connect entities\n- Ensure the entity type exists at the specified position before attempting to get it. For example, make sure a transport belt exists at the intended position before calling `get_entity`.\n- When connecting entities, ensure the start and end positions are compatible with the entity type. For instance, transport belts cannot be directly connected to stone furnaces; use an inserter instead.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient inventory items\n- Ensure you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. For example, verify you have enough iron ore or coal before trying to insert them into a furnace or inserter."}
