{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report (Steps 8-15)\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at position (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump (position -9.5, -0.5)\n- Boiler (position -5.0, 2.5)\n- Steam engine (position 0.5, 6.5)\n- Connected with pipe network (positions -8.5,-0.5 to -5.5,0.5)\n- Small electric pole (position 0.5, 3.5)\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Operation at position (19.5, 74.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill (position 19.5, 74.5)\n- Wooden chest for ore collection (position 19.5, 76.5)\n- Two stone furnaces (positions 20.0, 78.0 and 23.0, 78.0)\n- Inserters (positions 21.5, 78.5 and 24.5, 78.5)\n- Output wooden chest (position 25.5, 78.5)\n- Connected with power poles (positions 10.5,45.5 to 31.5,46.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Persistent furnace input issues\n- Iron ore not reaching furnaces despite inserters being placed\n- Verify inserter orientation and pickup/drop positions\n- Check power connection to all inserters\n- Ensure chests have available ore and aren't blocked\n\n### Belt connection errors\n- Transport belts cannot connect directly to chests - must use inserters as intermediaries\n- When redesigning ore transport, always include inserters between chests and belts\n\n### Placement collision errors\n- Check for existing entities before placing new ones (wooden chests, mining drills)\n- Clear old entities completely before attempting new placements\n- Verify terrain is suitable (not water) before placing mining drills\n\n### Distance-related placement errors\n- Move within 10 tiles of target position before placing entities\n- Plan operations in local areas rather than trying to place entities far from current position\n\n### Resource location errors\n- Verify iron ore patches exist at target coordinates before attempting to mine\n- Use get_resource_patch only on confirmed ore locations\n\n### Power system issues\n- Monitor boiler fuel levels to maintain consistent power generation\n- Check power pole network coverage when adding new machines\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Important Variables\n- iron_patch: Position | None - Stores location of iron ore resources\n- drill: Entity - Reference to mining drill entity\n- furnace: Entity - Reference to smelting furnace entity\n- output_chest: Entity - Reference to output storage chest\n- belt: Entity - Reference to transport belt entity"}
