{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Two stone furnaces at positions (-14.0, -49.0) and (-12.0, -48.0) with burner inserters at positions (-13.5, -47.5) and (-14.5, -45.5) feeding into chests at positions (-13.5, -46.5) and (-13.5, -44.5).\n- Transport belts connecting the furnaces and chests, facilitating the movement of iron plates.\n- Multiple wooden chests storing iron plates at positions (-13.5, -46.5), (-11.5, -46.5), (-13.5, -44.5), (-9.5, -43.5), and (-7.5, -43.5).\n\n### Electricity Generation Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore pump at position (-10.5, 25.5) supplying water.\n- Boilers at positions (-9.5, 22.0), (-3.5, 22.0), (0.5, 22.0), and (1.5, 18.0) which are currently not connected and have warnings for being out of fuel and lacking input liquid.\n- Pipes and pipe groups connecting various parts of the setup, although some are empty or improperly placed.\n\n### Transport Belt Network\nConsists of the following entities:\n- A belt group with inputs from position (-11.5, -46.5) to (-9.5, -46.5) and outputs from (-8.5, -45.5) to (-8.5, -43.5).\n- Additional belts facilitating movement of materials between different parts of the production facility.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities without having them in inventory\n- Ensure that the required entities are available in your inventory before attempting to place them on the map.\n\n### Errors in crafting due to missing raw materials\n- Gather all necessary raw materials, such as stone for crafting stone furnaces, before attempting to craft complex items like boilers.\n\n### Errors when connecting entities with pipes\n- Verify that the connection path is clear and that there are no obstacles or overlapping entities that might prevent successful connections.\n\n### Errors when placing entities on water or occupied tiles\n- Check the target tile for water or existing entities before placing new entities to avoid overlap and ensure successful placement.\n\n### Attribute Errors when using incorrect entity names\n- Double-check the entity names and attributes in the API to ensure correct usage, such as using 'PipeGroup' instead of 'PipeToGround'.\n\n### Errors due to unconnected boilers\n- Ensure that boilers are properly connected to a water source and have fuel to function effectively."}
