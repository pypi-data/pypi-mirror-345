{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-7.0, 23.5)\nConsists of:\n- Boiler at position (-7.0, 23.5)\n- Steam engine at position (-3.5, 23.5)\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe group connecting these entities\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Furnace 1 at position (-14.0, -49.0) with burner inserter at position (-13.5, -47.5)\n- Furnace 2 at position (-12.0, -48.0) with burner inserter at position (-13.5, -47.5)\n- Belt group connecting furnaces to an iron chest at position (-11.5, -44.5)\n\n### Transport Belt Network\n- Belt group running from position (-11.5, -46.5) to (-9.5, -46.5) and from (-8.5, -45.5) to (-8.5, -43.5)\n\n### Storage and Inserter System\n- Iron chest at position (-11.5, -44.5)\n- Multiple burner inserters positioned around the transport belt network and furnaces\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Blockage Issues\n- Ensure that inserters have a clear path to drop items into a valid destination. Check for any blockages or missing destination entities.\n\n### Extraction Errors from Furnaces\n- Verify that the furnace contains the items you intend to extract before attempting extraction. Ensure the furnace is operational and has the correct inventory.\n\n### Inserter Fuel Management\n- Regularly check the fuel levels of burner inserters to prevent them from running out of fuel, which can halt operations.\n\n### Inventory Management for Insertion\n- Ensure that your inventory contains the items you intend to insert into entities. Check inventory levels before attempting to insert items."}
