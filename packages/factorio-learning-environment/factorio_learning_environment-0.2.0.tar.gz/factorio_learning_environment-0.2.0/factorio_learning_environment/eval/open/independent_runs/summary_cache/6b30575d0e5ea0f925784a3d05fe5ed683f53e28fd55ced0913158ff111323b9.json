{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace (position 0, 0)\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at position (42, -83)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position 42, -83)\n- Wooden Chest (position 42.5, -81.5)\n- Burner Inserter (position 43.5, -81.5) that puts into the Wooden Chest\n- Burner Inserter (position 42.5, -80.5) that pulls from the Wooden Chest\n\n### Coal Supply System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest (position -14.5, -48.5)\n- Burner Mining Drill (position -15, -50)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n- **Errors related to coal supply:**\n  - Ensure that coal is available in the Wooden Chest before attempting to extract it. The current logs indicate that there is no coal available for extraction multiple times.\n  \n- **Errors with burner mining drill being out of fuel:**\n  - Regularly check the fuel status of burner mining drills. They are currently showing as \"NO_FUEL\" and need to be refueled to operate effectively.\n\n- **Errors with inserters waiting for items:**\n  - Ensure that the source items are available for inserters to function. The inserters are currently waiting for source items, indicating a lack of coal in the Wooden Chest.\n\n- **Errors with inserters waiting for space in destination:**\n  - Check the destination for available space before placing items into it. The burner inserters are waiting for space in the destination, which may indicate that the Wooden Chest is full.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - None defined yet.\n\n- **Variables:**\n  - `stone_furnace_inventory`: dict\n  - `wooden_chest_inventory`: dict\n  - `burner_mining_drill_status`: list\n  - `burner_inserter_status`: list\n  - `current_inventory`: dict"}
