{"content": "The error indicates that the `Prototype` dictionary does not have an entry for `'copper-plate'`. This suggests that `Prototype` might not include all item types, particularly those that are products rather than raw materials or entities.\n\nTo resolve this, we can directly use the string name of the item when calling `extract_item`. Here's how you can modify the code:\n\n```python\n# Extract items from the furnace to clear space.\nfor item, quantity in furnace_inventory.items():\n    extract_item(item, furnace.position, quantity=quantity)\n\n# Verify that the furnace inventory is now empty.\nfurnace_inventory_after = inspect_inventory(furnace)\nprint(f\"Furnace inventory after extraction: {furnace_inventory_after}\")\n\n# Now, attempt to insert coal and copper ore into the furnace again.\ninsert_item(Prototype.Coal, furnace, 5)\ninsert_item(Prototype.CopperOre, furnace, 10)\n```\n\nThis approach uses the item name directly from the inventory dictionary, which should match the expected input for `extract_item`. After clearing the inventory, you should be able to insert new items into the furnace. If there are further issues, ensure that the furnace is correctly positioned and accessible.", "summary_range": "[1-312]"}
