{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-13.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0)\n- Burner Inserter at position (-14.5, -46.5)\n\n### Coal Mining and Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (43.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -80.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (43.0, -82.0)\n- Burner Inserter at position (43.5, -80.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Full Chests\n- Ensure that chests are regularly emptied to prevent mining drills from halting operations. The chest at (-14.5, -48.5) and the chest at (41.5, -80.5) are full and need to be emptied to continue mining.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors due to Insufficient Inventory Items\n- Ensure that you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into a structure. The error occurred multiple times when trying to insert iron ore into furnaces without having enough in the inventory."}
