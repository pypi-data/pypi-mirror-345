{"content": "\"\"\"\nThe waiting period has concluded, and here are the updated statuses of our furnaces:\n\n### Updated Furnace Status:\n1. **First Furnace:**\n   - Fuel: 7 Coal\n   - Iron Ore: 0 (none remaining, finished processing)\n   - Iron Plates Produced: 81 (total)\n   - Status: NO INGREDIENTS (currently inactive)\n\n2. **Second Furnace:**\n   - Fuel: 9 Coal\n   - Iron Ore: 5 (available for processing)\n   - Iron Plates Produced: 54 (total)\n   - Status: WORKING (currently processing)\n\n### Summary:\n- The first furnace has successfully processed a total of 81 iron plates and is now idle with no iron ore left.\n- The second furnace is actively working with 5 iron ore, having produced a total of 54 iron plates so far.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. We need to gather more iron ore to ensure both furnaces can operate continuously.\n2. For now, the second furnace will continue to produce as long as it has iron ore available.\n\nLet\u2019s find the nearest iron ore patch and gather more resources to ensure production keeps going!\n\"\"\"\n\n# 1. Find the nearest iron ore position again\niron_ore_position = nearest(Resource.IronOre)\n\n# 2. Move to the iron ore position and harvest more iron ore\nmove_to(iron_ore_position)\nharvest_resource(iron_ore_position, quantity=10)\n\n# 3.
