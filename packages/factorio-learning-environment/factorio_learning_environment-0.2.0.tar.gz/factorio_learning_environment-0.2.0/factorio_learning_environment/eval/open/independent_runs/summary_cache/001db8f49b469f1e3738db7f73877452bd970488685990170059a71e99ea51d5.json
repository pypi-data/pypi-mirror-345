{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll generate a report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Transport System at (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0) facing DOWN\n- Wooden chest at (41.5, -80.5) containing 770 coal\n- Burner inserter at (42.5, -80.5) facing RIGHT\n- Transport belt at (43.5, -80.5) facing RIGHT\n\n### Smelting Setup at (46.0, -80.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace at (46.0, -80.0) facing UP\n- Burner inserter at (44.5, -80.5) facing RIGHT\n- Connected to transport belt from coal mining system\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement and Alignment Issues\n- When placing entities that need to interact (like inserters and furnaces), ensure proper alignment by:\n  - Using the exact drop position of inserters as reference\n  - Accounting for the 2x2 size of furnaces when calculating placement positions\n  - Cleaning the area of any items on ground before placement\n\n### Blocked Transport Systems\n- Clear transport belts of items before attempting to place new structures\n- Ensure proper spacing between entities to prevent blockages\n- Make sure there is a valid output destination for inserters to prevent \"waiting for space\" issues\n\n### Resource Management\n- Keep mining equipment fueled to prevent \"out of fuel\" warnings\n- Ensure proper input/output connections for all production entities\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nFunctions:\n- place_entity_next_to(): Places an entity adjacent to a reference entity with specified spacing and direction\n  - Success: When placement area is clear and within valid building space\n  - Failure: When collision with existing entities or invalid placement area (water)\n\nImportant Variables:\n- target_position: Position (x, y coordinates for entity placement)\n- inserter_drop_position: Position (coordinates where inserters will place items)\n- direction: Direction (entity orientation)"}
