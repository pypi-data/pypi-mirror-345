{"content": "# FACTORIO AGENT REPORT\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System at Position(-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position(-9.5, -0.5)\n- Boiler at position(-5.0, 2.5)\n- Steam engine at position(0.5, 6.5)\n- Connected with pipes between components\n- Fueled with coal\n\n### Iron Plate Production at Position(18.5, 73.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill at position(18.5, 73.5) mining iron ore\n- Stone furnace at position(19.0, 76.0) smelting iron ore into plates\n- Inserter at position(19.5, 78.5) to extract iron plates from furnace\n- Connected to power grid\n\n### Copper Plate Production at Position(-48.5, 82.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill at position(-48.5, 82.5) mining copper ore\n- Stone furnace at position(-48.0, 85.0) smelting copper ore into plates\n- Inserter at position(-47.5, 87.5) to extract copper plates from furnace\n- Wooden chest at position(-47.5, 89.5) for copper plate storage\n- Connected to power grid\n\n### Copper Cable Factory at Position(-42.5, 90.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine at position(-42.5, 90.5) set to produce copper cables\n- Inserter at position(-42.5, 88.5) to feed copper plates into assembler\n- Inserter at position(-44.5, 90.5) to extract copper cables\n- Connected to power grid\n\n### Electronic Circuit Factory at Position(-37.5, 102.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine at position(-37.5, 102.5) set to produce electronic circuits\n- Connected to power grid\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied spaces\n- Check if a position is already occupied before attempting to place an entity\n- When placing inserters near mining drills or furnaces, ensure the target position is clear\n- Use the entity's dimensions to calculate proper placement positions\n\n### Errors when connecting entities with transport belts\n- Transport belts cannot connect directly from a furnace as a source - use an inserter first\n- Transport belts cannot connect directly to a chest as a target - use an inserter first\n- When connecting with belts, ensure the pickup position of the target inserter is not blocked by other entities\n\n### Errors with inserter placement\n- Ensure inserters are placed with proper orientation relative to source and target entities\n- Check that both pickup and drop positions for inserters are clear before placement\n- Avoid placing inserters where their working area overlaps with other entities\n\n### Errors with assembling machine connections\n- When setting up assembling machines, ensure there's adequate space around them for inserters to operate\n- Position inserters correctly to feed materials into and extract products from assembling machines"}
