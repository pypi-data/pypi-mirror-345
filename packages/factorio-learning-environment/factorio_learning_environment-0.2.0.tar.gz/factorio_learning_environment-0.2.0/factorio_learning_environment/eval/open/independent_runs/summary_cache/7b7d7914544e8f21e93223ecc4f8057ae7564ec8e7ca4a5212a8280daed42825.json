{"content": "# FACTORY REPORT\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System at Position(-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump (position x=-9.5, y=-0.5) extracting water\n- Boiler (position x=-5.0, y=2.5) with coal fuel\n- Steam engine (position x=0.5, y=6.5) generating electricity\n- Pipe network connecting these components\n- Power poles creating an electricity network\n\n### Coal Mining Operation at Position(17.0, 10.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (position x=17.0, y=10.0) mining coal\n- Wooden chest (position x=16.5, y=8.5) collecting coal output\n\n### Iron Mining and Processing at Position(17.5, 72.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill (position x=17.5, y=72.5) mining iron ore\n- Wooden chest (position x=17.5, y=74.5) collecting iron ore\n- Inserter (position x=18.5, y=74.5) attempting to move iron ore from chest\n- Electric furnace (position x=29.5, y=76.5) for smelting iron ore\n- Second electric furnace (position x=22.5, y=76.5) not connected to power\n- Wooden chest (position x=32.5, y=76.5) for collecting iron plates\n- Inserter (position x=31.5, y=76.5) for moving iron plates to output chest\n\n### Copper Mining Operation at Position(-47.5, 77.5)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill (position x=-47.5, y=77.5) mining copper ore\n- Wooden chest (position x=-47.5, y=79.5) collecting copper ore\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied positions\n- Check if a position is already occupied before placing a new entity\n- Use different spacing parameters when placing entities next to each other\n- Example: `Could not place inserter next to x=17.5 y=74.5 with spacing 0 and direction Direction.RIGHT. A inserter already exists at the new position`\n\n### Errors when connecting entities with transport belts\n- Transport belts cannot connect directly from chests - use inserters as intermediaries\n- Ensure there is a clear path for belt placement without obstacles\n- Example: `Transport belts cannot be connected directly from a Prototype.WoodenChest object as a source`\n\n### Errors with entity placement blockage\n- Items on the ground can block entity placement\n- Check for nearby entities that might be causing collisions\n- Example: `Cannot place entity at the position {x = 19.5, y = 74.5 with the current direction... There might be a collision with existing entities`\n\n### Power connection issues\n- Some entities are not connected to the power network\n- Ensure all electrical components are within range of power poles\n- Example: `electric-furnace... warnings=['not connected to power network'], status=EntityStatus.NO_POWER`\n\n### Inserter output blockage\n- Ensure inserters have a valid destination for their output\n- Example: `warnings=['output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.']`"}
