Multiple recovery attempts were made to deploy a Lab at (0.5, 2.5) \u2013 intended to receive Automation Science Packs for research \u2013 but none succeeded due to missing Lab items in the inventory. Although pre\u2010existing furnaces were referenced for smelting (an iron\u2010smelting furnace at (5.0, 5.0) and a copper\u2010smelting furnace at (\u201327.0, \u201360.0)), no structures were actively constructed by the agent in these steps.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 API Call Misuse for Entity Retrieval\n  \u2013 Avoid passing unsupported keyword arguments (for example, remove \u201cradius\u201d if the API accepts only positional arguments).\n  \u2013 Ensure the argument list matches the function signature; verify the number and type of parameters to prevent TypeErrors.\n  \u2013 Check the return value of get_entities before using it (default to an empty list rather than iterating over a None value).\n\n\u2022 Lab Placement and Crafting Failures\n  \u2013 Verify that the required Lab item is available in the inventory prior to placement at (0.5, 2.5) to avoid placement errors.\n  \u2013 Before attempting to craft a Lab, confirm that all intermediary sub-ingredients (such as iron-gear-wheels, electronic circuits, and copper cables) are sufficiently available.\n  \u2013 Establish a robust resource production pipeline (including proper smelting cycles for iron and copper plates) so that all sub-components for Lab crafting are obtainable.\n  \u2013 Review fallback approaches when API calls do not return expected results; guard against performing operations on NoneType objects."}
