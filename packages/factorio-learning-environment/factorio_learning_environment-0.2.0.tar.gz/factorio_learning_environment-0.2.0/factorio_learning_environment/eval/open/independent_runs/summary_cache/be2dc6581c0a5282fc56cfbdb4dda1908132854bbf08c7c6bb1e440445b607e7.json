The agent repeatedly attempted to construct a Lab at position (0.5, 2.5) with the purpose of supplying Automation Science Packs for research\u2014but all placement and crafting efforts failed due to missing inventory elements and insufficient supply of required sub-ingredients.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 API Call Consistency:\n  - When invoking get_entities, use only the supported argument types. Avoid supplying unexpected keyword arguments (such as \u201cradius\u201d) or excess positional arguments to prevent signature mismatches.\n  - Ensure that functions returning entity lists yield a valid (even if empty) iterable rather than None before iterating over them.\n\n\u2022 Entity Placement and Inventory Verification:\n  - Confirm that the intended entity (for example, the Lab) is present in the inventory before attempting to place it.\n  \n\u2022 Crafting Requirements and Resource Chains:\n  - Verify that all sub-ingredients required for complex structures (such as the Lab) are available. Missing components (e.g. iron-gear-wheels, electronic circuits, copper cables) indicate an incomplete resource production chain.\n  - Establish proper resource conversion setups (via furnaces or crafting machines) to reliably supply the prerequisite items needed by higher-level recipes before initiating the lab crafting process."}
