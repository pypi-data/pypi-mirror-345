{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-13.5, 20.0)\nConsists of boiler (position -13.5, 20.0), steam engine (position -18.5, 19.5), and offshore pump (position -11.5, 26.5). The boiler is currently out of fuel, and the steam engine is not connected to the power network.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(-18.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position -18.0, -49.0) and a furnace (position -18.0, -49.0). The furnace has 5 coal as fuel and is producing iron plates.\n\n### Lab at position(-17.5, 23.5)\nConsists of a lab (position -17.5, 23.5) which is currently not powered and is set to research electronics.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when trying to insert items from inventory\n- Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. In the recent steps, the agent attempted to insert coal into the boiler but had none available.\n\n### Errors when harvesting resources\n- Make sure that the resource you are trying to harvest is within reach and available. The agent attempted to harvest coal but encountered an error indicating that there was nothing within reach to harvest.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it. This error was not explicitly mentioned in the recent steps, but it is a common issue that can arise during construction."}
