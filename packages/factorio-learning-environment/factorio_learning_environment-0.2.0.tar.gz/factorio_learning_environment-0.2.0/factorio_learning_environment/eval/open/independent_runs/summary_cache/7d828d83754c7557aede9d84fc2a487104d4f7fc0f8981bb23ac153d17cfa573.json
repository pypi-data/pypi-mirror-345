This structure supports the production of iron plates for crafting higher\u2010tier components.\n\n### Furnace for Copper Smelting at Position(-27.0, -60.0)\nConsists of a furnace located at (-27.0, -60.0) used to convert harvested copper ore into copper plates using available coal. The copper plates produced feed into further processing (e.g. copper cable production) necessary for lab crafting.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2013 API Invocation Errors with get_entities\n  - Avoid using unexpected keyword arguments (e.g. remove \u2018radius\u2019 if not supported) and ensure that only the expected parameters are passed. Confirm the correct calling signature to prevent TypeErrors related to positional versus keyword arguments.\n  \n\u2013 Handling None Returns\n  - Always verify that functions such as get_entities return a valid iterable (e.g. a list) before attempting to iterate over the results. Applying a fallback (empty list) can prevent errors when the result is None.\n  \n\u2013 Lab Crafting and Placement Issues\n  - Ensure the inventory contains the lab item before attempting placement. \n  - Confirm that all prerequisite resources and sub-ingredients (such as iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, copper-cables, and their base materials) are available and produced in sufficient quantities. \n  - Strengthen resource production processes (including proper smelting and crafting chains) to avoid missing ingredients during lab crafting attempts."}
