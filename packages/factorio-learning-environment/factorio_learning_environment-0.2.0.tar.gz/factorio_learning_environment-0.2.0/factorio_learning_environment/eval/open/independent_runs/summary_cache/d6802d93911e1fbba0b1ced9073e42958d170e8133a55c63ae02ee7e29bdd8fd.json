{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (22.5, -7.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (22.5, -7.5)\n- Boiler at Position (20.5, -4.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (19.5, -1.5)\n- Pipe Network connecting the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine\n- Small Electric Poles at various positions for power distribution\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (2.0, 0.0)\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-11.0, 20.0) with a Wooden Chest at Position (-11.5, 18.5) for iron ore collection\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (5.0, 5.0)\n- Inserter at Position (7.5, 5.5) and Wooden Chest at Position (8.5, 5.5) for copper plate collection\n\n### Copper Cable Factory\nConsists of:\n- Assembling Machine at Position (10.5, 0.5)\n- Inserter at Position (9.5, 5.5) for input into the assembling machine\n- Belt Group connecting the furnace at Position (5.0, 5.0) to the assembling machine at Position (10.5, 0.5)\n\n### Storage Area\nConsists of:\n- Wooden Chest at Position (-3.5, 0.5)\n- Inserter at Position (-3.5, 1.5) and Wooden Chest at Position (-3.5, 2.5) for item transfer\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- Pipe Group at Position (20.5, -10.5) for fluid transport\n- Pipe Group at Position (4.5, -9.5) for fluid transport\n- Pipe Group at Position (19.5, -2.5) for fluid transport\n\n### Belt System\n- Belt Group with inputs and outputs for material transport\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Accessing Belt Attributes\n- Ensure that the BeltGroup object has the correct attributes before attempting to access them. The 'direction' attribute does not exist for BeltGroup objects. Verify the object type and available attributes before use.\n\n### Errors with Unpowered Entities\n- Ensure that all electrical entities, such as inserters and assembling machines, are connected to a power source. Check the connections and power supply to avoid 'not receiving electricity' warnings.\n\n### Errors with Missing Ingredients\n- Ensure that all required ingredients are available for production processes. For example, the assembling machine requires copper plates to produce copper cables. Verify inventory and supply lines to prevent 'missing resources' warnings."}
