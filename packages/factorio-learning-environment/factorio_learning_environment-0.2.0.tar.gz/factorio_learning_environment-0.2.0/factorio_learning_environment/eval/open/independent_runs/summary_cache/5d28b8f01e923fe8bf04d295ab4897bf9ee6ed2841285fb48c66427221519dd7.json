{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0) with fuel inventory containing coal. It is currently working but has a warning indicating that the output is blocked by an item on the ground, and there is no sink entity to accept the output.\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0) with fuel inventory containing coal. It has a warning indicating no ingredients to smelt and currently holds iron plates in its result inventory.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied locations\n- Ensure that the desired location for placing entities like Wooden Chests, Burner Inserters, and Transport Belts is not already occupied by another entity. Check the tile before attempting to place.\n\n### Errors when moving entities to occupied locations\n- Verify that the target location for moving entities like Stone Furnaces is unoccupied before attempting to move.\n\n### Errors in connecting belts\n- Avoid trying to connect belts directly to a Stone Furnace. Use an inserter to input items into the Stone Furnace instead.\n\n### Errors when extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move closer to the target entity where you want to extract from before attempting to extract items.\n\n### Errors due to blocked outputs\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity, such as a chest or another processing unit, to accept the output from entities like Burner Mining Drills to avoid blockage warnings.\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities\n- Ensure that the entity you are trying to retrieve exists at the specified position before attempting to get it. Double-check the coordinates and entity type."}
