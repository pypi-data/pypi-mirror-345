Although the agent repeatedly attempted to place a Lab at (0.5, 2.5) for supplying Automation Science Packs, all placement and crafting attempts failed due to resource shortages and missing inventory items. Pre\u2010existing production units (such as the furnace at (5.0, 5.0) for iron plate smelting and the copper furnace at (\u201327.0, \u201360.0) for copper plate production) were referenced for processing but were not created by the agent.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 Errors with get_entities API usage\n\u2003\u2013 Incorrect argument usage was detected (using an unexpected keyword \u201cradius\u201d and supplying extra positional arguments). Verify the function\u2019s signature against the API documentation and use only supported parameters.\n\n\u2022 Lab placement failures\n\u2003\u2013 Attempts to place a Lab at (0.5, 2.5) failed because no lab item was available in the inventory. Ensure that the Lab or its constituent parts are present prior to placement.\n\n\u2022 Lab crafting errors due to insufficient sub-ingredients\n\u2003\u2013 Multiple crafting attempts failed because required sub-components (such as iron\u2011gear\u2011wheel, electronic\u2011circuit, and copper\u2011cable) were missing or could not be produced. Confirm that all intermediate products are available (through proper smelting or prior crafting) and that their production chains are complete before initiating Lab crafting.\n\n\u2022 Iteration on NoneType results\n\u2003\u2013 A \u201cNoneType\u201d object was erroneously iterated over when processing the output of get_entities. Always check that API calls return a valid list (or an empty one) before performing iterations.\n"}
