{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-14.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-12.0, -51.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-11.5, -49.5) for temporary storage of iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-11.5, -48.5) for transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n\n### Coal Mining and Distribution System at Position (52.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (52.0, -82.0) extracting coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (53.5, -80.5) for storing mined coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (52.5, -79.5) transferring coal from the chest to another chest at position (52.5, -78.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -78.5) for additional coal storage.\n- Burner Inserter at position (52.5, -76.5) for further coal distribution.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Related to Full Inventory or Storage\n- Ensure that chests used for storing mined resources are emptied regularly to prevent mining operations from halting due to full storage. For example, the chest at (-11.5, -49.5) needs to be emptied to continue mining iron ore.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Verify that the source items are available for inserters to function correctly. The inserter at position (-13.5, -46.5) is waiting for source items, indicating a potential supply chain issue.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the current inventory items and their quantities. Current inventory includes 'wooden-chest': 3, 'wood': 10, 'iron-ore': 503, 'iron-plate': 769."}
