{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0) with coal as fuel, currently working with a warning of \"output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\" The drill is extracting iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0) with coal as fuel, currently working and converting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied locations\n- Ensure that the target location for placing entities such as Burner Inserters, Stone Furnaces, Wooden Chests, and Transport Belts is free from other entities or obstacles before attempting to place them.\n\n### Errors when extracting or interacting with non-existent entities\n- Verify the existence of the entity at the specified position before attempting to interact with it. This will prevent errors such as attempting to get a stone furnace at a position where it does not exist.\n\n### Errors due to blocked outputs\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity or clear path for the output of entities like the Burner Mining Drill to prevent blockage warnings and ensure continuous operation."}
