{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (5.0, -73.0)\nConsists of the following entity:\n- Stone Furnace at position (5.0, -73.0) with coal as fuel. It is currently not working due to no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -73.0)\nConsists of the following entity:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -73.0) with coal as fuel. It is currently not working due to no ingredients to smelt. The furnace has produced 14 copper plates.\n\n### Lab at position (1.5, -68.5)\nConsists of the following entity:\n- Lab at position (1.5, -68.5) connected to a power source but still lacks power. It is set up for research in automation.\n\n### Electricity Generator at position (-45.5, -124.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore pump at position (-45.5, -124.5) connected to the boiler.\n- Boiler at position (-43.5, -123.0) with coal as fuel and connected to the offshore pump. It is now operational and producing steam.\n- Pipe group connecting the offshore pump and the boiler, consisting of pipes at positions (-45.5, -123.5) and (-45.5, -122.5).\n\n### Electricity Group\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Small electric poles at positions (1.5, -70.5), (4.5, -71.5), (6.5, -69.5), (5.5, -72.5), and (3.5, -68.5) with no voltage. This setup is intended to provide power but currently lacks connectivity to the lab.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities without having them in inventory\n- Ensure that you have the required entity in your inventory before attempting to place it. For example, attempting to place a stone furnace at position (4.5, -73.5) failed because there was no stone furnace in the inventory.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient crafting materials\n- Verify that you have all necessary materials before crafting an item. For instance, crafting a stone furnace requires 5 stones, but the inventory had 0 stones, leading to an AssertionError. Always check material requirements against your current inventory.\n\n### Errors due to incorrect fuel insertion\n- Ensure that the correct amount of fuel is inserted into entities. An AssertionError occurred because the expected amount of coal to be inserted was 10, but the insertion did not meet the expected condition. Double-check the fuel requirements and insertion logic to avoid such errors. In step 6, an error was noted due to 0 coal being in the furnace when 10 was expected. Ensure accurate fuel management to prevent such discrepancies.\n- In step 16, an error occurred when attempting to insert coal into a furnace due to a lack of coal in the inventory. Always verify that you have the necessary fuel before attempting to insert it into a furnace.\n\n### Errors when retrieving non-existent entities\n- Ensure that the entity exists at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it. An error occurred when trying to get a stone furnace at position (5.0, -71.0), but no such entity was found. Verify the position and existence of entities to avoid such errors.\n- Another error occurred when attempting to retrieve a lab at position (7.0, -70.0). Ensure that the lab is placed at the specified position before trying to access it.\n- In step 55, an error occurred when attempting to retrieve a steam engine at position (-41.5, -122.5). Make sure the steam engine is correctly placed and verify its position before accessing it.\n\n### Errors due to smelting timeout\n- Check the fuel and input materials for smelting processes to avoid timeouts. An exception occurred due to a copper plate smelting timeout, indicating potential issues with fuel levels or input materials. Regularly monitor and adjust fuel and input levels to ensure continuous operation.\n\n### Errors due to missing crafting machines\n- Some items require specific crafting machines or furnaces. For example, iron plates cannot be crafted manually; they require smelting in a furnace. Ensure you have the necessary machines or setups for crafting complex items like automation science packs.\n\n### Errors due to missing lab in inventory\n- Ensure that you have a lab in your inventory before attempting to use or place it. An error occurred because there was no lab available in the inventory. Craft or acquire a lab to proceed with research-related activities.\n\n### Errors due to missing ingredients for crafting\n- Check that all required ingredients are available before attempting to craft complex items. For instance, crafting a lab requires iron-gear-wheels, electronic circuits, and transport belts. Ensure these components are in your inventory to avoid crafting errors.\n\n### Errors due to missing iron plates for crafting\n- Iron plates are a crucial component for"}
