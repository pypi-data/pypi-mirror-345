Check the prototype definitions before attempting to place.\n- Make sure to remove any existing electric poles if they block the placement of new ones.\n\n### Errors when placing wooden chests\n- Ensure that the first argument for placing a wooden chest is a valid Prototype object. Verify the prototype definitions before placing.\n\n### Errors related to lab power\n- The lab requires a power source to function. Ensure that electric poles are correctly placed and connected to provide power to the lab.\n\n### Errors when inserting items\n- When inserting items, ensure that the second argument is a valid Entity or EntityGroup, not a Position. Use the correct entity reference for insertion."}
