{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Fluid System with Offshore Pump at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-47.5, -123.5), connected to a fluid system.\n- Pipe at position (-47.5, -122.5) connected to the offshore pump.\n- Pipe at position (-48.5, -121.5) as part of the fluid system, although currently empty.\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -73.0) with coal fuel, but currently inactive due to no ingredients.\n- Stone Furnace at position (9.0, -64.0) with coal fuel, but currently inactive due to no ingredients.\n- Stone Furnace at position (6.0, -62.0) with coal fuel, but currently inactive due to no ingredients.\n\n### Inserter and Storage System\nConsists of:\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5), currently not receiving electricity.\n- Wooden Chest at position (7.5, -61.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (6.5, -59.5) containing iron plates.\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of:\n- Multiple small electric poles, including positions such as (5.5, -60.5), (7.5, -60.5), and (5.5, -59.5), currently not supplying power to the inserter.\n\n### Lab\n- Lab with automation science packs, currently not receiving power.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Retrieving Non-Existent Entities\n- Ensure that the entity exists at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it. For example, attempting to get a boiler at position (-46.5, -122.0) failed because no such entity was present.\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities on Occupied Tiles\n- Verify that the target tile is clear of other objects before placing an entity. Attempting to place a boiler at (-48.5, -121.5) failed due to an existing obstruction."}
