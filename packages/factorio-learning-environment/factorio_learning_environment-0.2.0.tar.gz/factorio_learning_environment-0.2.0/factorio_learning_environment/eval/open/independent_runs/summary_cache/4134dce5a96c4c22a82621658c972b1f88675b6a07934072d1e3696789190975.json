The agent repeatedly attempted to place an offshore pump at various positions without success. Verify that the chosen location is adjacent to a water source and is not obstructed by other entities.\n\n### Errors when placing boiler\n- Ensure that the position for placing the boiler is suitable. The agent attempted to place a boiler at multiple locations, all of which were unsuitable. Verify that the chosen location is clear and has the necessary space for placement.\n\n### Validation errors for BuildingBox\n- When placing entities like offshore pumps and boilers, ensure that the dimensions (height and width) are valid integers. The agent encountered validation errors indicating that the dimensions were not correctly specified as integers.\n\n### Type errors when placing entities\n- When using functions or methods that require integer inputs, ensure that the arguments provided are of the correct type. The agent encountered errors because the input was not a valid integer, which suggests an incorrect use of data types in the code."}
