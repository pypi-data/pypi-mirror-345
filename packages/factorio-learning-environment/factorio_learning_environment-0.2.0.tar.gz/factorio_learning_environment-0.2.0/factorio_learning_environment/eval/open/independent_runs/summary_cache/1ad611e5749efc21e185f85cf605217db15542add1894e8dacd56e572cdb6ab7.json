{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Automation Science Pack Production Setup (around x=8.5, y=13.5)\nConsists of following entities:\n- Assembling machine-1 at position (x=8.5, y=13.5)\n- Output wooden chest at position (x=11.5, y=13.5)\n- Output inserter at position (x=10.5, y=13.5)\n- Iron gear input chest at position (x=9.5, y=10.5)\n- Copper plate input chest at position (x=9.5, y=11.5)\n- Transport belt system from (x=8.5, y=11.5) to (x=1.5, y=14.5)\n\n### Power Generation System (around x=-4.5, y=12.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam engine at position (x=-4.5, y=12.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=-4.5, y=16.0)\n- Offshore pump at position (x=-3.5, y=27.5)\n- Multiple pipe groups connecting these components\n- Electric pole network with poles at various positions including (x=8.5, y=15.5)\n\n### Mining and Smelting Operations\nMultiple setups consisting of:\n1. Setup at (-28.0, -61.0):\n   - Burner mining drill\n   - Wooden chest at (-27.5, -59.5)\n   - Stone furnace at (-25.0, -59.0)\n   - Output chest at (-22.5, -58.5)\n   - Inserters connecting these components\n\n2. Setup at (-18.0, -53.0):\n   - Burner mining drill\n   - Wooden chest at (-17.5, -51.5)\n   - Stone furnace at (-15.0, -51.0)\n   - Output chest at (-12.5, -50.5)\n   - Inserters connecting these components\n\n3. Additional setup at (41.0, -82.0):\n   - Burner mining drill\n   - Wooden chest at (41.5, -80.5)\n   - Inserter at (41.5, -79.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Conflicts\n- Check for existing entities before placing new ones at a position\n- When placing entities next to each other, ensure proper spacing and direction\n- Consider using different directions or increased spacing when initial placement fails\n\n### Power System Issues\n- Ensure proper connection of water pipes between components\n- Make sure boilers have fuel to operate\n- Verify electrical connections between power producers and consumers\n\n### Machine Operation Issues\n- Keep machines fueled - multiple burner mining drills are out of fuel\n- Ensure proper input/output connections for assembling machines\n- Verify correct placement and orientation of inserters for material flow\n\n### Resource Flow Problems\n- Check that inserters are properly oriented to pick up and drop items\n- Ensure chests are placed in accessible positions for inserters\n- Verify transport belt connections don't block essential entity placements\n\n### Connection Issues\n- When connecting entities with pipes, ensure connection points are not blocked\n- Plan pipe layouts to avoid conflicts with other structures\n- Consider rearranging entities if connection points are blocked"}
