{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=1.5, y=23.0)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\n- Boiler at Position (x=1.5, y=23.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\n- Pipe connections between boiler, steam engine, and offshore pump\n- PipeGroup for fluid transportation from offshore pump to boiler\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting pipes\n- Ensure that the entities you are trying to connect with pipes are within a valid range and that there are no obstructions. The connection attempt between the boiler at (x=1.5, y=23.0) and the steam engine at (x=17.5, y=20.5) failed due to incorrect pipe connections.\n\n### Errors due to lack of fuel\n- Regularly check and refuel entities like boilers to prevent them from running out of fuel, which can halt production processes.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Defined Functions\n- `connect_entities(boiler, steam_engine, {Prototype.Pipe, Prototype.UndergroundPipe})`: This function attempts to connect a boiler to a steam engine using specified pipe types. It failed due to incorrect connection points or entity positions.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `pipes`: List of pipe entities used for connection attempts.\n- `boiler`: Boiler entity at position (x=1.5, y=23.0).\n- `steam_engine`: Steam engine entity at position (x=17.5, y=20.5).\n- `offshore_pump`: Offshore pump entity at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)."}
