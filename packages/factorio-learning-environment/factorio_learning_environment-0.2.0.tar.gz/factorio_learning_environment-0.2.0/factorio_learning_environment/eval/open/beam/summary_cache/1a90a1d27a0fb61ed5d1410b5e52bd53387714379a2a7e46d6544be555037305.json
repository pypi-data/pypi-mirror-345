We need to gather more iron ore to keep the second furnace operational.\n2. Monitor the first furnace as it continues to process its remaining iron ore.\n\nLet\u2019s find the nearest iron ore patch and gather more resources to ensure both furnaces can operate continuously.\n\"\"\"\n\n# 1. Find the nearest iron ore position again\niron_ore_position = nearest(Resource.IronOre)\n\n# 2.
