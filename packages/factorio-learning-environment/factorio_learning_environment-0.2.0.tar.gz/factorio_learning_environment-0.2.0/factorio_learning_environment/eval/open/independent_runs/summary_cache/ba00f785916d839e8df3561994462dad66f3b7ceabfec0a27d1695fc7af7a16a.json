{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-11.5, 18.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position -11.5, 18.5), boiler (position -11.5, 25.0), and offshore pump (position -9.5, 24.5). This structure is responsible for generating electricity using water from the offshore pump, which feeds into the boiler, producing steam to power the steam engine.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(5, 5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 5, 5) and a furnace (position 5, 5). This structure is used to mine copper ore and smelt it into copper plates.\n\n### Iron plate factory at position(0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace (position 0, 0) that smelts iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when crafting items due to missing ingredients\n- Ensure that all required sub-ingredients for crafting are available in the inventory or are being produced by the necessary machines. For example, iron plates are required to craft pipes, so ensure they are being smelted in a furnace before attempting to craft.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into furnaces\n- Ensure that you are passing the correct entity type when inserting items. The second argument must be an Entity or EntityGroup, not a Position. Verify that the furnace entity is correctly referenced when inserting iron ore.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
