{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) which extracts iron ore and drops it into a chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5) which stores the extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5) which is aligned to transfer iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0) which is intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities too far away\n- Ensure you are within the maximum placement distance of 10 units when placing entities like stone furnaces and wooden chests. Move closer to the target position before attempting to place the entity.\n\n### Errors with inserter setup\n- Verify that the inserter is correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items from the source (chest) to the destination (furnace). Reposition the inserter if necessary to ensure proper item transfer.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient resources\n- Ensure you have enough coal in your inventory to refuel entities like mining drills and inserters. Regularly check and replenish coal supplies to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Errors with full or empty inventories\n- Regularly check the chest inventory to ensure it is not full, which can halt mining operations. Extract items from the chest to free up space.\n- Ensure that the furnace is receiving the necessary ingredients (iron ore) to operate. Check the inserter and chest setup if the furnace is not receiving materials.\n\n### Warnings from entities\n- Address warnings from entities such as the burner mining drill indicating that the chest at the drop position is full. Empty the chest to continue mining operations.\n- Address warnings from the furnace indicating \"no ingredients to smelt\" by ensuring a consistent supply of iron ore."}
