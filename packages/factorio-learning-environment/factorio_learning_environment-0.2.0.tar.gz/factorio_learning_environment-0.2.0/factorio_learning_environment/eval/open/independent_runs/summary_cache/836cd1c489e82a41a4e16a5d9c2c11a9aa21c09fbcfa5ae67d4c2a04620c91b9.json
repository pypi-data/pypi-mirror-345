{"content": "Here's the updated report incorporating steps 120-127:\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Mining Operation at (16.0, 72.0) and (16.5, 74.5)\n- Current components:\n  - Burner mining drill at (16.0, 72.0) (working with coal)\n  - Electric mining drill at (16.5, 74.5) (now operational)\n  - Wooden chest at (17.5, 71.5) (burner output)\n  - Wooden chest at (16.5, 76.5) (electric output)\n- Operational status:\n  - Combined production of 78 iron ore/minute\n  - Electric drill now receiving 1600.0 power\n\n### Power Plant at (-9.5, -0.5)\n- Current components:\n  - Offshore pump at (-9.5, -0.5)\n  - Boiler at (-7.0, 0.5) (20 coal fuel)\n  - Steam engine at (-2.5, 0.5)\n  - Power pole network connecting to mining operation\n- Operational status:\n  - Generating 15000 energy\n  - Now properly connected to mining operation\n  - Steam production active (41 steam)\n\n### Power Distribution Network\n- Key poles:\n  - (-2.5, 3.5)\n  - (5.5, 3.5)\n  - (13.5, 3.5)\n  - (13.5, 73.5)\n- Fully connected system delivering power to electric drill\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Power Network Issues (Critical)\n- Multiple pole placement conflicts (steps 122,124,125)\n- Disconnected power network (step 123)\n- Solutions:\n  1. Implement complete power pole removal before replacement\n  2. Verify network connectivity after placement\n  3. Check pole spacing requirements (max 7.5 tiles)\n\n### Entity Placement Conflicts (Recurring)\n- Chest placement failure (step 120)\n- Pole placement failures (steps 122,124)\n- Required fixes:\n  1. Always scan target position before placement\n  2. Implement removal of existing entities first\n  3. Add collision detection system\n\n### Power System Optimization\n- Initial electric drill power issues (steps 121-123)\n- Solutions:\n  1. Verify power flow through entire network\n  2. Check steam engine output capacity\n  3. Monitor power satisfaction levels\n\n### Production Monitoring\n- Inconsistent throughput measurements\n- Recommended:\n  1. Implement continuous production monitoring\n  2. Set up automated alerts for production drops\n  3. Track resource consumption rates\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Defined Functions\n1. `build_power_connection(start: Position, end: Position) -> bool`\n   - Successfully connected power (step 126)\n   - Needs better error handling\n\n2. `verify_power_delivery(entity: Entity) -> float`\n   - Working but needs network tracing\n\n3. `optimize_mining_output() -> Dict[Resource, int]`\n   - Successful optimization (step 127)\n   - Needs expansion for multiple resources\n\n### Important Variables\n- `power_network: List[Position]` (tracking pole positions)\n- `mining_output: Dict[str, int]` (production tracking)\n- `power_capacity: float` (current 15000.0)"}
