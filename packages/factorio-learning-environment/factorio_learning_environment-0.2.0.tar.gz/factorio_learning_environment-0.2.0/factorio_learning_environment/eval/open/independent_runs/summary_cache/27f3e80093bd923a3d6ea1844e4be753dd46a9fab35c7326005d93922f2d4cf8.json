{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at Position (x=17.5, y=20.5) with an energy output of 15000.0. It is currently not connected due to no input liquid and no fluid present in connections.\n- Boiler at Position (x=1.5, y=23.0) with no fuel and connected to the steam engine via a series of pipes. The boiler's steam output point is at Position (x=1.5, y=21.5).\n- Offshore Pump at Position (x=-9.5, y=24.5) which is working and supplying water to the system.\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- PipeGroup (fluid_system=7075) at Position (x=3.5, y=17.5) is currently empty.\n- PipeGroup (fluid_system=7086) at Position (x=-9.5, y=23.5) is full and outputs water.\n\n### Electricity Network\n- ElectricityGroup (id=13245) with poles distributed across various positions, providing a voltage of 0.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure that the pipe connections are correctly aligned and that there is a valid path between the entities you are trying to connect. The error \"Failed to connect {'Pipe'} from pipe at x=1.5 y=21.5 to steam-engine at x=17.5 y=20.5\" indicates a misalignment or obstruction in the intended path.\n\n### Boiler Out of Fuel\n- Regularly check the fuel levels in boilers to ensure they are operational. The boiler at Position (x=1.5, y=23.0) is currently out of fuel, which prevents it from generating steam.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - `connect_entities`: Attempts to connect two entities with a specified prototype (e.g., Pipe). Failure occurs if there is no valid path or alignment between the entities.\n  \n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `pipes`: List of pipes intended to connect steam output to the steam engine.\n  - `steam_output_position`: Position of the steam output from the boiler.\n  - `steam_engine_position`: Position of the steam engine."}
