{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing Facility at Position (41, -82)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0)\n- Iron Chest at position (41.5, -80.5) for coal storage\n- Stone Furnace at position (43.0, -82.0) for smelting\n- Burner Inserters at positions (40.5, -80.5), (42.5, -80.5), and (43.5, -80.5) for transferring coal and iron plates\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-15, -50)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) for iron ore storage\n- Stone Furnaces at positions (-13.0, -48.0), (-11.0, -48.0), and (-9.0, -48.0) for smelting\n- Burner Inserters at positions (-15.5, -48.5), (-14.5, -46.5), and (-14.5, -45.5) for transferring iron ore and plates\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Extracting Items\n- Ensure that the target entity (e.g., chest or mining drill) has sufficient items before attempting to extract. Adjust the quantity to match available resources.\n\n### Errors when Transferring Items to Furnaces\n- Verify that your inventory contains the necessary items (e.g., iron ore) before attempting to transfer them to another entity like a furnace.\n\n### Undefined Storage Variables\n- Define all storage variables (e.g., `new_iron_ore_storage`, `additional_coal_storage`) before using them in operations to avoid undefined variable errors.\n\n### Inventory Space Issues\n- Ensure there is enough space in your inventory before extracting items to prevent extraction failures due to lack of space.\n\n### Misplaced or Full Chests\n- Regularly check and empty chests at drop positions to prevent mining drills from stopping due to full storage."}
