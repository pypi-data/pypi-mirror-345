{"content": "Ah, now I understand the core issue! We can't craft iron gear wheels directly because they require iron plates, and iron plates must be smelted in a furnace first. Let's fix our approach:\n\n1. First, we need to get a furnace working to create iron plates from iron ore\n2. Then we can craft iron gear wheels\n3. Finally craft the burner inserter\n\nLet's focus on getting one furnace operational first:\n\n```python\n# Check our inventory and the chest contents\ninventory = inspect_inventory()\nprint(f\"Current inventory: {inventory}\")\n\n# Get our source chest with iron ore\nchest = get_entity(Prototype.IronChest, Position(x=-15.5, y=21.5))\nprint(f\"Source chest contains: {chest.inventory}\")\n\n# Place furnace if not already placed\nmove_to(Position(x=-11.5, y=24.5))\nfurnace = place_entity(\n    Prototype.StoneFurnace,\n    position=Position(x=-11.5, y=24.5)\n)\n\nif furnace:\n    print(f\"Placed furnace at {furnace.position}\")\n    \n    # Add fuel to furnace\n    move_to(furnace.position)\n    insert_item(Prototype.Coal, furnace, quantity=5)\n    print(\"Added fuel to furnace\")\n    \n    # Get some iron ore from the chest and put it in the furnace\n    # This will start producing iron plates\n    move_to(chest.position)\n    take_item(Prototype.IronOre, chest, quantity=10)\n    move_to(furnace.position)\n    insert_item(Prototype.IronOre, furnace, quantity=10)\n    print(\"Added iron ore to furnace\")\n\n# Wait for some iron plates to be produced\nprint(\"Waiting for iron plates to be produced...\")\nsleep(5)\n\n# Check our inventory for iron plates\ninventory = inspect_inventory()\nprint(f\"Updated inventory: {inventory}\")\n```\n\nThis should get us started with producing iron plates. Once we have iron plates, we can craft iron gear wheels and then burner inserters to automate the process.", "summary_range": "[1-1408]"}
