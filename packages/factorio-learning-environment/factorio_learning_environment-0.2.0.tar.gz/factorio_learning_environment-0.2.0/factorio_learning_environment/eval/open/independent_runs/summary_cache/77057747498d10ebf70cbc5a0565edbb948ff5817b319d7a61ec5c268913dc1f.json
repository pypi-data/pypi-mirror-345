{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nNo structures have been successfully created on the map. All attempts to place entities have failed, resulting in an empty map.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when moving to positions\n- Ensure that the 'Position' object is used correctly. It should not be called as a function. Verify the syntax and usage when moving to a specific area.\n\n### Errors when using string indices\n- When accessing elements by index, ensure that indices are integers. Avoid using strings as indices in operations that require integer indices.\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Before attempting to place an entity, ensure that the target tile is unoccupied and suitable for the entity. This includes checking for existing entities or obstacles that may prevent placement.\n\n### Pathfinding errors\n- Verify that the pathfinding system is correctly configured and that the goal position is valid. Ensure that the path request is feasible and that the goal position is reachable from the current position."}
