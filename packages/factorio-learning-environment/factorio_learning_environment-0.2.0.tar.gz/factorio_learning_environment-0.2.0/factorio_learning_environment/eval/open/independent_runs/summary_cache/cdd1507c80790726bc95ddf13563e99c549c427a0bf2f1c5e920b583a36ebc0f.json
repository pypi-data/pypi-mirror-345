{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-0.5, -9.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position -0.5, -9.5) and boiler (position -4.5, 24.0). The steam engine is not connected to a power network and has no input liquid.\n\n### Offshore pump at position(-10.5, 25.5)\nConsists of an offshore pump (position -10.5, 25.5) that is currently working and connected to a pipe (position -10.5, 24.5) for fluid extraction.\n\n### Stone furnace at position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of a stone furnace (position 0.0, 0.0) that is currently not smelting due to no ingredients being available.\n\n### Stone furnace at position(5.0, 5.0)\nConsists of a stone furnace (position 5.0, 5.0) that is currently not smelting due to no ingredients being available.\n\n### Labs at positions(5.5, -12.5) and (2.5, 1.5)\nConsists of two labs (positions 5.5, -12.5 and 2.5, 1.5) that are currently not powered.\n\n### Pipe groups\nConsists of multiple pipe groups at the following positions:\n- PipeGroup at position (-8.5, -6.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (-7.5, -7.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (-10.5, -4.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (-9.5, -5.5)\n\n### Electricity group\nConsists of an electricity group (id=133373) with multiple small electric poles at various positions, including (0.5, -12.5) and (-16.5, 18.5).\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting boiler to steam engine\n- Ensure that there are no obstructions in the path when attempting to connect pipes between the boiler and steam engine. Check for any entities that may block the connection.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### AttributeError with PipeGroup\n- Verify that the correct attributes are being accessed when interacting with pipe groups. Ensure that the entity being referenced has the expected properties."}
