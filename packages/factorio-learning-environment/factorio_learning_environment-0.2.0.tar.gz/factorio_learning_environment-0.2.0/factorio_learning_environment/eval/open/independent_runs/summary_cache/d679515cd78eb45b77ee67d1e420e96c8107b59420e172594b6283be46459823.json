{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Iron Plate Smelting Setup at position (52.0, -79.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (52.0, -79.0)\n- **Inserter** at position (53.5, -79.5) configured to transfer items from the furnace to a chest\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (53.5, -78.5) for storing iron plates\n\n#### Coal Mining Setup at position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (41.0, -82.0) mining coal\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (41.5, -80.5) for storing coal (currently full)\n- **Inserter** at position (42.5, -80.5) transferring coal from the mining drill to the chest\n\n#### Additional Chests and Inserters\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (56.5, -78.5) with an **Inserter** at position (55.5, -78.5) configured to transfer items into it.\n\n---\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n1. **Furnace Not Transferring Iron Plates to Chest**  \n   - Ensure the inserter is correctly configured to transfer items from the furnace to the chest.  \n   - Verify that the furnace has sufficient fuel and input materials to produce iron plates.  \n\n2. **Furnace Not Working Due to Lack of Ingredients**  \n   - Ensure the furnace has both fuel (coal) and input materials (iron ore) before expecting it to produce iron plates.  \n\n3. **Placing Entities Too Far Away**  \n   - Move closer to the target position before attempting to place entities. The maximum placement distance is 10 tiles.  \n\n4. **Attempting to Access Non-Existent Entities**  \n   - Verify that the entity exists at the specified position before attempting to interact with it.  \n\n5. **Chest Full, Preventing Mining**  \n   - Empty the chest at position (41.5, -80.5) to allow the mining drill to continue producing coal.  \n\n---\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n#### Utility Functions\n- **`place_entity(Prototype, position)`**  \n  - **Failure Mode**: Throws an exception if the target position is too far away or if the entity cannot be placed.  \n  - **Success Mode**: Places the entity at the specified position.  \n\n- **`get_entity(Prototype, position)`**  \n  - **Failure Mode**: Throws an exception if no entity of the specified type exists at the position.  \n  - **Success Mode**: Returns the entity at the specified position.  \n\n#### Important Variables\n- **`output_chest`**: `WoodenChest` at position (53.5, -78.5)  \n- **`furnace`**: `StoneFurnace` at position (52.0, -79.0)  \n- **`inventory`**: Dictionary containing item counts in the agent's inventory."}
