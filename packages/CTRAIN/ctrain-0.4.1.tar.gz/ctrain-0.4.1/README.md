# CTRAIN

CTRAIN is a unified, modular and comprehensive package for certifiably training neural networks and evaluating their robustness.

## Overview

CTRAIN integrates multiple state-of-the-art certified training approaches, which are:

- Interval Bound Propagation (IBP) ([Gowal et al., 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.12715) with the Improvements of [Shi et al., 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.06700))
- CROWN-IBP ([Zhang et al., 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.06316))
- SABR ([Müller et al., 2023](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.04871))
- TAPS ([Mao et al., 2023](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2023/file/e8b0c97b34fdaf58b2f48f8cca85e76a-Paper-Conference.pdf))
- STAPS (combination of SABR and TAPS, [Mao et al., 2023](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2023/file/e8b0c97b34fdaf58b2f48f8cca85e76a-Paper-Conference.pdf))
- MTL-IBP ([De Palma et al., 2023](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.13991))

Furthermore, CTRAIN enables easy evaluation of the adversarial and certified robustness of a given neural network, using the following methods:

- Adversarial Robustness
  - PGD ([Madry et al., 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.06083))

- Certified Robustness (Incomplete Verification)
  - IBP ([Gowal et al., 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.12715))
  - CROWN-IBP ([Zhang et al., 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.06316))
  - CROWN ([Zhang et al., 2018](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.00866))

- Certified Robustness (Complete Verification)
  - α,β-CROWN ([Xu et al., 2020](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.13824), [Wang et al., 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.06624))

## Key Features
CTRAIN has the goal of providing an unified, comprehensive, accessible and flexible framework for certified training. Key features include:
- Standardised, modular and highly-configurable implementations of popular and performant certified training methods based on the `auto_LiRPA` library ([Xu et al., 2020](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020/file/0cbc5671ae26f67871cb914d81ef8fc1-Paper.pdf))
- Unified and accessible interface through model wrappers
- Based on PyTorch for easy integration into common machine learning pipelines
- Seamless integration of sophisticated hyperparameter optimisation using SMAC3 ([Lindauer et al., 2022](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume23/21-0888/21-0888.pdf))
- Comprehensive evaluation tools for adversarial and certified robustness
  - Support for both incomplete and complete verification methods, including the state-of-the-art complete verification system α,β-CROWN
- Detailed documentation with API reference, setup guide, and usage examples
- Open-source with a permissive MIT license
- Active development and maintenance by the Chair for Artificial Intelligence Methodology at RWTH Aachen University

## Installation and Quick Start
First, install CTRAIN using `pip`:
```sh
pip install CTRAIN
```
Or, to setup the package for development purposes, run:
```sh
git submodule init
git submodule update
pip install --no-deps git+https://github.com/KaidiXu/onnx2pytorch@8447c42c3192dad383e5598edc74dddac5706ee2
pip install --no-deps git+https://github.com/Verified-Intelligence/auto_LiRPA.git@cf0169ce6bfb4fddd82cfff5c259c162a23ad03c
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```
Then, you can train and evaluate the standard CNN7 architecture proposed by Shi et al. on the CIFAR-10 dataset using the IBP certified training technique in 12 lines of code:
```python
from CTRAIN.model_definitions import CNN7_Shi
from CTRAIN.data_loaders import load_cifar10
from CTRAIN.model_wrappers import ShiIBPModelWrapper

train_loader, test_loader = load_cifar10(val_split=False)
in_shape = [3, 32, 32]

model = CNN7_Shi(in_shape=in_shape)
wrapped_model = ShiIBPModelWrapper(model=model, input_shape=in_shape, eps=2/255, num_epochs=160)

wrapped_model.train_model(train_loader)
std_acc, cert_acc, adv_acc = wrapped_model.evaluate(test_loader)
```
