Multiple attempts were made to locate, craft, and position a Lab at (0.5, 2.5) for research support, but none succeeded due to resource and crafting shortfalls. Although furnace entities (e.g. at Position(x=5.0, y=5.0) and Position(x=-27.0, y=-60.0)) were referenced during smelting operations, no new production structures were constructed.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 API Misuse with get_entities  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u2013 Call get_entities using its correct signature. Avoid including unsupported keywords (such as \u201cradius\u201d) or extra positional arguments.\n\n\u2022 Lab Placement and Null Entity Handling  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u2013 Verify that a Lab is available in the inventory before attempting placement, and ensure that any returned list of lab entities is validated (i.e. not None) before iterating over it.\n\n\u2022 Lab Crafting Resource Shortage  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u2013 Confirm that all required sub-ingredients (for example, iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, and copper-cables) are producible and available. Ensure the production chain (including smelting and intermediate crafting) is sufficient to meet the lab\u2019s recipe requirements.\n\n\u2022 Resource Chain Management  \n\u00a0\u00a0\u2013 Monitor resource counts and adjust smelting or pre-production inputs accordingly, so that all prerequisite components for Lab crafting are reliably obtainable."}
