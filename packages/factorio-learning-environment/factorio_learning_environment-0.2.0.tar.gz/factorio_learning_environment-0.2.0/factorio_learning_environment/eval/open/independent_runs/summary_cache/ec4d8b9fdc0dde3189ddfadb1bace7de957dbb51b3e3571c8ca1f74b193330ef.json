{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-18.5, 19.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position -18.5, 19.5), boiler (position -13.5, 20.0), and offshore pump (position -11.5, 26.5). The steam engine is currently not connected to a power network and has no input liquid.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(-18.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position -18.0, -49.0) and a furnace at position (5.0, -73.0)\n\n### Copper cable factory at position(-21.5, 25.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine at position (-21.5, 25.5) and inserter that puts into the assembling machine\n- Beltgroup connecting the furnace at position (5.0, -73.0) to the assembling machine at position (-21.5, 25.5)\n\n### Lab at position(-17.5, 23.5)\nConsists of a lab (position -17.5, 23.5) that is currently not receiving power.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors related to boiler and steam engine connections\n- Check the positions of pipes and ensure they are correctly aligned to connect the boiler to the steam engine. \n\n### Errors related to inventory items\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into machines (e.g., coal for the boiler).\n\n### Errors with PipeGroup attributes\n- Verify that you are accessing the correct attributes of the PipeGroup object, as it appears that the 'fluid' attribute does not exist."}
