{"content": "# Factorio Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(12.928571428571429, 10.714285714285714)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Electricity group (position x=12.928571428571429, y=10.714285714285714) - Status: NOT_PLUGGED_IN_ELECTRIC_NETWORK\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(-28.5, -61.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position x1, y1)\n- Burner mining drill (position x2, y2)\n- Burner mining drill (position x3, y3)\n\n### Iron plate mine at position(-15.5, -50.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position x4, y4)\n- Burner mining drill (position x5, y5)\n- Burner mining drill (position x6, y6)\n\n### Stone furnace at position(0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position x=0.0, y=0.0) - Status: NO_INGREDIENTS\n- Stone furnace (position x=2.0, y=0.0) - Status: WORKING\n- Stone furnace (position x=2.0, y=2.0) - Status: NO_INGREDIENTS\n\n### Lab at position(10.5, 10.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab (position x=10.5, y=10.5) - Status: NO_POWER\n\n### Wooden chest at position(5.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest (position x=5.5, y=0.5) - Status: NORMAL\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when attempting to access entities\n- Ensure the entity you are trying to access exists at the specified position. For example, the error \"Could not get Prototype.Lab at position x=6.0 y=0.0\" indicates that there is no lab at that location.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity on a tile before attempting to place it.\n\n### Errors related to power connections\n- Ensure that all electrical entities are properly connected to the electric network to avoid issues like \"NOT_PLUGGED_IN_ELECTRIC_NETWORK\"."}
