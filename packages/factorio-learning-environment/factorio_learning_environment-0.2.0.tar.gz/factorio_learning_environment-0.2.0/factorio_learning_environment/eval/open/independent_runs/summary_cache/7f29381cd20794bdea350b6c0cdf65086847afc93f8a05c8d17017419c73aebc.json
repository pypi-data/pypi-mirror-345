{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Initial Iron Smelting Area at (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of two stone furnaces used for initial iron plate production:\n- First furnace at (0.0, 0.0)\n- Second furnace at (2.0, 0.0)\n\n### Automated Iron Mining & Smelting System at (-18.0, -49.0) and (-15.0, -50.0)\nTwo complete mining setups:\n\nFirst Setup:\n- Burner mining drill at (-18.0, -49.0)\n- Burner inserter at (-16.5, -47.5)\n- Wooden chest at (-15.5, -47.5) containing iron ore and plates\n\nSecond Setup:\n- Burner mining drill at (-15.0, -50.0)\n- Burner inserter at (-13.5, -48.5)\n- Wooden chest at (-12.5, -48.5) containing iron ore and plates\n\n### Copper Mining and Processing System\nMining Setup:\n- Two burner mining drills at (-28.0, -61.0) and (-28.0, -63.0)\n- Mining inserters at (-26.5, -59.5) and (-26.5, -61.5)\n\nSmelting Setup:\n- Two stone furnaces at (-27.0, -56.0) and (-27.0, -53.0)\n- Input inserters at (-28.5, -55.5) and (-28.5, -52.5)\n- Output inserters at (-25.5, -55.5) and (-25.5, -52.5)\n- Output chests at (-24.5, -55.5) and (-24.5, -52.5)\n\nTransport System:\n- Belt network connecting mining to smelting area with multiple belt groups\n- Main vertical belt line for ore transport\n- Secondary belt connections to furnace inputs\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Errors\n- Verify target position is clear before placing entities\n- Check for existing entities that might block placement\n- When placing inserters next to entities, ensure correct spacing and direction parameters\n\n### Transport Belt Issues\n- Ensure belt positions are properly cleared before attempting pickup\n- Verify belt connections are properly aligned with input/output positions\n- Monitor belt blockages and ensure proper item flow\n\n### Production Chain Blockages\n- Clear blocked transport belts to allow continued mining\n- Monitor \"waiting for space in destination\" warnings\n- Ensure proper spacing between connected components\n\n### Resource Management\n- Monitor fuel levels in all burner entities\n- Check inventory capacity before attempting to insert fuel\n- Ensure sufficient coal distribution across all machines\n\n### Entity Positioning and Orientation\n- Place inserters at exact drop positions of mining drills\n- Consider entity dimensions when planning layouts\n- Verify entity orientations match intended material flow direction\n\n### System Design\n- Clear existing structures completely before rebuilding\n- Ensure proper spacing between interconnected components\n- Verify all production chain connections before starting operation"}
