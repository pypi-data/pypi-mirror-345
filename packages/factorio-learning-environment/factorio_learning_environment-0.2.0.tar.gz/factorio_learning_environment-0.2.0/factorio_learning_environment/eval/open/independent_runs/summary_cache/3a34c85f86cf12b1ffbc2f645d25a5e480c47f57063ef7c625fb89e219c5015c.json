The pickup position should match the chest's position to avoid misalignment errors.\n- Verify that the inserter's drop position is aligned with the target entity, such as a furnace, to ensure proper item transfer.\n\n### Fuel Management for Inserters\n- Regularly check and refuel inserters to prevent them from running out of fuel, which can halt operations. Consider setting up an automated refueling system if possible.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Iron Ore\n- Check the setup of inserters to ensure they are correctly transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace. Misalignment or lack of fuel can cause the furnace to not receive necessary resources.\n\n### Coal Resource Management\n- Monitor coal levels closely and ensure a steady supply to fuel mining drills and inserters. Consider mining additional coal or redistributing existing coal to maintain operations."}
