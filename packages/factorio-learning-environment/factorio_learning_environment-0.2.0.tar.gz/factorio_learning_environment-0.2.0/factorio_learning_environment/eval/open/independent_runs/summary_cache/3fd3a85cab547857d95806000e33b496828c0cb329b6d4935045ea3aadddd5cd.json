{"content": "# FACTORIO AGENT REPORT\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System (x=-9.5, y=-0.5 to x=0.5, y=6.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore pump at position (x=-9.5, y=-0.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=-5.0, y=2.5)\n- Steam engine at position (x=0.5, y=6.5)\n- Pipe system connecting water from offshore pump to boiler\n- Pipe system connecting steam from boiler to steam engine\n- Small electric pole near steam engine\n\n### Coal Mining and Transport System (x=16.0, y=0.0 to x=-3.5, y=2.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (x=16.0, y=0.0)\n- Burner inserter at position (x=16.5, y=1.5) that moves coal from drill to chest\n- Wooden chest at position (x=16.5, y=2.5) for coal storage\n- Burner inserter at position (x=16.5, y=3.5) that moves coal from chest to transport belt\n- Transport belt system (22 belts) connecting from position (x=16.5, y=4.5) to position (x=-2.5, y=2.5)\n- Burner inserter at position (x=-3.5, y=2.5) that moves coal from belt to boiler\n\n### Iron Ore Mining System (x=16.5, y=70.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Electric mining drill at position (x=16.5, y=70.5)\n- Small electric pole at position (x=17.5, y=68.5) providing power to the drill\n- Wooden chest at position (x=16.5, y=72.5) collecting iron ore\n- Stone furnace at position (x=17.0, y=74.0) (currently not operational)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied spaces\n- Check if a position is already occupied before placing an entity\n- Use the entity's drop_position property to determine where items will be placed\n- Ensure there is enough space around entities when placing them\n\n### Errors when connecting entities with transport belts\n- Transport belts cannot connect directly from chests - you need to use an inserter as the source\n- Transport belts cannot connect directly to machines like boilers - you need to use an inserter as the target\n- Use inserters as intermediaries between storage/production entities and belts\n\n### Errors when placing entities near other structures\n- Check for collisions with existing entities before placement\n- Consider increasing spacing when using place_entity_next_to function\n- Be aware of the size of entities - some take up multiple tiles\n\n### Fuel and operational issues\n- Remember to add fuel to burner mining drills and furnaces\n- Monitor chest capacity - mining drills will stop when output chests are full"}
