{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\u2022 No new structures have been successfully built on the map. The agent made repeated attempts to supply a Lab at position (0.5, 2.5) and to craft or place one, but these efforts failed because the Lab item was not available in the inventory and the required sub\u2010components could not be produced. Although resource\u2010processing steps were undertaken using furnaces (an iron furnace at Position(x=5.0, y=5.0) and a copper furnace at Position(x=-27.0, y=-60.0)), these were retrieved from existing game elements rather than newly constructed.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 API Parameter Errors \u2013 When calling get_entities, use the correct signature. Verify that no unsupported keyword arguments (such as \u201cradius\u201d) or extra positional arguments are supplied.\n\u2022 Lab Placement Without Inventory \u2013 Ensure that the Lab item is present in the inventory before attempting to place it at (0.5, 2.5).\n\u2022 NoneType Iteration \u2013 Before iterating over the results from functions like get_entities, check that a valid, non\u2010None list is returned (e.g., default to an empty list if necessary).\n\u2022 Lab Crafting Resource Shortages \u2013 Confirm that the entire supply chain for Lab components is met. This includes having sufficient iron plates (to produce iron-gear-wheels) and copper plates (for copper-cables and electronic circuits) so that all sub-ingredient requirements for crafting a Lab are fulfilled."}
