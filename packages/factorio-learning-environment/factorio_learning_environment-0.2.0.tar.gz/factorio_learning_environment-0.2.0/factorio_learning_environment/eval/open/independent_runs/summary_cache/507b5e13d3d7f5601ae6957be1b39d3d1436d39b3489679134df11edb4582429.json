This will ensure continuous operation and avoid warnings related to being out of fuel.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Make sure that the source entity has items available for the inserter to pick up. This will prevent the inserter from being in a waiting state and ensure smooth item transfer operations."}
