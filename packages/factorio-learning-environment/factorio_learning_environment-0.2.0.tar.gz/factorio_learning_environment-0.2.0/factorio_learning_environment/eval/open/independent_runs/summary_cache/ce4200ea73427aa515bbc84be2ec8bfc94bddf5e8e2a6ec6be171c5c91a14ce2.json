{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (22.5, -7.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (22.5, -7.5)\n- Boiler at position (20.5, -4.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (4.5, -10.5) and another at (19.5, -1.5)\n- Pipe network connecting these components\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Two Stone Furnaces at positions (0.0, 0.0) and (2.0, 0.0)\n\n### Copper Cable Factory\nConsists of:\n- Assembling Machine at position (10.5, 0.5)\n- Inserters and Small Electric Poles for item transfer and power distribution\n- Belt group connecting the furnace output to the assembling machine\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-11.0, 20.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (-11.5, 18.5) for storing mined iron ore\n\n### Miscellaneous Storage\n- Wooden Chests at positions (-3.5, 0.5) and (-3.5, 2.5) for general storage\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities without Inventory\n- Ensure you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to place an entity. For example, attempting to place a burner mining drill without having one in inventory will result in an error.\n\n### Errors Related to Power Supply\n- Check that all electrical entities are connected to a power source and that the power source is operational. Many entities are not receiving electricity, which can be resolved by ensuring proper connections and fuel supply to the power generation units.\n\n### Errors Due to Missing Ingredients\n- Ensure that all required ingredients are available for production processes. For instance, the assembling machine cannot produce copper cables due to a lack of copper plates.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Operations\n- Verify that inserters have a source item to pick up and are connected to a power supply. Inserters waiting for source items or not receiving electricity will not function correctly."}
