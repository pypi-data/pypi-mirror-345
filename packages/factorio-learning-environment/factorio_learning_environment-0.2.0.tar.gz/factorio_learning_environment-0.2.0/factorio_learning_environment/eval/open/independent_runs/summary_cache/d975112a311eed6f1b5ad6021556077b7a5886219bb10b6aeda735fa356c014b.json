{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Mining and Smelting System at (-18.0, -53.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-18.0, -53.0)\n- Stone furnace at (-17.0, -51.0)\nCurrently working but furnace has no fuel and is full of iron plates (19)\n\n### Copper Mining and Smelting System at (-21.0, -73.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-21.0, -73.0)\n- Stone furnace at (-20.0, -71.0)\nCurrently waiting for output space, furnace contains copper plates (14)\n\n### Power Generation System at (-14.5, 19.0)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Boiler at (-14.5, 19.0)\n- Steam engine at (-8.5, 19.5)\n- Multiple pipe groups connecting components\nSystem is partially working:\n- Offshore pump is working and outputting water\n- Boiler and steam engine are not properly connected yet\n- Complex pipe network present but most pipe groups are empty\n\n### Research Lab System\nConsists of:\n- Lab with automation science packs (10)\nCurrently not operational due to no power\n\n### Unused Smelting Area\nGroup of 4 unused furnaces at:\n- (0.0, 0.0)\n- (2.0, 0.0)\n- (2.0, 4.0)\n- (4.0, 4.0)\nAll have fuel (23 coal each) but no ingredients\n\n### Electricity Distribution Network\nElectric pole network (Group ID 1656) connecting various areas but currently not operational (0 voltage)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Power System Connection Issues\n- Ensure proper fluid connections between offshore pump, boiler and steam engine\n- Verify pipe connections are continuous and not blocked\n- Check that connection points between components are properly aligned\n\n### Production Line Blockages\n- Mining drills are getting blocked due to full output furnaces\n- Implement a system to regularly clear furnace outputs to prevent production stoppage\n\n### Resource Extraction Errors\n- Attempting to extract iron ore from copper furnaces - verify correct furnace identification before extraction\n- Ensure proper resource type matching when extracting from furnaces\n\n### Power Distribution\n- Lab and other electrical components have no power\n- Ensure power generation system is properly connected and operational before expanding electrical network\n\n### Fuel Management\n- Some furnaces are running out of fuel while others have excess\n- Implement better fuel distribution system across all fuel-consuming entities"}
