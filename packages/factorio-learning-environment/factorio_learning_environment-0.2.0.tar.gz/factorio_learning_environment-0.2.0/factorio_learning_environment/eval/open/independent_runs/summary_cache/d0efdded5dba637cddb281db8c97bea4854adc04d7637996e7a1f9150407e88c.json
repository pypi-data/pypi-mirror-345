{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-0.5, 25.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (-0.5, 25.5)\n- Boiler at position (-5.5, 25.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting Offshore Pump to Boiler with pipes at positions [(x=-8.5, y=23.5), (x=-9.5, y=23.5), (x=-7.5, y=23.5), (x=-7.5, y=25.5), (x=-7.5, y=24.5)]\n- PipeGroup connecting Boiler to Steam Engine with pipes at positions [(x=-5.5, y=23.5), (x=-4.5, y=23.5), (x=-3.5, y=23.5), ..., (x=-2.5, y=22.5), (x=-1.5, y=22.5), (x=-0.5, y=22.5)]\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (15.0, 0.0) with iron ore input and iron plate output\n\n### Inserter and Power Network\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Inserter at position (17.5, 0.5) connected to a power network\n- Small Electric Pole network connecting the Inserter and Steam Engine\n\n### Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (5.5, 0.5)\n- Wooden Chest at position (18.5, 0.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Entities Without Required Items\n- Ensure you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to connect entities. This includes pipes for fluid connections and small electric poles for electrical connections.\n\n### Errors Due to Insufficient Materials for Crafting\n- Check your inventory for required materials before attempting to craft items. Plan resource gathering to ensure you have enough materials for crafting essential items like Small Electric Poles.\n\n### Errors when Inserting Items Without Inventory\n- Verify that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities like Boilers. Regularly check your inventory levels and gather resources as needed.\n\n### Inserter Power Issues\n- Ensure that all inserters are connected to a power source and that the power network is operational. Regularly check the status of inserters to ensure they are powered and functioning correctly."}
