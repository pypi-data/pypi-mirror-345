{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Furnace Setup at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with fuel inventory containing coal and a furnace source inventory containing iron ore.\n\n### Laboratory Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab with input for automation science packs, currently without power.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items into a full inventory\n- Ensure that the target inventory has enough space before attempting to insert items. For example, the stone furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) was full when attempting to insert iron plates.\n\n### Errors when inserting incompatible items\n- Verify that the item type is compatible with the target entity before insertion. An attempt was made to insert iron plates into a stone furnace already containing iron ore.\n\n### Errors when extracting from non-existent entities\n- Confirm the presence of the target entity and its contents before attempting extraction. Attempts were made to extract iron ore and iron plates from a stone furnace without the respective items.\n\n### Errors due to missing items in inventory\n- Check that the required items are present in your inventory before attempting to use or place them. For instance, there was an attempt to place an offshore pump without having one in the inventory.\n\n### Errors when crafting without unlocked technology\n- Ensure that the necessary technology is researched before attempting to craft items that require it, such as the solar panel.\n\n### Errors when crafting with missing ingredients\n- Make sure all required ingredients are available in the inventory before crafting. For example, crafting a steam engine failed due to missing iron plates.\n\n### Errors when crafting with unavailable recipes\n- Verify that the recipe for the item or its components is available and unlocked. Crafting a boiler failed because the recipe for stone, a raw resource, was not available."}
