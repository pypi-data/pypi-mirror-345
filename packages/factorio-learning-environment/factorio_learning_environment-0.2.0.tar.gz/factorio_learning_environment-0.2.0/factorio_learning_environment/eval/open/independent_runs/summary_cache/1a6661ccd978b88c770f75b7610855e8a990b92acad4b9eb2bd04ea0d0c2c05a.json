{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report (Steps 40-47)\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at position (-18.5, 69.5)\n(Now operational with fuel)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump (position x=-18.5 y=69.5) - working\n- Boiler (position x=-4.5 y=50.0) - now fueled with coal\n- Steam engine (position x=0.5 y=50.5) - connected and working\n- Connected with pipe groups:\n  - Water pipes from pump to boiler (positions: x=-18.5,y=68.5; x=-18.5,y=67.5; x=-6.5,y=50.5; x=-6.5,y=51.5)\n  - Steam pipes from boiler to engine (positions: x=-4.5,y=48.5; x=-3.5,y=48.5; x=0.5,y=47.5)\n- Power pole network (positions: x=0.5,y=53.5; x=30.5,y=52.5) - voltage restored\n\n### Stone Mining and Smelting Operation at position (-49.5, 10.5)\n(Unchanged from previous report)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill (position x=-49.5 y=10.5)\n- Stone furnace (position x=-46.0 y=11.0)\n- Input inserter (position x=-47.5 y=10.5)\n- Output chest (position x=-44.5 y=11.5)\n- Power pole (position x=-46.5 y=12.5)\n\n### New Stone Mining Operation at position (-46.5, -0.5)\n(Rebuilt but with connection issues)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill (position x=-46.5 y=-0.5) - output blocked\n- Stone furnace (position x=-43.0 y=0.0) - missing\n- Input inserter (position x=-44.5 y=-0.5) - power connection failed\n- Power pole (position x=-46.5 y=1.5) - connected to main grid\n- Power pole (position x=-46.5 y=3.5) - duplicate placement\n- Missing output chest (was at x=-41.5 y=0.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Power connection failures (new critical issue)\n- Multiple power connection attempts failing (steps 41, 44, 47)\n  - Clear existing entities before placing new poles\n  - Verify pole spacing requirements (9-11 tiles max)\n  - Check for obstructions between poles and devices\n\n### Entity placement distance (recurring)\n- Still attempting placements from too far (steps 40, 46)\n  - Move within 10 tiles before placing (current distance 10.77)\n  - Implement position verification before placement\n  - Use teleport for distant builds when necessary\n\n### Entity reference management (recurring)\n- Lost references to key entities (steps 42, 43, 45)\n  - Maintain entity tracking system\n  - Verify entity existence before operations\n  - Handle entity replacement gracefully\n\n### Production chain issues (recurring)\n- Multiple points of failure in new mining operation\n  - Drill output blocked (step 47)\n  - Missing furnace (step 45)\n  - Inserter connection failed (step 41)\n  - Solution approach:\n    1. Clear blocked output first\n    2. Rebuild missing furnace\n    3. Verify all connections\n    4. Add output chest\n\n### Duplicate placement attempts (new)\n- Attempting to place poles where they exist (step 47)\n  - Check for existing entities before placement\n  - Remove old entities before replacement\n  - Maintain placement position records\n\n### System verification gaps (recurring)\n- Missing validation after rebuilds (throughout)\n  - Add verification after each placement\n  - Check power status of new entities\n  - Validate production chain connectivity\n\n### Blocked connections (new)\n- Multiple connection failures due to obstructions (steps 41, 44)\n  - Clear space around connection points\n  - Verify clear path between connected entities\n  - Check for ground items blocking connections"}
