{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Manufacturing Area (around position 0,0)\nConsists of multiple furnaces and assemblers:\n- Stone furnaces at positions (0,0), (2,0), (5,0), (8,0) with varying coal fuel levels\n- Burner inserter at (3.5,0.5) connecting furnaces\n- Wooden chests at (4.5,1.5) and (8.5,1.5) for storage\n- Inserter at (9.5,1.5) for automation\n- Assembling machine at (11.5,1.5) for automation science pack production\n- Output inserter at (13.5,1.5) and storage chest at (14.5,1.5)\n\n### Secondary Production Area (around position 4,4)\n- Stone furnaces at (4,4) and (6,4) with coal fuel\n- Inserter at (4.5,2.5) for automation\n- Connected by belt system for material transport\n\n### Research Lab Complex\nMultiple labs in various positions, currently without power:\n- Several labs with varying amounts of automation science packs stored (56, 110, 31 packs)\n- Additional empty labs ready for research\n\n### Power Generation System (in progress)\n- Offshore pump at (-7.5,25.5)\n- Boiler placement attempts at various positions (latest at -6.0,24.5)\n- Currently non-functional due to placement issues\n\n### Transport Infrastructure\nMultiple belt groups forming a logistics network:\n- Belt group from (4.5,2.5) to (2.5,2.5)\n- Belt group from (6.5,2.5) to (4.5,2.5)\n- Long belt group from (7.5,3.5) to (-4.5,19.5)\n- Belt group from (1.5,5.5) to (1.5,11.5)\n\n### Electrical Network\nNon-functional electricity group (id=41305) with multiple poles spanning positions from (-12.5,16.5) to (7.5,7.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Power System Placement Errors\n- Ensure target location is within reach (max distance is 10 units from player position)\n- Avoid placing boilers over water tiles\n- Verify correct orientation of power system components before placement\n\n### Entity Connection Errors\n- Connect power poles to form complete electrical networks\n- Ensure inserters and assembling machines are connected to power\n- Verify fluid connections between offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine\n\n### Fuel Management Errors\n- Verify fuel is in inventory before attempting to insert into entities\n- Ensure you are close enough to entity when inserting fuel\n- Check that the entity can accept the type of fuel you're trying to insert\n\n### Resource Extraction Errors\n- Move within range of target entity before attempting to extract resources\n- Verify the entity contains the resource you're trying to extract\n\n### Entity Placement Errors\n- Check for entity collisions before placement\n- Ensure proper spacing between components\n- Verify ground conditions are suitable for placement"}
