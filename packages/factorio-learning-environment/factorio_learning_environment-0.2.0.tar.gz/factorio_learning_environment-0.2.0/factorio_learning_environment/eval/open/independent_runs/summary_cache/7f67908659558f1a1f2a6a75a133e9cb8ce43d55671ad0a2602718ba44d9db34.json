{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll generate a report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Smelting System (around y=-80)\nComplex setup consisting of:\n- Input chest at (45.5, -79.5) containing iron ore\n- Two stone furnaces at (45.0, -81.0) and (47.0, -81.0)\n- Output chest at (49.5, -80.5) containing iron plates\n- Two burner inserters at (44.5, -79.5) and (46.5, -79.5)\nCurrent status: System is set up but experiencing issues with inserter placement and rotation\n\n### Coal Mining Setup (around y=-82)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0) mining coal\n- Multiple storage chests:\n  - Two iron chests at (41.5, -84.5) and (41.5, -83.5) storing coal\n  - Wooden chest at (41.5, -80.5) for coal collection\nCurrent status: System is full/backed up with coal\n\n### Additional Storage\n- Wooden chest at (45.5, -84.5) - empty\n- Various chests containing materials:\n  - Iron plates (1500) stored in chest at (49.5, -80.5)\n  - Coal stored across multiple chests (1600 in each iron chest)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Conflicts\n- Multiple failed attempts to place inserters due to existing objects in target locations\n- Before placing entities, verify the target location is clear of other entities\n- Use proper coordinate calculations to avoid overlap with existing structures\n\n### Resource Management\n- Coal mining system is backing up due to full chests\n- Implement a better storage management system to prevent backups\n- Consider adding warning detection for full storage situations\n\n### Inserter Configuration\n- Multiple attempts needed to get correct inserter rotation and placement\n- Ensure proper calculation of pickup and drop positions before placing inserters\n- Verify inserter orientation matches the intended material flow direction\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nFunctions:\n- place_entity(): Used for placing game entities, fails when target location is occupied\n\nImportant Variables:\n- first_inserter: BurnerInserter type\n- second_inserter: BurnerInserter type"}
