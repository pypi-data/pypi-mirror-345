{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Basic Steam Power Generation at x=-5.5 y=2.0\nThis setup generates electricity using steam. It was refueled multiple times but remains structurally unchanged.\n-   **Components:**\n    -   Offshore Pump at x=-9.5 y=-0.5 (Extracts water)\n    -   PipeGroup connecting pump to boiler (Transport water)\n        -   Pipes at: (x=-8.5,y=-0.5), (x=-7.5,y=-0.5), (x=-7.5,y=0.5), (x=-7.5,y=1.5)\n    -   Boiler at x=-5.5 y=2.0 (Heats water into steam using fuel)\n    -   Wooden Chest at x=-2.5 y=1.5 (Stores fuel for the boiler)\n    -   Burner Inserter at x=-3.5 y=1.5 (Moves fuel from chest to boiler)\n    -   Steam Engine at x=-2.5 y=5.5 (Consumes steam to generate electricity)\n    -   PipeGroup connecting boiler to steam engine (Transport steam)\n        -   Pipes at: (x=-5.5,y=3.5), (x=-2.5,y=2.5), ... (multiple pipes connecting)\n    -   ElectricityGroup connecting the steam engine to consumers (Distributes power)\n        -   Poles at: (x=13.5,y=17.5), ..., (x=17.5,y=76.5)\n\n### Iron Plate and Gear Production at x=18.0 y=75.0\nThis setup mines iron ore, smelts it into plates, and attempts to assemble iron gear wheels.\n-   **Components:**\n    -   Electric Mining Drill at x=17.5 y=72.5 (Mines iron ore)\n    -   Stone Furnace at x=18.0 y=75.0 (Smelts iron ore into iron plates)\n    -   Inserter at x=19.5 y=75.5 (Moves coal from chest to furnace - currently inactive/misconfigured as chest is empty)\n    -   Wooden Chest at x=20.5 y=75.5 (Intended for furnace fuel)\n    -   Inserter at x=18.5 y=77.5 (Attempts"}
