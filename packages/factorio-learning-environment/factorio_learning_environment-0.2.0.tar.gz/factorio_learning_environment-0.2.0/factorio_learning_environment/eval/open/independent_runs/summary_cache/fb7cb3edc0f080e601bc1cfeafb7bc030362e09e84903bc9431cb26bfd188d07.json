For example, the `BeltGroup` object does not have a `direction` attribute. Verify object documentation or definitions before accessing attributes.\n\n### Incorrect Argument Types in Function Calls\n- When using functions like `get_entities`, ensure that the arguments match the expected types. For instance, the second argument in `get_entities` should be a Position object, not a string like 'player'. Always refer to the function's documentation for correct usage.\n\n### Fuel Management for Mining Drills and Furnaces\n- Ensure that all Burner Mining Drills and Stone Furnaces have sufficient fuel to operate. Regularly check fuel levels and replenish them to avoid production halts.\n\n### Ingredient Supply for Furnaces\n- Ensure that Stone Furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Check the supply lines and ensure that raw materials are being delivered to the furnaces.\n\n### Inserter Source Item Availability\n- Burner Inserters should have source items available to pick up. Ensure that the supply chain is functioning correctly and that items are being transported to the inserters."}
