{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -50.0) used for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-12.5, -49.5) which is responsible for transferring items between the furnace and a wooden chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-11.5, -49.5) used for storing produced iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Lack of Inventory Items\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into a structure. For example, attempting to insert iron ore or coal without having them in your inventory will result in an error.\n\n### Errors when Inserter Alignment is Incorrect\n- Verify the alignment of inserters to ensure they are correctly positioned to pick up and drop items between entities. Misalignment can cause the inserter to fail in transferring items.\n\n### Errors when Furnace is Out of Fuel or Ingredients\n- Regularly check the fuel and ingredient levels in furnaces to prevent them from running out, which can halt production. Ensure a steady supply of fuel and raw materials to maintain continuous operation."}
