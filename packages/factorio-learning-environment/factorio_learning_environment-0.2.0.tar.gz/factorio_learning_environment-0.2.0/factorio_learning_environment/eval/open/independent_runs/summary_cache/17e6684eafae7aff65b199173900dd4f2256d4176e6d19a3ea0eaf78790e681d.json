{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (5.0, -73.0)\nConsists of the following entity:\n- Stone Furnace at position (5.0, -73.0) with coal as fuel. Currently, it has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities without having them in inventory\n- Ensure that you have the required entity in your inventory before attempting to place it. For example, attempting to place a stone furnace at position (4.5, -73.5) failed because there was no stone furnace in the inventory.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient crafting materials\n- Verify that you have all necessary materials before crafting an item. For instance, crafting a stone furnace requires 5 stones, but the inventory had 0 stones, leading to an AssertionError. Always check material requirements against your current inventory.\n\n### Errors due to incorrect fuel insertion\n- Ensure that the correct amount of fuel is inserted into entities. An AssertionError occurred because the expected amount of coal to be inserted was 10, but the insertion did not meet the expected condition. Double-check the fuel requirements and insertion logic to avoid such errors."}
