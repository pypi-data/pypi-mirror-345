{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line (Position x=1-3, y=1-3.5)\nConsists of:\n- Two stone furnaces at (1.0, 1.0) and (3.0, 1.0)\n- Two burner inserters at (1.5, 2.5) and (3.5, 2.5)\n- Two wooden chests storing iron plates at (1.5, 3.5) and (3.5, 3.5)\n\n### Additional Storage (Position x=5.5, y=2.5-3.5)\nConsists of:\n- One wooden chest at (5.5, 3.5)\n- One burner inserter at (5.5, 2.5)\n\n### Copper Plate Production Line (Position x=2-4.5, y=7-9.5)\nConsists of:\n- Two stone furnaces at (2.0, 7.0) and (4.0, 7.0)\n- Two burner inserters at (2.5, 8.5) and (4.5, 8.5)\n- Two wooden chests storing copper plates at (2.5, 9.5) and (4.5, 9.5)\n\n### Power Generation System (Position x=2.5-13.5, y=33.5-37.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at (2.5, 35.5)\n- Boiler at (7.0, 35.5)\n- Steam engine at (13.5, 35.5)\n- Two pipe groups connecting components:\n  - Water pipe system at (5.5, 33.5) connecting pump to boiler\n  - Steam pipe system at (8.5, 35.5) connecting boiler to steam engine\n- Electricity distribution network with multiple poles connecting power consumers\n\n### Research Facility\nConsists of:\n- Lab at (6.5, 16.5)\n- Connected to the power grid via electric pole at (4.26, 20.74)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing structures at invalid locations\n- Before placing structures, verify that the target location is clear and suitable\n- The first attempt to place the lab at (29.0, 42.0) failed because the location was invalid\n- Choose locations that are within the buildable area and not occupied by other entities\n\n### Power system optimization\n- Boiler is currently out of fuel and not operating\n- Ensure fuel is loaded into the boiler to maintain power generation\n- Steam engine shows \"no input liquid\" warning, indicating the steam transport system needs attention\n\n### Production line efficiency\n- Multiple furnaces show \"no ingredients to smelt\" warning\n- Ensure proper supply of raw materials to keep production lines operating continuously"}
