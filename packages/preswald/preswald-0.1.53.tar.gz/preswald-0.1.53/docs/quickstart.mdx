- **`.gitignore`**: Pre-configured to exclude sensitive files from version control.

</Step>

  <Step title="Write Your First App">

Open `hello.py` and edit it with the following content:

```python
from preswald import text

text("# Welcome to Preswald")
```

#### Run It Locally

Launch your app locally with this command:

```bash
preswald run
```

Open your browser and navigate to **[http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501)**. Your app will be live, ready for you to explore and iterate on.

```bash
preswald deploy --target structured
