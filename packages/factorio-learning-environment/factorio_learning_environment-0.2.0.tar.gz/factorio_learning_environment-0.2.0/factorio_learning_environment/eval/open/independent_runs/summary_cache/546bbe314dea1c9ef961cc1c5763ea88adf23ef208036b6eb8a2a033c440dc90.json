{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (x=40.5, y=-83.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0) extracting coal\n- Transport Belt connecting the mining drill to a series of wooden chests\n- Wooden Chests at positions (x=40.5, y=-83.5), (x=41.5, y=-83.5), and (x=42.5, y=-83.5) for coal storage\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) for smelting\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=1.5, y=0.5) transferring items into a wooden chest\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=2.5, y=0.5) for intermediate storage\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=3.5, y=0.5) moving items from the chest to a transport belt\n- Transport Belt group from (x=3.5, y=0.5) to (x=5.5, y=0.5) connecting to the production line\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=20.5, y=0.5) storing iron plates\n\n### Copper Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=10.0, y=0.0) for smelting\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=11.5, y=0.5) transferring items into a wooden chest\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=12.5, y=0.5) storing copper plates\n\n### Additional Storage\n- Wooden Chests at positions (x=7.5, y=0.5), (x=22.5, y=0.5), (x=24.5, y=0.5), (x=26.5, y=0.5), (x=28.5, y=0.5), (x=30.5, y=0.5), (x=32.5, y=0.5), (x=34.5, y=0.5), (x=36.5, y=0.5), (x=38.5, y=0.5), (x=40.5, y=0.5) for various materials including coal, iron plates, and copper plates\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Removing Chest\n- Ensure that the chest object is correctly referenced and callable when attempting to remove it.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source items are available for the inserter to process. Check the supply chain to ensure materials are reaching the inserter.\n\n### Chest Full Warnings\n- Regularly check and clear out chests that are full to prevent bottlenecks in production and resource gathering.\n\n### No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Ensure that the furnaces have the necessary ingredients to process. Check the supply lines to ensure raw materials are being delivered to the furnaces.\n\nBy addressing these errors, the efficiency and effectiveness of the production lines and resource management can be improved significantly."}
