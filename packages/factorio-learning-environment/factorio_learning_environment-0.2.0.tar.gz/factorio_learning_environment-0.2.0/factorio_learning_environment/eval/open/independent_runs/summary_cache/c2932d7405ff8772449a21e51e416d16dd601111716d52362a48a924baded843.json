{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) extracting iron ore, with a drop position at (-14.5, -48.5).\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-14.0, -48.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-14.5, -46.5) transferring iron ore from the mining drill to the furnace.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-12.5, -47.5) transferring iron plates from the furnace to a wooden chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-11.5, -47.5) storing iron plates.\n\n### Additional Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0) currently inactive due to no ingredients to smelt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Misalignment Errors\n- Ensure that the inserter's pickup and drop positions align correctly with the source and target entities to avoid misalignment issues.\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities on Occupied Tiles\n- Before placing an entity, check that the target tile is unoccupied to prevent placement errors.\n\n### Errors Due to Distance Limitations\n- Move closer to the target position before attempting to place an entity to avoid distance-related placement errors.\n\n### Inventory Errors\n- Ensure the required items are available in the inventory before attempting to place an entity, such as a wooden chest.\n\n### Output Blockage\n- Regularly clear items blocking the output of the mining drill to maintain continuous production."}
