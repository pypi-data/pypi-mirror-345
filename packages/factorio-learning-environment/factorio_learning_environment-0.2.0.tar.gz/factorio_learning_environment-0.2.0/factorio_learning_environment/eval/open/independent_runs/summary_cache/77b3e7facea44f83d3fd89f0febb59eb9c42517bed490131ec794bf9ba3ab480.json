{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-29.5, 30.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position -29.5, 30.5), boiler (position -24.5, -50.0) and offshore pump (position -10.5, 25.5).\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(-18.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace (position -18.0, -49.0) with coal as fuel and producing copper plates.\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace (position -18.0, -49.0) for smelting copper ore into copper plates.\n- Assembling machine (position not specified) for crafting copper cables.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to inventory management\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities. In this case, coal was needed for the furnace but was not available initially.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity on a tile before attempting to place it. \n\n### Errors related to power supply\n- Ensure that all power-consuming entities (like the steam engine and lab) are connected to a power network to avoid issues with them being non-functional."}
