For example, attempting to place a stone furnace without having it in your inventory will result in an error.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient crafting materials\n- Verify that you have all the required materials in your inventory before attempting to craft an item. For instance, crafting a stone furnace requires 5 stones, and attempting to craft it without sufficient stones will cause an error.\n\n### Errors when trying to find non-existent entities\n- Ensure that the entity you are trying to locate exists on the map. For example, attempting to find the nearest stone furnace when none has been placed will result in an error.\n\n### Errors due to lack of fuel or ingredients in furnaces\n- Make sure to have the necessary fuel and ingredients in your inventory before attempting to use a furnace. For instance, trying to insert coal into a furnace without having coal in your inventory will cause an error.\n\n### Errors when attempting to use unavailable furnaces\n- Ensure that you have additional stone furnaces available in your inventory before attempting to place or use them. An assertion error will occur if you try to use a furnace when none are available in your inventory.\n\n### Errors when inserting items without having them in inventory\n- Ensure you have the items you wish to insert into a structure in your inventory. For example, attempting to insert iron ore into a furnace without having iron ore in your inventory will result in an error."}
