{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Transport System at Position (x=41.0, y=-82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0) connected to a wooden chest at position (x=40.5, y=-83.5) for coal storage.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=41.5, y=-83.5) transferring coal from the mining drill to the chest.\n- Transport belts starting from position (x=42.5, y=-81.5) facilitating coal movement.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Two Stone Furnaces at positions (x=61.0, y=-54.0) and (x=64.0, y=-53.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserters at positions (x=62.5, y=-53.5) and (x=65.5, y=-52.5) for moving materials into and out of the furnaces.\n- A wooden chest at position (x=61.5, y=-52.5) for storing intermediate materials.\n\n### Belt Systems\nConsists of multiple BeltGroups:\n- BeltGroup connecting (x=45.5, y=-82.5) to (x=67.5, y=-54.5) with 51 belts.\n- BeltGroup connecting (x=43.5, y=-80.5) to (x=63.5, y=-50.5) with 51 belts.\n- BeltGroup connecting (x=42.5, y=-81.5) to (x=65.5, y=-46.5) with 67 belts.\n- BeltGroup connecting (x=44.5, y=-81.5) to (x=65.5, y=-54.5) with 49 belts.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Belt Connections\n- Ensure that the path for connecting belts is valid and clear of obstacles. The repeated failure to connect belts from position (x=43.5, y=-81.5) to positions (x=65.0, y=-51.0) and (x=66.0, y=-51.0) indicates an invalid path. Verify the path and adjust the layout to ensure successful connections.\n\n### Repeated Clearing of Belt Groups\n- Frequent clearing of belt groups may indicate underlying pathing issues. Regularly review the belt layout to prevent unnecessary clearing and ensure efficient transport routes.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n- No utility functions or specific variables were defined or invoked in the provided logs."}
