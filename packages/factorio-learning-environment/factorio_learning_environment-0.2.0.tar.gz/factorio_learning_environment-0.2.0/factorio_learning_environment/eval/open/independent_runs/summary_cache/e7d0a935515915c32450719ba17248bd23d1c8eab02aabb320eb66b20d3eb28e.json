{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (52.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (52.0, -82.0) extracting coal, connected to a wooden chest at position (53.5, -80.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (53.5, -80.5) storing coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (52.5, -79.5) transferring coal from the wooden chest at (53.5, -80.5) to another wooden chest at (52.5, -78.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -78.5) storing coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (53.5, -78.5) transferring coal from the wooden chest at (52.5, -78.5) to another wooden chest at (54.5, -78.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (54.5, -78.5) storing coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (54.5, -79.5) with warnings about blocked output.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-12.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-12.0, -51.0) extracting iron ore, connected to a wooden chest at position (-11.5, -49.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (-11.5, -49.5) storing iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-11.5, -48.5) transferring iron ore from the wooden chest at (-11.5, -49.5) to a stone furnace at (-14.0, -49.0).\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Additional Storage and Inserters\n- Wooden Chest at position (-9.5, -49.5) connected to a burner inserter at (-9.5, -48.5).\n- Burner Inserter at position (-9.5, -48.5) with warnings about being out of fuel.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-13.5, -45.5) connected to a burner inserter at (-13.5, -46.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Chests\n- Ensure that the target location for placing a wooden chest is unoccupied. Check for existing objects that might block placement.\n\n### Errors when Connecting Chests with Inserters\n- Verify that there is enough spacing and no existing inserters at the target position before attempting to place a new burner-inserter.\n- Ensure that the inventory has enough items to place the required entities.\n\n### Errors due to Inventory Management\n- Regularly clear inventory space to avoid crafting failures due to lack of available slots.\n\n### Errors with Undefined Variables\n- Make sure all variables, such as 'new_iron_ore_chest', are properly defined before using them in operations.\n\n### Inserter Output Blockages\n- Ensure there is a sink entity to accept outputs from inserters to avoid blockages.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the count of various items in the player's inventory.\n- `new_iron_ore_chest`: Undefined - Attempted use without prior definition."}
