{"content": "Based on the execution logs and entity data, I'll generate a comprehensive report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining Station at (41.0, -82.0)\n- Burner mining drill positioned at (41.0, -82.0)\n- Two iron chests for coal storage:\n  - At (41.5, -84.5) containing 1600 coal\n  - At (41.5, -83.5) containing 797 coal\n\n### Iron Smelting Complex (45.0-47.0, -81.0)\nTwo parallel smelting lines:\n1. Left smelting line:\n   - Stone furnace at (45.0, -81.0)\n   - Burner inserter at (45.5, -82.5)\n   - Output wooden chest at (45.5, -83.5) containing 8 iron plates\n   - Output wooden chest at (45.5, -84.5)\n\n2. Right smelting line:\n   - Stone furnace at (47.0, -81.0)\n   - Burner inserter at (47.5, -82.5)\n   - Output wooden chest at (47.5, -83.5) containing 117 iron plates\n\n### Input Distribution System at (46.5, -79.5)\n- Input wooden chest at (46.5, -77.5) containing iron ore\n- Burner inserter at (46.5, -78.5)\n- Transport belt at (46.5, -79.5)\n\n### Storage Area\n- Wooden chest at (49.5, -80.5) containing 800 coal\n- Wooden chest at (49.5, -79.5) containing 50 coal and 1500 iron plates\n\nERROR TIPS\n1. Entity Placement Conflicts\n   - Always check for existing entities before placing new ones\n   - Ensure target location is clear of other entities and valid terrain\n   - When placing connected structures (like belts), verify all required spaces are available\n\n2. Belt System Issues\n   - Clear blocked belts before attempting to feed items onto them\n   - Ensure proper spacing between belts and inserters\n   - Verify belt directions are correctly oriented for the intended flow\n\n3. Resource Management\n   - Monitor fuel levels in burner devices\n   - Ensure input chests have sufficient materials\n   - Clear full output chests to prevent backups\n\nNAMESPACE\nFunctions:\n- `place_entity()`: Places entities on the map\n  - Failures: Location conflicts, invalid terrain\n  - Success: When placement location is clear and valid\n\nVariables:\n- `input_belt`: transport-belt\n- `left_belt`: transport-belt\n- `right_belt`: transport-belt\n- `left_inserter`: burner-inserter\n- `right_inserter`: burner-inserter"}
