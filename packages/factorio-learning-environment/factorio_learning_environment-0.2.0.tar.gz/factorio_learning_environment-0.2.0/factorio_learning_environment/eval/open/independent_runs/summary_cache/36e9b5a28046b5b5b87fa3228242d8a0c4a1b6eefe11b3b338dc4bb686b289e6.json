{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-46.5, -119.0)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (-40.5, -113.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-46.5, -119.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\n- Pipe network connecting these components for fluid transfer\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-15.0, -76.0) with a Wooden Chest at Position (-15.5, -77.5) for ore collection\n- Stone Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-19.0, -73.0) for smelting copper ore into copper plates\n\n### Inserter and Storage System\nConsists of:\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) connected to a Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0) and Wooden Chests at Positions (7.5, -61.5) and (6.5, -59.5)\n\n### Research Lab\nConsists of:\n- Lab with input of automation science packs, currently not conducting research\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- Multiple PipeGroups for fluid transport, with notable working systems at positions (-48.5, -122.5) and (-46.5, -120.5)\n\n### Electricity Network\n- Small Electric Poles distributed across various positions, providing power to connected entities\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Insufficient Inventory Items\n- Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into structures. In this case, ensure you have sufficient coal before trying to insert it into a boiler.\n\n### Errors with Fuel Management\n- Regularly check and refuel mining drills and furnaces to prevent them from running out of fuel and halting production.\n\n### Errors with Full Storage\n- Monitor and manage the inventory of storage entities like chests to prevent them from becoming full, which can block production lines.\n\n### Errors with No Ingredients to Process\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary raw materials to process, preventing them from idling with no ingredients to smelt."}
