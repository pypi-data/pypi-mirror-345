{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Coal mining drill at position(x=43.0, y=-82.0)\nConsists of a burner mining drill at position(x=43.0, y=-82.0), a furnace at position(x=41.0, y=-82.0), and a chest at position(x=42.5, y=-83.5) to store the mined coal.\n\n### Coal transportation system at position(x=43.5, y=-80.5)\nConsists of a burner inserter at position(x=43.5, y=-80.5) that picks up coal from the chest at position(x=43.5, y=-81.5) and drops it into the chest at position(x=43.5, y=-79.5).\n\n### Coal storage at position(x=42.5, y=-83.5)\nConsists of a chest at position(x=42.5, y=-83.5) with 73 coal, a chest at position(x=44.5, y=-81.5) with 30 coal, and a chest at position(x=43.5, y=-79.5) with 800 coal.\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n### Errors when extracting coal from a full chest\n- Ensure the chest is not full before attempting to extract coal.\n- Empty the chest before extracting coal to avoid errors.\n\n### Errors when the drill is out of fuel\n- Refuel the drill regularly to avoid it running out of fuel.\n- Monitor the drill's fuel level to prevent it from stopping due to lack of fuel.\n\n### Errors when the inserter is waiting for source items\n- Ensure the inserter has source items to pick up before attempting to drop items.\n- Monitor the inserter's source and destination chests to prevent errors due to lack of items.\n\n### Errors when the chest is full at the drop position\n- Empty the chest at the drop position before attempting to drop items.\n- Monitor the chest's inventory level to prevent errors due to a full chest."}
