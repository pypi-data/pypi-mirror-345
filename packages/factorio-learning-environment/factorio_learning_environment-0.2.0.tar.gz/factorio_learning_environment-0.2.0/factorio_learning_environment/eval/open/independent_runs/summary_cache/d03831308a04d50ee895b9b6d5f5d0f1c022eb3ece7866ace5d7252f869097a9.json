This furnace is currently full.\n\n### Chest at position(-14.5, -52.5)\nContains 37 iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when extracting/inserting items to/from inventory\n- The agent is failing to transfer items between its inventory and a chest due to an issue with variable scope. The error message \"cannot access local variable 'x' where it is not associated with a value\" suggests that the code attempting the transfer is referencing a variable 'x' that has not been properly defined or assigned within the current scope. Ensure that all variables used in the extraction/insertion logic are correctly defined and accessible within the function or block of code responsible for the transfer.\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- The agent is failing to place entities, specifically furnaces and chests, due to unmet placement conditions. The error message \"Placement conditions not met\" indicates that the target tile is either occupied, out of reach, or otherwise unsuitable for the entity being placed. Before attempting to place an entity, ensure that the target tile is empty, within the agent's reach, and satisfies any other placement requirements specific to the entity.\n\n### Errors when crafting\n- The agent is failing to craft automation science packs due to a missing ingredient: copper plate. The error message indicates that copper plate cannot be crafted because it requires smelting in a furnace, which the agent has not yet automated. To resolve this, the agent needs to set up a copper smelting operation, ensuring that copper ore is automatically fed into a furnace and the resulting copper plates are collected.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Variables\n- Inventory contents: `dict[str, int]`\n  - Contains the current items and their counts in the agent's inventory. Example: `{'wooden-chest': 18, 'transport-belt': 6, 'wood': 98, 'coal': 589, 'iron-ore': 1800, 'copper-ore': 1169, 'iron-plate': 453}`\n- Chest contents: `dict[str, int]`\n  - Contains the current items and their counts in the chest at (-14.5, -52.5). Example: `{'iron-plate': 37}`\n```"}
