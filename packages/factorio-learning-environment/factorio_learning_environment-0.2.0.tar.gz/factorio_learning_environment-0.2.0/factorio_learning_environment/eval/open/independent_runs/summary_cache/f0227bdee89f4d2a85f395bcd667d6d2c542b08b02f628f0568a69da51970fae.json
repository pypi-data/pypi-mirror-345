{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production at (x=1-3, y=1)\nConsists of:\n- Two stone furnaces at (1.0, 1.0) and (3.0, 1.0)\n- Two burner inserters at (1.5, 2.5) and (3.5, 2.5)\n- Two output wooden chests at (1.5, 3.5) and (3.5, 3.5) containing iron plates\n- Additional wooden chest at (5.5, 3.5) with burner inserter at (5.5, 2.5)\n\n### Copper Plate Production at (x=2-4, y=7)\nConsists of:\n- Two stone furnaces at (2.0, 7.0) and (4.0, 7.0)\n- Two burner inserters at (2.5, 8.5) and (4.5, 8.5)\n- Output wooden chests at (2.5, 9.5) and (4.5, 9.5)\n- Connecting burner inserter at (3.5, 9.5)\n- Transport belt system connecting furnaces\n\n### Copper Cable Production Line at (x=14.5, y=14.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine at (14.5, 14.5)\n- Input chest at (14.5, 11.5)\n- Burner inserter at (14.5, 12.5)\n- Output chest at (11.5, 14.5) containing copper cables\n- Burner inserter at (12.5, 14.5)\n- Additional chest at (17.5, 14.5) with burner inserter at (16.5, 14.5)\n\n### Electronic Circuit Production Line at (x=21.5, y=15.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine at (21.5, 15.5)\n- Input chest at (21.5, 11.5) containing iron plates\n- Intermediate chest at (21.5, 12.5)\n- Burner inserter at (21.5, 13.5)\n\n### Power Generation System\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at (2.5, 35.5)\n- Boiler at (7.0, 35.5)\n- Steam engine at (13.5, 35.5)\n- Connected pipe network for water and steam\n- Electricity network connecting various entities\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Errors\n- Check if target location is clear before placing entities\n- Cannot place entities where other entities already exist (e.g., wooden chest placement failed at 14.5, 13.5)\n\n### Resource Management Issues\n- Both assembling machines are experiencing ingredient shortages\n- Ensure proper supply chain of materials to assembling machines\n- Make sure inserters are properly fueled with coal to maintain operation\n\n### Connection Issues\n- One offshore pump (at -5.5, 26.5) is not connected to the fluid system\n- Ensure all fluid-carrying entities are properly connected in sequence\n\n### Production Line Efficiency\n- Multiple inserters are waiting for source items\n- Some chests are reported as full, blocking further item transfer\n- Consider balancing production and transfer rates between different stages"}
