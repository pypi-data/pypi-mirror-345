{"content": "I notice the issue now - the get_entities() call for furnaces is returning an empty list. Let's debug this and try a different approach:\n\n```python\n# First, let's check what entities we actually have\nall_entities = get_entities()\nprint(\"All entities on map:\", [f\"{e.name} at {e.position}\" for e in all_entities])\n\n# Get the wooden chest with iron ore\nchest = get_entities({Prototype.WoodenChest})[0]\nprint(f\"Found wooden chest at {chest.position} with contents: {inspect_inventory(chest)}\")\n\n# Let's try to place a new furnace near the chest if we can't find one\ntry:\n    new_furnace = place_entity_next_to(\n        Prototype.StoneFurnace,\n        reference_position=chest.position,\n        direction=Direction.RIGHT,\n        spacing=1\n    )\n    print(f\"Placed new furnace at {new_furnace.position}\")\n    \n    # Add fuel to new furnace\n    move_to(new_furnace.position)\n    insert_item(Prototype.Coal, new_furnace, quantity=5)\n    print(\"Added fuel to furnace\")\n    \n    # Get ore from chest\n    move_to(chest.position)\n    iron_ore = extract_item(Prototype.IronOre, chest.position, quantity=10)\n    print(f\"Extracted ore.

First check what entities actually exist on the map\n2. Try to place a new furnace if needed\n3. Fall back to using an existing furnace if we can't place a new one\n4. Handle the smelting process either way\n\nLet me know if you see any issues with this approach.", "summary_range": "[1-3648]"}
