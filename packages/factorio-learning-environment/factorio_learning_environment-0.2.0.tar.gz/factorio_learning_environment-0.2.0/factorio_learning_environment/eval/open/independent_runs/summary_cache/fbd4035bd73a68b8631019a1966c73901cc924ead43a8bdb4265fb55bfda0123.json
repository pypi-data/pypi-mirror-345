{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-18.5, 19.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position -18.5, 19.5), boiler (position -13.5, 20.0), and offshore pump (position -11.5, 26.5). The steam engine is intended to generate electricity but is currently not receiving power due to connection issues. The boiler is responsible for converting water into steam but is out of fuel. The offshore pump is used to extract water from a nearby source.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(-18.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position -18.0, -49.0) and a furnace at position (-18.0, -49.0).\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position -18.0, -49.0) and a furnace at position (-18.0, -49.0).\n- Assembling machine at position (z1) and inserter at position (a) that puts into assembling machine.\n- Beltgroup (position) that connects the furnace at position (-18.0, -49.0) to the assembling machine at position (z1).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to electricity generation\n- Ensure that the steam engine is properly connected to a power network. Check the connections to electric poles and ensure they are functional.\n- Verify that the boiler has fuel to operate. If it is out of fuel, it will not produce steam for the steam engine.\n- Confirm that the offshore pump is operational and connected to the water source to supply the boiler.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing. Check for existing entities in the intended position."}
