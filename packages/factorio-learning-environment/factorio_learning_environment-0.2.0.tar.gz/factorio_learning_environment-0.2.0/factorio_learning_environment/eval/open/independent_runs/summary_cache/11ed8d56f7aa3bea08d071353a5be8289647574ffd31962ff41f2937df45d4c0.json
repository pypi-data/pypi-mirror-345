{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnace at position (61.0, -54.0)**\n  - Fuel: Coal (12 units)\n  - Source: Iron ore (14 units)\n  - Result: Iron plate (32 units)\n- **Furnace at position (64.0, -53.0)**\n  - Fuel: Coal (20 units)\n  - Source: Iron ore (14 units)\n  - Result: Iron plate (32 units)\n- **Burner Inserter at position (62.5, -53.5)**\n  - Fuel: Coal (4 units)\n  - Status: Waiting for source items\n  - Connects chest at (61.5, -52.5) to furnace at (61.0, -54.0)\n- **Burner Inserter at position (65.5, -52.5)**\n  - Fuel: Coal (4 units)\n  - Status: Waiting for source items\n  - Connects to furnace at (64.0, -53.0)\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0)**\n  - Fuel: Coal (5 units)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Drops coal into wooden chest at (40.5, -83.5)\n- **Wooden Chests for Coal Storage**\n  - Chest at position (40.5, -83.5) with 617 units of coal\n  - Chest at position (42.5, -83.5) with 505 units of coal\n  - Chest at position (43.5, -83.5) with 450 units of coal\n  - Chest at position (44.5, -83.5) with 411 units of coal\n- **Burner Inserter at position (41.5, -83.5)**\n  - Fuel: Coal (5 units)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Transfers coal between chests and mining drill\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Connecting Transport Belts\n- Ensure that the path for connecting transport belts is valid and can be normalized. Verify that the start and end positions are correctly specified and that there are no obstructions or invalid paths between them.\n\n### Errors in Inserting Items\n- Before attempting to insert items, ensure that the required items are available in the inventory. Check the inventory for the necessary items before executing the insert operation.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- **connect_entities(belt_start_position, belt_path_to_inserter_1.center, Prototype.TransportBelt)**\n  - Failure Mode: Path normalization failed due to invalid path specifications.\n  - Success Mode: Successfully connects transport belts if the path is valid and unobstructed.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `belt_to_inserter_1`: Represents the connection between a transport belt and an inserter.\n- `furnace_1`: Represents a furnace entity for item insertion operations."}
