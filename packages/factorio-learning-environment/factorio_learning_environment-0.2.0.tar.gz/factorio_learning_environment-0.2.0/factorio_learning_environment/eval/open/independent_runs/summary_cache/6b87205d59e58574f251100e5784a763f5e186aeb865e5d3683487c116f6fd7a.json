{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining Station at (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (41.0, -82.0)\n- Wooden chest (41.5, -80.5) for coal storage\n- Burner inserter (41.5, -79.5) moving items from mining drill to chest\n\n### Iron Production Line at (-18.0, -53.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (-18.0, -53.0) for iron ore\n- Wooden chest (-17.5, -51.5) for temporary iron ore storage\n- Burner inserter (-16.5, -51.5) moving ore from chest to furnace\n- Stone furnace (-15.0, -51.0) smelting iron ore\n- Burner inserter (-13.5, -50.5) moving plates to storage\n- Wooden chest (-12.5, -50.5) for iron plate storage\n\n### Copper Production Line at (-28.0, -61.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (-28.0, -61.0) for copper ore\n- Wooden chest (-27.5, -59.5) for copper ore storage\n- Burner inserter (-26.5, -59.5) moving ore to furnace\n- Stone furnace (-25.0, -59.0) smelting copper ore\n- Burner inserter (-23.5, -58.5) moving plates to storage\n- Wooden chest (-22.5, -58.5) for copper plate storage\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Resource Management\n- Ensure required items are in inventory before attempting to place structures\n- When setting up new production lines, craft necessary buildings first (burner mining drills, etc.)\n- Wood is a raw resource that must be harvested, not crafted\n\n### Production Chain Dependencies\n- When setting up electronic circuit production:\n  - Need assembling machines for automated crafting\n  - Need copper cable production first\n  - Need copper plates as input material\n\n### Recipe Requirements\n- Some items cannot be hand-crafted and require specific buildings:\n  - Copper plates require smelting in furnaces\n  - Electronic circuits require assembling machines\n  - Labs require electronic circuits as prerequisites\n\n### Storage Management\n- Monitor chest capacities to prevent overflow conditions\n- Empty storage chests regularly when \"chest is full\" warnings appear\n- Implement overflow protection mechanisms for critical storage points\n\n### Fuel Management\n- Keep all burner devices (mining drills, inserters) adequately fueled\n- Monitor fuel levels regularly to maintain continuous operation\n- Ensure coal production and distribution keeps up with fuel consumption\n\n### Entity Placement\n- Verify target location is clear before placing new entities\n- Ensure proper spacing between entities to allow for inserter operation\n- Consider future expansion when placing initial structures\n\n### Inserter Blockage\n- When inserters show \"waiting for space in destination\" warnings, ensure there is adequate space in target inventory\n- Place appropriate sink objects at drop positions to prevent blockage"}
