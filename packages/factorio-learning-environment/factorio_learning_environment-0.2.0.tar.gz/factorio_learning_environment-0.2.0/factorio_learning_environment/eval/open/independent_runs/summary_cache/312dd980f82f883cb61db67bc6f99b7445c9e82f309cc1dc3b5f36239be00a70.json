{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at Position (-23.0, -68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) and a Wooden Chest at position (-23.5, -69.5)\n- Transport Belt network connecting the mining drill to the chest\n\n### Iron Plate Mine at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) and a Wooden Chest at position (-12.5, -54.5)\n- Transport Belt network connecting the mining drill to the chest\n\n### Iron Plate Smelting Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -70.0) and position (-18.0, -70.0)\n- Transport Belt network connecting the furnaces to a Wooden Chest at position (-16.5, -64.5)\n- Burner Inserters at position (-20.5, -66.5) and position (-17.5, -64.5) moving items between belts and furnaces\n\n### Iron Plate Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (-16.5, -64.5) storing iron plates\n\n### Miscellaneous Storage\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chests at various positions storing different resources such as coal, iron ore, and copper ore\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using Belt Connections\n- Ensure that the entities being connected by belts have compatible attributes and outputs. The 'Chest' object does not have an 'outputs' attribute, so it cannot be directly connected as a belt output.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Verify that the source items are available and accessible to the inserter. The inserter at position (-20.5, -66.5) is waiting for source items, indicating a possible issue with the supply chain or item availability.\n\n### Errors with Fuel Management\n- Ensure that all fuel-dependent entities, such as burner mining drills and furnaces, have sufficient fuel to operate. Several entities report being out of fuel, which can halt production processes.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Ingredients\n- Confirm that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Multiple furnaces report having no ingredients to smelt, which can interrupt the production of plates."}
