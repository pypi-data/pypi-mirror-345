{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Transport System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (40.0, -84.0) with a transport belt network directing output to a burner inserter.\n- Transport Belts connecting positions (41.5, -85.5) to (41.5, -82.5) facilitating coal movement.\n- Burner Inserter at position (40.5, -82.5) transferring coal to a wooden chest at position (40.5, -81.5).\n\n### Coal Storage System\nConsists of:\n- Wooden Chest at position (40.5, -81.5) for storing coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (41.5, -80.5) transferring items into the chest.\n\n### Iron Plate Production\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -49.0) for smelting, currently with no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Transport Belt Network\nConsists of multiple belt groups facilitating movement of resources across various locations:\n- BeltGroup from (50.5, -86.5) to (48.5, -86.5) with coal inventory.\n- BeltGroup from (54.5, -86.5) to (52.5, -82.5) currently empty.\n- BeltGroup from (41.5, -85.5) to (41.5, -80.5) currently empty.\n- Additional belt groups facilitating movement between various positions, currently empty.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Output Blockage\n- Ensure there is a sink entity to accept output from drills or inserters to prevent blockage.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Placement\n- Verify the direction and position of inserters to ensure they are correctly aligned with target chests or belts.\n\n### Errors with Full Inventory\n- Regularly check and clear out full chests to avoid stoppage in production lines.\n\n### Errors with No Ingredients in Furnace\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt to maintain production efficiency."}
