{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-4.5, 23.0)\nConsists of boiler (position -4.5, 23.0) and offshore pump (position -7.5, 25.5).\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace (position 0.0, 0.0) with coal as fuel.\n- Furnace (position 5.0, 5.0) with coal as fuel.\n\n### Steam engine at position(-0.5, -9.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam engine (position -0.5, -9.5) which is currently not connected to a power network.\n\n### Pipe network\nConsists of the following pipe groups:\n- PipeGroup (fluid system=15831, position -4.5, 20.5) with working status.\n- PipeGroup (fluid system=15816, position -8.5, -7.5) with empty status.\n- PipeGroup (fluid system=15834, position -14.5, 23.5) with empty status.\n- PipeGroup (fluid system=15837, position -18.5, 25.5) with empty status.\n- PipeGroup (fluid system=15842, position -20.5, 29.5) with empty status.\n- PipeGroup (fluid system=15841, position -21.5, 28.5) with empty status.\n\n### Electricity network\nConsists of the following electricity groups:\n- ElectricityGroup (id=71311) with poles at various positions, including (-8.5, 23.5), (-11.5, 26.5), and (-4.5, 21.5).\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing pipes at occupied positions\n- Ensure you can place a pipe at a position before attempting to place it. If an entity already exists at the target position, remove it before continuing.\n\n### Errors when connecting steam engine\n- Verify that the steam engine is connected to a power network and has the necessary input liquid to function. Check the pipe connections to ensure they are correctly established.\n\n### Errors related to fuel and ingredients\n- Ensure that the boiler has fuel to operate. If it shows \"out of fuel,\" add the necessary fuel to keep it running.\n- For furnaces, ensure there are ingredients available to smelt. If it shows \"no ingredients to smelt,\" provide the required materials."}
