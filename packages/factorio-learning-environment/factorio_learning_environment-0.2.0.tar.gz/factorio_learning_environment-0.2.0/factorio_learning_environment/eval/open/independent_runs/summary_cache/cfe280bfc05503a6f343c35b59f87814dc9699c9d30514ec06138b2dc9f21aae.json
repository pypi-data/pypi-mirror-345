{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (46.0, -82.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace at position (46.0, -82.0) that processes iron ore into iron plates and now has been used for copper smelting.\n- Wooden chest at position (47.5, -81.5) that collects the processed outputs.\nUpdates:\n- Steps 38\u201347 to 62: Managed and processed iron ore into iron plates with periodic inventory updates and timeout errors due to resource shortages or delayed processing.\n- Steps 64\u201365: Although a new Stone Furnace for copper smelting was attempted at the copper ore patch (x=-28.5, y=-61.5) but failed due to lack of inventory, the agent used the existing Stone Furnace at (46.0, -82.0) for copper ore insertion. An error in entity reference occurred during the insertion step for copper smelting.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Entity Placement and Inventory Checks\n- Verify the availability of required items in inventory before attempting to place entities. The error \u201cNo stone_furnace in inventory\u201d indicates a missing item check before placement.\n\n### Errors in API Argument Types\n- Ensure that API functions receive the correct argument types. Specifically, when inserting items, pass a valid Entity or EntityGroup rather than a Position, as indicated in the copper ore insertion error.\n\n### Timeout and Waiting Cycle Management in Smelting (Previous)\n- Consistently ensure fuel and ingredient availability and monitor processing progress closely to minimize smelting delays.\n\n### Insufficient Resource Verification (Previous)\n- Confirm adequate resource quantities prior to insertion operations to prevent interruption of production cycles.\n\n### Stale Entity Data Utilization (Previous)\n- Keep entity data updated after inventory changes to avoid decisions based on outdated spatial or inventory information."}
