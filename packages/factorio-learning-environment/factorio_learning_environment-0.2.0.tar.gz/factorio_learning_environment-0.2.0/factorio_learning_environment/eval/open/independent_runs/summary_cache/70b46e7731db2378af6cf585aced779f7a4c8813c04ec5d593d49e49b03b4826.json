{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-13.5, 20.0)\nConsists of boiler (position -13.5, 20.0) and steam engine (position -18.5, 19.5). The boiler is currently working and has coal as fuel, while the steam engine is not connected to the power network.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(-18.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position -18.0, -49.0) and a furnace (position -18.0, -49.0)\n\n### Iron plate mine at position(5.0, -73.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 5.0, -73.0) and a furnace (position 5.0, -73.0)\n\n### Offshore pump at position(-11.5, 26.5)\nConsists of offshore pump (position -11.5, 26.5) which is currently working and connected to a fluid system.\n\n### Lab at position(-17.5, 23.5)\nConsists of lab (position -17.5, 23.5) which is currently not receiving power.\n\n### Assembling machine at position(-21.5, 25.5)\nConsists of assembling machine (position -21.5, 25.5) which is currently not receiving electricity and cannot create automation-science-pack due to missing resources.\n\n### Pipe groups\nConsists of multiple pipe groups connecting various fluid systems, including:\n- PipeGroup at position(-14.5, 16.5) with status EMPTY\n- PipeGroup at position(-13.5, 17.5) with fluid steam and status FULL_OUTPUT\n- PipeGroup at position(-12.5, 21.5) with fluid water and status WORKING\n- Additional pipe groups with status EMPTY at various positions.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting pipes\n- Ensure that the positions of the entities you are trying to connect are adjacent and that there is no obstruction between them. Check the coordinates carefully before attempting to connect.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing. Verify that the target tile is free from other entities.\n\n### Errors when not receiving power\n- Check the connections to the power network for all entities that require electricity. Ensure that there are no breaks in the connections and that the power source is operational.\n\n### Errors when entities are not connected\n- Verify the connections between the boiler and steam engine. Ensure that the necessary pipes are placed correctly to allow for fluid transfer.\n\n### Errors with missing resources\n- For the assembling machine, ensure that all required resources are available in the inventory to avoid errors related to crafting. Check the recipe requirements before attempting to craft items."}
