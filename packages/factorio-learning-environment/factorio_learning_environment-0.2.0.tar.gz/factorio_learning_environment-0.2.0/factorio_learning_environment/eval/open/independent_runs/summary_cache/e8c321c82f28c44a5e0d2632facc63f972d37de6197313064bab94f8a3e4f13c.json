{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Electricity Generator at (x=-3.0, y=2.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump (x=-9.5, y=-0.5) [working, connected to water pipe]\n- Boiler (x=-3.0, y=2.5) [NO_FUEL warning, steam output at x=-1.5,y=2.5]\n- Steam engine (x=0.5, y=2.5) [NOT_CONNECTED, no input liquid]\nConnected by PipeGroup 5773 (water system)\n\n#### Secondary Boiler System at (x=11.0, y=10.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump (x=-9.5, y=14.5) [NOT_CONNECTED]\n- Boiler (x=11.0, y=10.5) [NO_FUEL, NOT_CONNECTED]\n- Pipe-to-ground connection at (x=9.5, y=11.5)\n\n#### Oil Processing Facility\n1. Crude Oil Extraction:\n   - Pumpjack (x=17.5, y=40.5) [NO_POWER, crude oil deposit]\n   - Storage tank (x=4.5, y=15.5) [working, multiple pipe connections]\n\n2. Oil Refinery:\n   - Oil refinery (x=9.5, y=15.5) [NO_POWER, crude oil input at x=6.5,y=16.5]\n   - Petroleum gas output pipe (x=12.5, y=17.5) [empty PipeGroup 5789]\n\n3. Chemical Processing:\n   - Chemical plant (x=2.5, y=8.5) [NO_POWER, water input connected]\n   - Sulfur output tank (x=6.5, y=8.5) [empty]\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Persistent Placement Errors\n1. Boiler placement failures at (-3.0, -0.5), (-3.0, 0.5), (0.0, 0.0)\n   - Verify tile is land and not water before placement\n   - Scan for existing entities in target area\n   - Maintain minimum 1-tile clearance around boilers\n\n#### Distance Management Issues\n1. Offshore pump placement at (40.5, 40.5) too far (57.28 tiles)\n   - Move within 10-tile range before placement\n   - Implement distance checks before placement attempts\n\n#### Inventory Management\n1. Offshore pump placement failed due to empty inventory\n   - Verify item availability before placement operations\n   - Track inventory levels proactively\n\n#### Connection Problems\n1. Underground pipe connection failure (-9.5,14.5 to 11.0,10.5)\n   - Ensure matching pipe directions\n   - Verify clear path between connection points\n   - Test connections in smaller segments\n\n#### Power System Issues\n1. Multiple NO_POWER states (pumpjack, refinery, chemical plant)\n   - Verify power pole coverage (electricity group 9792)\n   - Check steam engine connectivity (still NOT_CONNECTED)\n\n#### General Construction Tips\n1. Implement pre-placement validation checks:\n   - Terrain type\n   - Entity collisions\n   - Inventory availability\n   - Distance requirements\n2. Use debug tools to inspect entity states\n3. Build connections incrementally with validation"}
