{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position 0.0, 0.0)\n\n### Coal Supply System at position (42.5, -81.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest (position 42.5, -81.5) containing coal\n- Burner inserter (position 42.5, -80.5) that extracts coal from the wooden chest\n- Burner inserter (position 43.5, -81.5) that places coal into the burner mining drill\n- Burner mining drill (position 42.0, -83.0) that is currently out of fuel\n\n### Iron Plate Mine at position (-15, -50)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position -15.0, -50.0) that is currently out of fuel\n- Wooden chest (position -14.5, -48.5) that is empty\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n- **Errors related to coal extraction:**\n  - Ensure there is coal available in the wooden chest before attempting to extract it. The wooden chest has been running low on coal, resulting in repeated \"No Coal available\" messages.\n  \n- **Errors with burner mining drill:**\n  - The burner mining drill at position (42.0, -83.0) is out of fuel. Ensure that the inserters are properly supplying fuel to the burner mining drill to maintain its operation.\n\n- **Errors with inserter waiting states:**\n  - The inserters are frequently in a \"WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS\" or \"WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION\" state. Check the connections and ensure that there is a continuous supply of items to and from the inserters.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - None defined yet.\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `coal`: int (available coal in wooden chest)\n  - `iron-plate`: int (inventory in stone furnace)\n  - `burner-mining-drill`: Entity (status and position of the mining drill)\n  - `burner-inserter`: Entity (status and position of the inserters)\n  - `wooden-chest`: Entity (status and position of the wooden chest)"}
