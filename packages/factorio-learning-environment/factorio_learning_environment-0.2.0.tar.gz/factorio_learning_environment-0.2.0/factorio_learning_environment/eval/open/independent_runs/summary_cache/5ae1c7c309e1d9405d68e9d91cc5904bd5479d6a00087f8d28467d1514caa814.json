{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (4.0, -60.0) with a drop position at (4.5, -58.5). It is currently working but has a warning that the chest at the drop position is full.\n- Multiple Stone Furnaces at positions (-15.0, -48.0), (-13.0, -48.0), and (-11.0, -48.0). All are working with varying amounts of coal and iron ore in their inventories, producing iron plates.\n\n### Storage Area\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chests at positions (5.5, -60.5), (7.5, -60.5), (6.5, -60.5), (9.5, -60.5), (8.5, -60.5), and (4.5, -58.5). These chests are used for storing extracted resources.\n- Additional Wooden Chests at positions (-14.5, -50.5), (-13.5, -50.5), (-12.5, -50.5), (-11.5, -50.5), (-10.5, -50.5), (-9.5, -50.5), (-8.5, -50.5), (-7.5, -50.5), and (-6.5, -50.5). Some of these chests are full with iron plates.\n- Iron Chests at positions (-6.5, -50.5) and (-5.5, -50.5) for additional storage, with one containing iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Insufficient Fuel for Burner Mining Drill\n- Ensure that there is enough coal in the inventory to refuel the burner mining drill. Regularly check and replenish coal supplies to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Full Chest Warnings\n- Monitor the storage chests regularly to prevent them from becoming full. Consider upgrading to larger chests or redistributing resources to avoid halting production.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `iron_ore`: int, represents the quantity of iron ore in the inventory.\n- `iron_plate`: int, represents the quantity of iron plates in the inventory.\n- `coal`: int, represents the quantity of coal available for fueling furnaces and drills."}
