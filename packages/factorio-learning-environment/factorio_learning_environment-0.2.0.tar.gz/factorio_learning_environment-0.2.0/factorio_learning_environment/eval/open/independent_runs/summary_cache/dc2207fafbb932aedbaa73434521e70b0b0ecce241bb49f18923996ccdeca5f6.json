{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) refueled with coal, extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (x=-15.5, y=-48.5) and (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) used for storing extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserters** at positions (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) and (x=-14.5, y=-47.5) transferring iron ore from chests to furnaces.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (x=-12.0, y=-48.0) and (x=-10.0, y=-48.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-46.5) storing iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-8.5, y=-47.5) transferring iron plates from the furnace to a chest.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (x=-6.5, y=-48.5) and (x=-7.5, y=-47.5) storing iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### UnboundLocalError: Cannot Access Local Variable\n- Ensure that all local variables are initialized before being accessed. This error often occurs when a variable is used before it has been assigned a value.\n\n### ValueError: Invalid Argument Type\n- When using functions that require specific argument types, ensure that the correct type is passed. For instance, when a function expects an Entity or Position object, do not pass an integer or any other type.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source of the inserter has available items to transfer. This can be resolved by checking the inventory of the source entity to ensure it is not empty.\n\n### No Items Available for Transfer\n- Before attempting to transfer items, verify that the source inventory contains the items you wish to move. This will prevent errors related to attempting to transfer non-existent items.\n\n### Furnace Output Full\n- Regularly monitor and clear the output of furnaces to prevent them from becoming full, which halts production. Consider using inserters to automatically transfer items from the furnace output to a storage chest.\n\n### No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Ensure that furnaces have a continuous supply of raw materials to process. This can be achieved by maintaining a steady flow of resources from mining drills to furnaces.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Space in Destination\n- Make sure that the destination of the inserter has enough space to accommodate incoming items. This can be managed by regularly clearing or expanding storage capacity."}
