{"content": "Based on my interaction with the Factorio API, here's my analysis:\n\nSuccessful Patterns:\n1. Moving to locations before interacting with them\n2. Checking inventory contents before operations\n3. Sequential operations: move -> place -> insert -> wait -> extract\n\nErrors Encountered:\n1. Initially tried to place furnace without being in range (>10 units away)\n2. Needed to ensure we're at the correct position before placing entities\n\nKey Learnings:\n1. Must be within 10 units of target location to place entities\n2. Need to move to position first before any interaction\n3. Furnace operations require proper sequencing (fuel first, then materials)\n\nSuccessful Implementation Pattern:\n```python\n# Find resource\nresource_pos = nearest(Resource.Type)\nmove_to(resource_pos)\n\n# Place building near resource\nbuilding_pos = Position(x=resource_pos.x + 2, y=resource_pos.y)\nmove_to(building_pos)\nbuilding = place_entity(Prototype.Building, position=building_pos)\n\n# Gather resources\nmove_to(resource_pos)\nharvest_resource(resource_pos, quantity=N)\n\n# Insert items into building\ninsert_item(Prototype.Fuel, building, quantity=N)\ninsert_item(Prototype.Resource, building, quantity=N)\n\n# Wait and collect results\nsleep(5)\nextract_item(Prototype.Result, building.position, quantity=N)\n```\n\nTips for Future:\n1. Always check current position before placing entities\n2. Keep track of entity positions for future interactions\n3. Verify inventory contents before attempting insertions\n4. Use proper sequencing: move -> place -> fuel -> resource -> wait -> extract\n5. Consider distance limitations when planning building placement\n\nAreas for Improvement:\n1. Could add error handling for insufficient resources\n2. Could add position verification before operations\n3. Could implement retry logic for failed placements\n4. Could add inventory checking before operations\n\nThe API requires careful attention to positioning and sequencing, but works reliably when these requirements are met.", "summary_range": "[1-2240]"}
