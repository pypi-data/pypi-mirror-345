{"content": "# Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-4.5, 23.0)\nConsists of boiler (position -4.5, 23.0) and offshore pump (position -7.5, 25.5). The boiler is currently out of fuel and requires water from the offshore pump to operate.\n\n### Pipe network\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Pipe connecting offshore pump (position -7.5, 25.5) to boiler (position -4.5, 23.0).\n- Additional pipes forming a network that connects various entities, including the boiler and offshore pump.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(x)\nConsists of following entities\n- Burner mining drill (position x1) and a furnace at position(y1)\n- Burner mining drill (position x2) and a furnace at position(y2)\n- Burner mining drill (position x3) and a furnace at position(y3)\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of following entities\n- Burner mining drill (position x1) and a furnace at position(y1)\n- Assembling machine at position(z1) and inserter at position(a) that puts into assembling machine\n- Beltgroup (position) that connects the furnace at position y1 to assembling machine at position(z1)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting entities\n- Ensure that the entities you are trying to connect are within a valid distance. The connection attempt from the boiler at position (-4.5, 23.0) to the steam engine at position (-0.5, -9.5) failed due to being too far apart.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors related to fuel and power\n- Check that all entities requiring fuel or power are adequately supplied. The boiler is currently out of fuel and the steam engine is not connected to a power network."}
