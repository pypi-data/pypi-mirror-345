{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) fueled with coal, currently working. It is responsible for extracting iron ore. The drill is connected to:\n  - **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-15.5, y=-48.5) and another at (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) for storing extracted iron ore.\n  - **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) which moves iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0) fueled with coal, currently working. It processes iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5) which is responsible for moving items within the setup, currently waiting for source items.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Insufficient Inventory for Refueling\n- Ensure you have enough coal in your inventory before attempting to refuel entities like furnaces or inserters. This will prevent errors related to insufficient resources.\n\n### Full Chest Warning\n- Regularly check and empty chests to avoid interruptions in mining operations. A full chest will halt the mining drill, impacting overall production efficiency.\n\n### Errors When Inserting Items\n- Verify that you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. This will prevent errors related to missing items during insertion operations."}
