{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report (Steps 32-39)\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at position (-18.5, 69.5)\n(Now showing power issues)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump (position x=-18.5 y=69.5) - working\n- Boiler (position x=-4.5 y=50.0) - out of fuel\n- Steam engine (position x=0.5 y=50.5) - not connected to power network\n- Connected with pipe groups:\n  - Water pipes from pump to boiler (positions: x=-18.5,y=68.5; x=-18.5,y=67.5; x=-6.5,y=50.5; x=-6.5,y=51.5)\n  - Steam pipes from boiler to engine (positions: x=-4.5,y=48.5; x=-3.5,y=48.5; x=0.5,y=47.5)\n- Power pole network (positions: x=0.5,y=53.5; x=30.5,y=52.5) - voltage 0\n\n### Stone Mining and Smelting Operation at position (-49.5, 10.5)\n(Unchanged from previous report)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill (position x=-49.5 y=10.5)\n- Stone furnace (position x=-46.0 y=11.0)\n- Input inserter (position x=-47.5 y=10.5)\n- Output chest (position x=-44.5 y=11.5)\n- Power pole (position x=-46.5 y=12.5)\n\n### New Stone Mining Operation at position (-46.5, -0.5)\n(Now rebuilt but with power issues)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill (position x=-46.5 y=-0.5) - no power\n- Stone furnace (position x=-43.0 y=0.0) - no ingredients\n- Input inserter (position x=-44.5 y=-0.5) - no power\n- Power pole (position x=-46.5 y=1.5) - connected to main grid\n- Missing output chest (was at x=-41.5 y=0.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity retrieval failures (recurring)\n- Multiple failed attempts to get inserters, drills, poles and chests (steps 32, 36, 37, 38, 39)\n  - Verify entity existence before retrieval attempts\n  - Check for entity destruction or replacement\n  - Maintain references to placed entities when possible\n\n### Power system failures (new critical issue)\n- Entire power grid down (step 39)\n  - Boiler out of fuel (x=-4.5 y=50.0)\n  - Steam engine not connected (x=0.5 y=50.5)\n  - Mining operations without power\n  - Immediate actions needed:\n    1. Add coal to boiler\n    2. Verify all power connections\n    3. Check pole network connectivity\n\n### Entity placement distance (recurring)\n- Still attempting placements from too far (step 34)\n  - Move within 10 tiles before placing\n  - Use teleport if needed for distant builds\n  - Verify player position before placement\n\n### Type handling errors (recurring)\n- String attribute access attempts (steps 33, 35)\n  - Verify return types from API calls\n  - Implement proper type checking\n  - Handle API responses appropriately\n\n### Production chain issues (new)\n- Multiple points of failure in stone production (step 39)\n  - Drill: No power\n  - Inserter: No power\n  - Furnace: No ingredients despite coal\n  - Missing output chest\n  - Solution approach:\n    1. Fix power system first\n    2. Verify all connections\n    3. Rebuild missing chest\n    4. Check inserter alignment\n\n### Entity reference management (recurring)\n- Lost references after rebuilds (steps 36-39)\n  - Maintain entity references through rebuilds\n  - Implement tracking system for placed entities\n  - Verify positions match expected locations\n\n### System verification gaps (new)\n- Missing validation steps (throughout)\n  - Add verification after each placement\n  - Check power status of new entities\n  - Validate production chain connectivity"}
