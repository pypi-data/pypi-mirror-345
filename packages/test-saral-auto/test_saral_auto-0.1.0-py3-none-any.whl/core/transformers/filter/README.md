# Filter Module

This module provides various image filtering techniques for noise reduction and edge detection.

## Features
- Gaussian filtering for noise reduction
- Edge detection using Canny and Sobel operators
- Image smoothing and sharpening

## Components
- `filter_noise.py`: Implements Gaussian filtering
- `filter_edges.py`: Implements Canny and Sobel edge detection

## Usage
The filter module is used for image preprocessing, noise reduction, and edge detection in document analysis pipelines.
