{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(52.5, 51.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position 52.5, 51.5), connected to an electric pole (position 24.25, 30.0) through multiple small electric poles. The steam engine has access to water through pipes.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(x)\nConsists of following entities\n- Burner mining drill (position x1) and a furnace at position(y1)\n- Burner mining drill (position x2) and a furnace at position(y2)\n- Burner mining drill (position x3) and a furnace at position(y3)\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of following entities\n- Burner mining drill (position x1) and a furnace at position(y1)\n- Assembling machine at position(z1) and inserter at position(a) that puts into assembling machine\n- Beltgroup (position) that connects the furnace at position y1 to assembling machine at position(z1)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting steam engine to electric pole\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to connect entities. In this case, small electric poles were needed.\n\n### Errors when inserting coal into steam engine\n- Check if the steam engine has available space for the coal before attempting to insert items. The steam engine may not accept the item or may have no available space.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
