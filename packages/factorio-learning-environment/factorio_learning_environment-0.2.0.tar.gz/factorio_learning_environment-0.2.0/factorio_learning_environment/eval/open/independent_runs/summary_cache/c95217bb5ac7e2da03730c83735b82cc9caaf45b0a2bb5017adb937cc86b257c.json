{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab (position(3.0, 0.0)) - currently not powered\n- Small electric poles (positions(0.5, 1.5) and (2.5, 2.5)) - used to connect power to nearby structures\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace (position(0.0, 0.0)) - currently has fuel but no ingredients to smelt\n- Furnace (position(2.0, 0.0)) - currently has fuel but no ingredients to smelt\n- Chest (position(3.5, 0.5)) - currently empty\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing new electric poles\n- Ensure that the first argument when placing a new pole is a valid Prototype object. Check the API documentation for correct usage.\n\n### Errors related to lab power\n- Ensure that the lab is connected to a power source. Check the connections to the electric poles to ensure they are functional.\n\n### Errors when lacking required ingredients for research\n- Gather the necessary ingredients (in this case, 10 automation science packs) before attempting to complete research. Check inventory and production lines to ensure sufficient resources are available.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it. Check for existing entities in the target position."}
