{"content": "# FACTORIO AGENT REPORT\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Smelting Setup 1 (at y=0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace at (0.0, 0.0)\n- Stone furnace at (2.0, 0.0)\n- Burner inserter at (0.5, 1.5) connected to first furnace\n- Burner inserter at (2.5, 1.5) connected to second furnace\n\n### Iron Smelting Setup 2 (at y=4)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace at (4.0, 4.0)\n- Stone furnace at (6.0, 4.0)\n- Burner inserter at (4.5, 5.5) connected to first furnace\n- Burner inserter at (6.5, 5.5) connected to second furnace\n\nBoth smelting setups are actively processing iron ore into iron plates. All furnaces are fueled with coal and inserters are powered by coal.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Errors\n- Ensure required items are in inventory before attempting to place entities\n- When placing entities next to existing ones, account for the tile dimensions of both entities to avoid overlap\n- Consider using appropriate spacing parameters when placing entities next to each other\n\n### Resource/Item Related Errors\n- Verify inventory has required raw materials before attempting crafting operations\n- Some items like wood must be gathered as raw resources and cannot be crafted\n- Ensure sufficient quantities of materials are available before attempting large crafting operations\n\n### Inserter Setup Issues\n- Inserters currently have no output destination, resulting in blocked operations\n- Place appropriate destination containers (like chests) at inserter drop positions\n- Current drop positions: (0.5, 2.5), (2.5, 2.5), (4.5, 6.5), and (6.5, 6.5)\n\n### Crafting System Limitations\n- Complex items requiring assembly machines cannot be crafted by hand\n- Iron plates must be smelted in furnaces, cannot be crafted directly\n- Verify crafting prerequisites and methods before attempting to craft items"}
