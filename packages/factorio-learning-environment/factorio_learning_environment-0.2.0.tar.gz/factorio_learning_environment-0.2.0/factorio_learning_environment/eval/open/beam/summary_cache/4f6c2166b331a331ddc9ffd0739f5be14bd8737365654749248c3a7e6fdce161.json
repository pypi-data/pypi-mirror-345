{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\n  - Fuel: 3 units of coal\n  - Status: Working\n  - Ingredients: Iron ore\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility at Position (2.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (2.0, 0.0)\n  - Fuel: 2 units of coal\n  - Status: No ingredients to smelt\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (107.5, -33.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump at position (108.5, -28.5)\n  - Status: Not connected\n  - Warnings: No fluid present in connections\n- Boiler at position (111.5, -31.0)\n  - Fuel: 5 units of coal\n  - Status: Not connected\n  - Warnings: No input liquid, No fluid present in connections\n- Steam Engine at position (114.5, -30.5)\n  - Status: Not connected\n  - Warnings: Not connected to power network, No input liquid, No fluid present in connections\n\n### Research Lab at Position (5.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab at position (5.5, 0.5)\n  - Status: No power\n  - Research: Automation\n\n### Pipe Network\nConsists of the following entities:\n- PipeGroup at position (97.5, -46.5) with status: Empty\n- Other PipeGroups at various positions with status: Empty\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities without required items\n- Ensure that you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to place an entity. For example, a steam engine could not be placed because it was not in the inventory.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient materials for crafting\n- Verify that you have all required materials before starting a crafting process. For instance, crafting was attempted without sufficient iron plates for a steam engine.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into entities\n- Double-check the availability of items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into an entity. An error occurred when trying to insert copper ore into a furnace without having it in the inventory.\n\n### Assertion errors due to unmet conditions\n- Ensure that conditions are met before assertions are made in the code. For example, assertions failed due to not having enough iron plates in the furnace and failing to extract enough iron plates.\n\n### Errors when crafting locked items\n- Research necessary technologies before attempting to craft items that require them. For example, crafting an assembling machine failed because the automation technology was not researched.\n\n### Errors when placing entities on unsuitable terrain\n- Check the terrain suitability before placing entities. For example, attempts to place a boiler failed because the chosen position overlapped with water.\n\n### Errors due to missing fluid connections\n- Ensure that fluid connections are established between related entities. For example, the offshore pump and boiler are not connected, leading to warnings about missing fluid connections.\n\n### Name errors due to undefined variables\n- Verify that all variables are defined before use. For example, a NameError occurred due to an undefined variable 'required_pipes'.\n\n### Errors when connecting pipes without required items\n- Ensure you have the necessary pipes in your inventory before attempting to connect them. Multiple attempts to connect pipes failed due to insufficient pipes in the inventory.\n\n### Errors when crafting sub-ingredients\n- Ensure that all sub-ingredients required for crafting are available or can be crafted. For example, crafting iron gear wheels failed due to insufficient iron plates, which need to be smelted in a furnace.\n\n### Errors when connecting entities without required items\n- Ensure that you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to connect entities. For example, connecting pipes between the boiler and steam engine failed due to missing pipes in the inventory.\n\n### Errors when connecting entities with blocked connection points\n- Ensure that the connection points are not blocked by other entities. For example, attempts to connect the offshore pump to the boiler failed because the required connection points were blocked.\n\n### Errors when connecting entities due to missing items\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to connect entities. Multiple attempts to connect the offshore pump to the boiler failed due to missing pipes in the inventory."}
