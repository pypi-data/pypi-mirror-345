{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Collection System\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (41.0, -82.0) with a status of working, fueled by coal. \n- **Wooden Chest** at position (40.5, -83.5) used to collect mined coal. The chest inventory currently contains 7 units of coal.\n- **Transport Belt** connecting the burner mining drill to the wooden chest.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0) with a status of working, fueled by coal. It is used for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (1.5, 0.5) transferring items from a wooden chest to the stone furnace.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (2.5, 0.5) for storing iron ore before it is inserted into the furnace.\n- **Transport Belt** and **BeltGroup** connecting the inserter and wooden chest to the furnace.\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (10.0, 0.0) with a status of working, fueled by coal. It is used for smelting copper ore into copper plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (8.5, 0.5) transferring items from a wooden chest to the stone furnace.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (7.5, 0.5) for storing copper ore before it is inserted into the furnace.\n- **Transport Belt** and **BeltGroup** connecting the inserter and wooden chest to the furnace.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities on Occupied Tiles\n- Ensure you can place an entity on a tile before attempting placement. Check for existing objects that might obstruct the placement.\n\n### Errors Due to Missing Inventory Items\n- Before attempting to place or use an item, verify that it exists in your inventory to prevent errors related to missing items.\n\n### Errors with Incorrect Entity Retrieval\n- Double-check the positions and types of entities when using functions like `get_entity`. Ensure the entity exists at the specified location to avoid retrieval errors.\n\n### Attribute Errors with Position Objects\n- Avoid using attributes or methods on position objects that do not exist. Ensure the correct object type is being used for the intended operation.\n\n### Errors with Inspecting Inventory\n- When inspecting an inventory, ensure the entity at the specified position exists and is of the correct type to avoid inspection errors.\n\n### Errors with Transport Belt Blockages\n- Regularly check and clear transport belts to prevent blockages that can halt production processes."}
