{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo new structures have been successfully built on the map. Multiple attempts to place a Lab at position (0.5, 2.5) did not succeed because no Lab was available in inventory and its required sub\u2010ingredients (such as iron-gear-wheels, electronic circuits, and copper cables) were lacking. Although existing furnaces were retrieved for resource processing (an iron smelting furnace at Position(x=5.0, y=5.0) and a copper furnace at Position(x=-27.0, y=-60.0)), none of these operations resulted in a new structure being constructed by the agent.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 API Argument Misuse for get_entities:\n  \u2013 Avoid passing unexpected keyword arguments (e.g. \u201cradius\u201d) or incorrect positional arguments. Use the correct function signature when retrieving entities.\n  \n\u2022 Lab Crafting and Placement Failures:\n  \u2013 Confirm that the Lab exists in inventory before attempting placement.\n  \u2013 Ensure all required sub-ingredients (iron-gear-wheels, electronic circuits, copper cables) are sufficiently available; bolster the production chain (via smelting or crafting) prior to initiating Lab crafting.\n  \n\u2022 NoneType Handling:\n  \u2013 Validate that returned entity lists are not None before iterating over them. Using a fallback such as an empty list can prevent iteration errors.\n  \n\u2022 Resource Management:\n  \u2013 Check resource levels in advance to ensure that the complete chain of required ingredients is met, preventing repeated crafting errors for high-cost items like the Lab."}
