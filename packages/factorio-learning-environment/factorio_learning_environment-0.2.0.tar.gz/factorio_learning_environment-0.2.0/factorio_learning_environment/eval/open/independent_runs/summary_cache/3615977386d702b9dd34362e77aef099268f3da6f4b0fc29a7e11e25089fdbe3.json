{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining Station at (-15, -15)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (24.0, -15.0)\n- Wooden chest at (23.5, -16.5) containing 209 coal\n\n### Iron Mining Station at (-14, 23)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-14.0, 23.0) mining iron ore\n- Wooden chest at (-14.5, 21.5) containing 158 iron ore\n\n### Iron Smelting Line\nConsists of:\n- Two stone furnaces at (-11.0, 20.0) and (-9.0, 20.0)\nBoth furnaces have 23 coal as fuel but no ingredients\n\n### Copper Processing Complex at (20-24, 17-21)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (20.0, 20.0) mining copper ore\n- Collection chest at (20.5, 21.5) containing 208 copper ore\n- Secondary chest at (22.5, 21.5) containing 397 copper ore\n- Stone furnace at (24.0, 20.0) with 40 coal fuel\n- Output chest at (24.5, 17.5) containing 53 copper plates\n- Two burner inserters:\n  - One at (24.5, 18.5) moving items between furnace and output chest\n  - One at (22.5, 20.5) moving items between input chest and furnace\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Orientation Issues\n- Ensure inserter pickup and drop positions are correctly aligned with source and destination entities\n- When placing inserters, verify the direction allows proper movement of materials between connected entities\n\n### Resource Flow Issues\n- Despite having copper ore in input chests (397 + 208), furnaces show NO_INGREDIENTS status\n- Check if inserters are properly oriented to move materials from chests to furnaces\n- Ensure there is sufficient space in destination inventories (note \"chest is full\" warning)\n\n### Fuel Management\n- Some mining drills are running out of fuel (\"out of fuel\" warning)\n- Implement a fuel distribution system to keep all burner entities consistently supplied with coal"}
