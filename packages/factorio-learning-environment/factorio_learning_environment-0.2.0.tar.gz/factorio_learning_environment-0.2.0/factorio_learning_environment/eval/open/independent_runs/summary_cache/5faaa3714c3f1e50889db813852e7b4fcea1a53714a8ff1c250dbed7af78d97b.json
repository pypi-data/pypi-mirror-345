{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace (position 0.0, 0.0) which processes iron ore into iron plates. The furnace is currently working with an inventory of 39 iron ore and 100 iron plates.\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position (42.0, -83.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (position 42.0, -83.0) which extracts resources from the ground. The current status is working with an inventory of 1 coal.\n\n### Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of:\n- Wooden chest (position -14.5, -48.5) which stores iron ore. The current inventory contains 112 iron ore.\n\n### Wooden Chest at position (42.5, -81.5)\nConsists of:\n- Wooden chest (position 42.5, -81.5) which stores coal. The current inventory contains 610 coal.\n\n### Burner Inserters\nConsists of:\n- Burner inserter (position 42.5, -80.5) which is waiting for source items and has 18 coal in its inventory.\n- Burner inserter (position 43.5, -81.5) which is waiting for space in its destination and has 1 coal in its inventory.\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (position -15.0, -50.0) which extracts resources from the ground. The current status is working with no coal in its inventory.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n- **Errors when inserting fuel into the stone furnace while it is full**: \n  - Ensure the stone furnace has space for additional items before inserting more iron ore.\n  \n- **Errors when the burner mining drill runs out of fuel**: \n  - Regularly check the fuel status of the burner mining drill and ensure it is refueled to maintain its operation.\n\n- **Errors when the burner inserter is waiting for source items**: \n  - Ensure that the source inventory has sufficient items available for the inserter to operate.\n\n- **Errors when the burner inserter is waiting for space in destination**: \n  - Ensure that the destination inventory has space available for the items being inserted.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- **Utility Functions**: None defined yet.\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `iron_ore`: List of integers (amount of iron ore in various inventories).\n  - `coal`: List of integers (amount of coal in various inventories).\n  - `furnace_status`: String (status of the stone furnace).\n  - `drill_status`: String (status of the burner mining drill).\n  - `inserter_status`: String (status of the burner inserters)."}
