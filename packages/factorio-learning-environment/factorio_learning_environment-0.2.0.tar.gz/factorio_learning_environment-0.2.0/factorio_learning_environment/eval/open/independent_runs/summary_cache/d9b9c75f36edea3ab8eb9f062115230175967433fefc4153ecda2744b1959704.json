{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-59.5, -111.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (-59.5, -111.5) with warnings of not being connected to the power network and no input liquid.\n- Offshore Pump at position (-47.5, -123.5) connected through PipeGroup (fluid_system=76249) with pipes at positions such as (-52.5, -122.5), (-50.5, -122.5), and others.\n- Small Electric Poles at positions (-61.5, -110.5) and (-57.5, -110.5) intended to connect the steam engine to the power grid but not successfully connected.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -76.0) with a warning of being out of fuel and a full chest at the drop position.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-15.5, -77.5) containing iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -73.0) with a warning of no ingredients to smelt, fueled by coal.\n\n### Iron Plate Production\n- Stone Furnaces at positions (9.0, -64.0) and (6.0, -62.0), both with warnings of no ingredients to smelt, fueled by coal.\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) not receiving electricity, intended to transfer items between entities.\n\n### Miscellaneous\n- Wooden Chests at positions (7.5, -61.5) and (6.5, -59.5) containing various items.\n- Lab with no power, intended to research automation science packs.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Power Connection\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to connect entities. The connection attempt failed due to a missing Small Electric Pole.\n\n### Errors with Fuel and Ingredients\n- Regularly check and refuel mining drills and furnaces to prevent them from stopping due to lack of fuel.\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt to avoid warnings of no ingredients.\n\n### Errors with Electric Network\n- Verify that all electric poles are properly connected to the power network to ensure that entities like inserters receive power.\n\n### Errors with Chest Management\n- Regularly empty chests that are full to allow mining drills to continue operation without interruption."}
