{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron gear wheel production line at position around (16.0, 71.0) to (21.5, 73.5)\nConsists of the following connected entities forming a production chain for iron gear wheels:\n- Burner mining drill at position (16.0, 71.0) extracting iron ore, currently fueled with coal\n- Stone furnace at position (17.0, 73.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates, fueled and working but with a full source inventory\n- Burner inserters at positions (17.5, 71.5), (19.5, 73.5), and (23.5, 73.5) transferring items between mining drill, furnace, assembling machine, and chest; all fueled with coal but some waiting due to full chests or blocked outputs\n- Wooden chest at position (18.5, 73.5) collecting iron gear wheels, currently empty and causing inserters to wait\n- Assembling machine 2 at position (21.5, 73.5) set to craft iron gear wheels from iron plates, currently not powered and with no energy\n- Small electric poles at positions (18.5, 72.5), (18.5, 75.5), and (21.5, 75.5) intended to provide electricity connections; poles are connected but assembler still reports no power\n\nThis structure integrates mining, smelting, assembling, and storage within a compact area, connected by inserters and powered by electric poles, though power delivery to the assembler remains unresolved.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to assembler not receiving power despite pole connections\n- Ensure that electric poles are correctly placed within range of the assembling machine\u2019s connection points.\n- Verify that the power network is active and poles are connected to a power source.\n- Check for any missing or misplaced poles that might cause gaps in the power network.\n- Confirm that the assembling machine is compatible with the electric poles used and that it is not damaged or disabled.\n\n### Errors inserting coal into burner inserters and assembling machines due to inventory shortages\n- Before inserting coal into burner inserters or other entities, confirm that sufficient coal exists in the player\u2019s inventory.\n- Implement inventory checks and replenish coal resources proactively to avoid insertion failures.\n- Avoid repeated insertion attempts when inventory is empty to prevent redundant errors.\n\n### Errors placing transport belts due to lack of inventory or missing sub-ingredients\n- Maintain adequate inventory of transport belts before attempting placement.\n- Ensure that required sub-ingredients (e.g., iron plates) for crafting transport belts are available and that crafting machines or furnaces are operational to produce them.\n- Plan crafting sequences to produce necessary components before attempting to craft or place dependent items.\n\n### Errors caused by blocked outputs and full chests\n- Monitor output inventories such as chests to prevent them from becoming full, which causes inserters to wait and production to stall.\n- Implement logistics or expand storage capacity to handle produced items efficiently.\n- Clear blocked belts or inserter drop positions to maintain smooth item flow.\n\n### General tips to mitigate recurring errors\n- Always verify resource availability (coal, iron plates) before attempting insertion or crafting.\n- Confirm power network integrity and assembler power status regularly.\n- Check entity placement feasibility including inventory and tile occupancy before placing entities.\n- Manage inventory and crafting queues to ensure continuous production flow without resource starvation.\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nNo user-defined functions have been defined in the current steps."}
