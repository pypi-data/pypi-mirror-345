{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, -60.0)\n  - Connected to a **Wooden Chest** at position (4.5, -58.5) for iron ore collection.\n- **Furnaces** for smelting iron ore into iron plates:\n  - Furnace at position (-15.0, -48.0) with fuel status: 14 coal, output: 39 iron plates.\n  - Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0) with fuel status: 20 coal, output: 37 iron plates.\n  - Furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0) with fuel status: 25 coal, output: 37 iron plates.\n- **Storage Chests** for iron plates:\n  - Multiple chests at positions (-11.5, -50.5) to (-7.5, -50.5) storing iron plates, some of which are full.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors due to Insufficient Inventory for Insertion\n- Ensure that the required items (e.g., coal) are available in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. This will prevent errors like \"Could not insert: No coal to insert from your inventory.\"\n\n### Errors due to Full Chests\n- Regularly monitor and empty chests that are full to prevent warnings and ensure continuous operation of mining drills and other entities that rely on storage.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- **Utility Functions:**\n  - `insert_item`: Used for inserting items into entities. Ensure inventory checks are performed before calling this function to avoid insertion errors.\n\n- **Important Variables:**\n  - `furnace`: Represents a furnace entity being interacted with.\n  - `coal_to_insert`: Integer representing the amount of coal intended for insertion into a furnace."}
