{"content": "\"\"\"\nThe attempt to load stone into the active furnace has produced the following results:\n\n### Active Furnace Inventory Status:\n- The active furnace now shows **3 pieces of stone** remaining, indicating that **5 pieces of stone** were successfully inserted.\n- The furnace continues to hold **18 Iron Plates**, confirming that it has not yet processed any Copper Ore.\n\n### Overall Inventory Overview:\n- **Current Inventory**:\n  - 4 pieces of stone furnaces\n  - 7 pieces of coal\n  - **5 pieces of stone** remaining (after loading into the furnace)\n  - 5 pieces of iron ore\n  - **3 pieces of iron plates** available.\n\n### Observations:\n- The furnace is still in a **\"WORKING\"** status, but it has not yet begun processing the Copper Ore into Copper Plates.\n- The furnace now has the required stone to enable the recipe, but it appears that the Copper Ore is still not being processed.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Reinsert Copper Ore**: Since the furnace is now enabled, I will reinsert the Copper Ore to initiate the smelting process.\n2. **Monitor the Smelting Operation**: After reinserting the Copper Ore, I will check to see if the furnace begins processing it into Copper Plates.\n\nLet\u2019s proceed by reinserting the Copper Ore into the active furnace. \n\"\"\"\n\n# Reinserting Copper Ore into the active furnace to initiate the smelting process\ninsert_item(Prototype.CopperOre, active_furnace, quantity=2)  # Reinserting 2 pieces of Copper Ore\n\n# Check the inventory status of the furnace after reinserting Copper Ore\nactive_furnace_inventory_status_after_copper_insert = inspect_inventory(active_furnace)  # Inspect status of the furnace post-insertion\noverall_inventory_after_copper_loading = inspect_inventory()  # Check total inventory after loading.\n\nprint(f\"Active Furnace inventory status after reinserting Copper Ore: {active_furnace_inventory_status_after_copper_insert}\")  # Status of the furnace after loading Copper Ore.\nprint(f\"Overall current inventory after loading Copper Ore: {overall_inventory_after_copper_loading}\")  # Total inventory after operations.\nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")  # Review entities displayed on the map.", "summary_range": "[1-294]"}
