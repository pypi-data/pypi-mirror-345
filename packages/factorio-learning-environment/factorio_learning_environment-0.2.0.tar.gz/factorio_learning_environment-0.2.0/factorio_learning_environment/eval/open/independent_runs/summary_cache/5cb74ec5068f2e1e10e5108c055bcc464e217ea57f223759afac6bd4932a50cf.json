{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (x=41.0, y=-82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0) extracting coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=40.5, y=-83.5) for storing extracted coal.\n- Transport Belt connecting the mining drill to the chest.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=1.5, y=0.5) transferring items from the furnace to a wooden chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=2.5, y=0.5) for storing iron plates.\n- BeltGroup connecting the chest to further processing units.\n\n### Copper Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=10.0, y=0.0) for smelting copper ore into copper plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=11.5, y=0.5) transferring items from the furnace to a wooden chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=12.5, y=0.5) for storing copper plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Multiple inserters at positions (x=1.5, y=0.5), (x=3.5, y=0.5), (x=6.5, y=0.5), (x=8.5, y=0.5), and (x=11.5, y=0.5) are waiting for source items. Ensure that the connected chests or furnaces have items available for the inserters to transfer.\n\n### Chest Full Warnings\n- The chest at position (x=40.5, y=-83.5) is full, preventing further mining operations. Regularly check and clear out items from full chests to maintain continuous production.\n\n### Refueling Requirements\n- Ensure that all burner inserters and furnaces are adequately refueled to prevent interruptions in production. Regularly check fuel levels and refuel as necessary."}
