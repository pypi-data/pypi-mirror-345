{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage at Position (x=53.0, y=-83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=53.0, y=-83.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=52.5, y=-84.5) for coal storage.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (x=-20.0, y=-70.0) and Furnace at position (x=-18.0, y=-70.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-20.5, y=-66.5) waiting for source items, connected to a Furnace at position (x=-19.0, y=-65.0).\n- Furnace at position (x=-19.0, y=-65.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-17.5, y=-64.5) waiting for source items, connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=-16.5, y=-64.5) storing iron plates.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Transport at Position (x=-23.0, y=-68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-23.0, y=-68.0) connected to a transport belt network leading to a Wooden Chest at position (x=-23.5, y=-69.5) for copper ore storage.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Transport at Position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0) connected to a transport belt network leading to a Wooden Chest at position (x=-12.5, y=-54.5) for iron ore storage.\n\n### Miscellaneous Storage and Transport\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=1.5, y=0.5) storing coal, iron ore, and iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=2.5, y=0.5) waiting for source items, connected to Wooden Chests at positions (x=1.5, y=0.5) and (x=3.5, y=0.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using BeltGroup object\n- Ensure that the BeltGroup object has the correct attributes before accessing them. The error indicates that the 'BeltGroup' object does not have a 'direction' or 'tile_dimensions' attribute. Verify the object's properties and ensure they are correctly defined.\n\n### Errors when connecting transport belts\n- Make sure that the transport belts are correctly aligned and connected. The error indicates a failed attempt to connect belts due to indexing a nil value. Double-check the positions and connections of the belts to ensure they are valid and properly configured.\n\n### Inserter waiting for source items\n- Ensure that the inserters have access to the required source items. The inserters at positions (x=-20.5, y=-66.5), (x=-17.5, y=-64.5), and (x=2.5, y=0.5) are waiting for source items. Verify that the belts or chests supplying these inserters are functioning correctly and have the necessary items available."}
