Empty the chest at (x=-16.5, y=-52.5) to continue mining.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-16.5, y=-52.5)\n  - Inventory: Contains iron ore\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Fuel: Coal\n  - Furnace Source: Iron ore\n  - Furnace Result: Iron plate\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing Burner Inserter\n- Ensure the desired location for placing a Burner Inserter is not occupied by another entity or obstructed. Adjust the position accordingly before attempting to place it.\n\n### NameError: Undefined Variable\n- Ensure that all variables are defined before use. In the case of `chest_inserter`, verify that it is properly initialized and accessible in the current scope.\n\n### Errors when connecting belts directly from a Wooden Chest\n- Use an inserter to take items from a Wooden Chest before attempting to connect belts. Belts cannot be directly connected to a Wooden Chest.\n\n### Errors when inserting items with insufficient inventory\n- Verify that the inventory contains the required items before attempting to insert them into another entity. For example, ensure there is enough coal in the inventory before inserting it into a mining drill."}
