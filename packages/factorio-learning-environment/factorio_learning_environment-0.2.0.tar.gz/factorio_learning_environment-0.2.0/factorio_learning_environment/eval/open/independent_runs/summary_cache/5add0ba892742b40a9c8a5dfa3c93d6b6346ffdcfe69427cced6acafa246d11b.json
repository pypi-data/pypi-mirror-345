{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Lab at position (2.5, 1.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab (position (2.5, 1.5)) with status NO_POWER.\n\n### Boiler at position (-7.5, 23.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Boiler (position (-7.5, 23.0)) with status WORKING.\n- Small electric pole (position (-5.5, 21.5)).\n- Pipe (position (-9.5, 23.5)).\n- Offshore pump (position (-9.5, 24.5)).\n\n### Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position (0.0, 0.0)) with status NO_INGREDIENTS and fuel source full (50 coal).\n  \n### Furnace at position (5.0, 5.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position (5.0, 5.0)) with status NO_INGREDIENTS.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to power supply\n- Ensure that all structures requiring power (like the lab) are connected to a power source. Check the status of the power supply entities to confirm they are operational.\n\n### Errors when using attributes that do not exist\n- Avoid referencing attributes that may not exist on certain entities. For example, the boiler does not have an 'electrical_id'. Always verify the entity's capabilities before attempting to access its properties.\n\n### Errors when connecting entities\n- Ensure that the boiler is operational before attempting to connect it to other entities like the lab. Check the status of the boiler and ensure it has the necessary resources to function.\n\n### General placement errors\n- Ensure you can place an entity in a specific location before attempting to do so. Check for occupied tiles or other restrictions that may prevent placement."}
