{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at Position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (1 unit)\n  - Energy: 2666.67\n  - Status: Working\n  - Warnings: Output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Drop Position: (x=-16.5, y=-52.5)\n  - Resources: Iron Ore (40000 units)\n  - Neighbours: Stone Furnace\n- **Stone Furnace** at Position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (14 units)\n  - Energy: 1600.0\n  - Status: No Ingredients\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Furnace Result: Iron Plate (60 units)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Ensure that the target tile is free before attempting to place an entity. This includes checking for existing items or entities that may block placement.\n\n### Errors when attempting to place entities at incorrect positions\n- Verify the position coordinates before placing entities to ensure they are within valid bounds and not overlapping with other structures.\n\n### Errors due to blocked output from the mining drill\n- Ensure there is a sink entity, such as a chest or conveyor belt, to accept the output from the mining drill to prevent blockage.\n\n### Errors when attempting to interact with non-existent entities\n- Confirm the presence of the entity at the specified position before attempting any operations, such as extraction or interaction, to avoid errors related to missing entities."}
