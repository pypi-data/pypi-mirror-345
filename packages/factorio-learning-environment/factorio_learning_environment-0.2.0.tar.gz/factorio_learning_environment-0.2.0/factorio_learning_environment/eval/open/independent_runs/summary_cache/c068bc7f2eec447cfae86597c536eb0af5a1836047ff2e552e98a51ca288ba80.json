For example, crafting small electric poles requires wood and copper cables, which in turn require copper plates.\n- Gather necessary raw resources like wood and copper plates before crafting items that depend on them.\n\n### Errors When Placing or Connecting Small Electric Poles\n- Verify that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to place or connect small electric poles.\n- Ensure that the target location for placing small electric poles is valid and not already occupied by another entity.\n\n### Errors in Extracting Items\n- Make sure the target entity contains the items you wish to extract. For example, ensure that the stone furnace contains copper plates before attempting to extract them.\n\n### Connection Errors in Electric Network\n- Ensure that all components of the electric network are properly connected and powered. Check connections between small electric poles and the steam engine to ensure they are part of the same network.\n\n### Fuel Management Errors\n- Ensure that boilers have sufficient fuel to operate. Regularly check and insert coal or other fuels into boilers to maintain power generation."}
