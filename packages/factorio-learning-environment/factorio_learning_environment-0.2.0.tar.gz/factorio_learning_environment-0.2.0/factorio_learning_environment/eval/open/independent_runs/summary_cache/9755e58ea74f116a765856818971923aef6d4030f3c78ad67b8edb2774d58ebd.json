The sink chest placement initially failed because the player (at 0,0) was too far from (-14.5, -48.5).\n\u2003\u2013 Always confirm that the target tile is clear to avoid collisions with existing entities.\n\n\u2022 Neighbor Connection Refresh:\n\u2003\u2013 When persistent warnings occur (e.g., \u201cchest at drop position is full\u201d despite an empty chest), pick up and re-place connected inserters to update stale neighbor references.\n\n\u2022 Belt Network Material and Path Configuration:\n\u2003\u2013 Verify that you hold sufficient transport belts before connecting belt networks. Shortfalls in inventory (e.g., requiring 74 but having only 33) cause connection failures.\n\u2003\u2013 Ensure the selected path (or its segmented alternative) is valid and normalized before attempting a belt connection to avoid \u201cNot a valid path\u201d errors.\n\n\u2022 Crafting and Resource Pre-requisites:\n\u2003\u2013 Confirm availability of all sub-ingredients for composite items. Failures in crafting additional transport belts can result from missing intermediates (such as iron-gear-wheels, which in turn depend on sufficient iron plates).\n\u2003\u2013 Keep furnaces properly fueled; insertion errors (e.g., \u201cNo coal to insert\u201d) indicate a need to manage inventory supplies for continuous operation.\n\nNAMESPACE\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\nshift_entity_local(entity: Entity, offset: Tuple[float, float]) -> Entity\n\u2003\u2022 Shifts the given entity\u2019s position locally by the specified offset.\n\u2003\u2003\u2013 Invocation feedback: Successful repositioning noted but caution advised for potential repositioning issues.\n\nImportant Variables:\n\u2022 furnace_input_chest_pos (Position) \u2013 Holds the position of the furnace\u2019s input chest.\n\u2022 current_player_inventory (Inventory) \u2013 Tracks the current state of the player\u2019s inventory."}
