{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5) for coal extraction and storage.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Transport System at Position (-23.0, -68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-24.5, -67.5) for copper ore extraction.\n- Transport Belt group connecting the mining drill to the chest, facilitating the movement of copper ore.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage Facility at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -54.5) for iron ore extraction and storage.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5) for storing iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) for transferring items between entities.\n\n### Iron Plate Transport System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- BeltGroup connecting various positions to facilitate the movement of iron plates from furnaces to storage chests.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Ensure the target tile is unoccupied before attempting to place an entity. This will prevent placement errors like the one encountered when trying to place a wooden chest at (-25.0, -69.5).\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items."}
