{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0), connected to a Stone Furnace at position (x=41.0, y=-80.0).\n- The Stone Furnace is currently out of fuel and has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0), dropping into a Wooden Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5).\n\n### Copper Furnace\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-20.0, y=-71.0), currently out of fuel and has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Storage\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=43.5, y=-79.5), currently empty.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inventory Management\n- Ensure that there is sufficient coal in your inventory before attempting to insert coal into furnaces or drills. This will prevent errors related to \"No coal to insert from your inventory.\"\n\n### Errors when Furnaces are Out of Fuel\n- Regularly check the fuel levels of all furnaces to ensure they are operational. Furnaces will not function if they are out of fuel, leading to warnings and halted production.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `insert_item`: Used to insert items into entities. Ensure the source inventory has the required items before invoking this function to avoid insertion errors.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `iron_furnace`: Represents the iron furnace entity. Ensure it is adequately fueled and has the necessary ingredients for smelting.\n- `copper_furnace`: Represents the copper furnace entity. Monitor its fuel and ingredient levels to maintain production efficiency."}
