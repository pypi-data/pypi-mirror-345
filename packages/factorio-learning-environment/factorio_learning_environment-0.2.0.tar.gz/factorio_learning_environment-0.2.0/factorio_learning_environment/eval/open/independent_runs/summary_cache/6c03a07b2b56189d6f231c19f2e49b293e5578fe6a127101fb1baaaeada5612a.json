{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Setup at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nThis setup is designed for extracting and processing iron ore into iron plates. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore from the resource patch.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Temporarily stores extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0): Smelts iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-1.5, 0.5): Transfers iron plates from the furnace to another location.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Alignment Issues\n- Ensure that inserters are correctly aligned with their source and destination entities. Misalignment can cause them to not pick up or drop items correctly.\n\n### Refueling Errors\n- Always maintain a sufficient supply of fuel in your inventory to refuel mining drills and inserters. Lack of fuel can halt operations.\n\n### Furnace Input Issues\n- Verify that the inserter setup is correct and that the furnace is receiving the necessary iron ore to continue smelting operations. Regular checks can prevent production halts.\n\n### Inventory Management\n- Keep track of your inventory levels to ensure you have the necessary materials and fuel to sustain operations."}
