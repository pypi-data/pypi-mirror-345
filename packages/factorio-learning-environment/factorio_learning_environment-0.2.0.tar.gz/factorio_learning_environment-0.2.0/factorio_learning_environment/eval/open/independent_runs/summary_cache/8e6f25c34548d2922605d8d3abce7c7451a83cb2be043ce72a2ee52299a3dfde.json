{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-0.5, 25.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (-0.5, 25.5) \n- Boiler at position (-5.5, 25.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine with various pipes and underground pipes at positions such as (-8.5, 23.5) and (-7.5, 23.5).\n\n### Inserter and Power Network\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Inserters at positions (16.5, 0.5) and (17.5, 0.5) connected to a power network.\n- Small electric poles at various positions including (17.5, -0.5) to provide electricity to the inserters.\n\n### Furnace and Chest Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (15.0, 0.0) with status warnings indicating \"no ingredients to smelt.\"\n- Wooden Chests at positions (5.5, 0.5) and (18.5, 0.5) for storage of resources such as iron ore and other materials.\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- PipeGroup with fluid system 21883, positioned at (-1.5, 17.5), status: EMPTY.\n- PipeGroup with fluid system 21887, positioned at (-8.5, 20.5), status: FULL_OUTPUT, carrying water.\n- PipeGroup with fluid system 21896, positioned at (-7.5, 25.5), status: EMPTY.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Pipe Placement\n- Ensure that the target position for placing pipes or underground pipes is not already occupied by another entity. Remove existing entities before attempting to place new pipes.\n- Adjust the placement of underground pipe ends to ensure they connect properly with the existing pipe network.\n\n### Boiler and Steam Engine Connectivity Issues\n- Make sure that the boiler and steam engine are properly connected to the pipe network to ensure fluid flow and functionality. Check for any missing connections or misalignments.\n\n### Inserter Power Issues\n- Ensure that inserters are connected to a power source and that the power network is active to avoid status issues such as \"not receiving electricity.\"\n\n### Furnace Ingredient Issues\n- Provide the necessary ingredients to the stone furnace to avoid warnings such as \"no ingredients to smelt.\" Ensure that the inserter setup is correctly feeding the furnace with required materials."}
