{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position 0.0, 0.0) with fuel (coal) and inventory for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Stone furnace (position 0.0, 0.1) with inventory for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Copper plate production setup at position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position 0.0, 0.0) with inventory for smelting copper ore into copper plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n- Errors occurred when attempting to craft an assembling machine due to the recipe not being unlocked. Research Automation technology first to unlock the recipe.\n- Not enough Automation Science Packs to research Automation technology. Ensure to gather sufficient resources to craft Automation Science Packs.\n- Errors occurred when trying to set the recipe for copper plates in the stone furnace. Ensure that the stone furnace has enough copper ore before setting the recipe.\n- Not enough copper ore in the furnace to set the recipe for copper plates. Gather more copper ore before attempting to set the recipe.\n- Failed to craft Automation Science Pack due to insufficient copper plates. Ensure that you have the required crafting machines or smelting facilities to produce copper plates.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n- **Functions Defined**: \n  - `craft_item(Prototype.StoneFurnace)`: Failed due to missing sub-ingredients.\n  - `craft_item(Prototype.AssemblingMachine1)`: Failed due to recipe not being unlocked.\n  - `craft_item(Prototype.AutomationSciencePack)`: Failed due to inability to craft required sub-ingredient (copper-plate).\n  \n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `inventory: dict`: Current inventory of items (e.g., {'stone-furnace': 1, 'iron-ore': 10, 'iron-plate': 20}).\n  - `entities: list`: List of entities on the map (includes two stone furnaces).\n  - `furnace_inventory: dict`: Inventory of the stone furnace (e.g., {'iron-ore': 5, 'copper-ore': 1, 'copper-plate': 11})."}
