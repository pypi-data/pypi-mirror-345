{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll generate a comprehensive report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing System (around position x=41-45, y=-80-82)\nComplex system consisting of:\n- Burner mining drill (position x=41.0, y=-82.0) mining coal\n- Wooden chest for coal storage (position x=41.5, y=-80.5)\n- Transport belt moving right (input x=41.5, y=-81.5, output x=43.5, y=-81.5)\n- Two burner inserters:\n  1. First inserter (position x=42.5, y=-80.5) with variable direction\n  2. Second inserter (position x=43.5, y=-81.5) facing right\n- Stone furnace (position x=45.0, y=-81.0)\n\n### Iron Plate Storage\n- Wooden chest (position x=49.5, y=-80.5) containing iron plates\n- Second stone furnace (position x=47.0, y=-81.0) currently inactive\n\nERROR TIPS\n1. Furnace Operation Issues\n- Ensure furnaces have both fuel and ingredients before expecting operation\n- Monitor furnace warnings to maintain continuous operation\n- Address \"no ingredients to smelt\" warnings by ensuring proper material flow\n\n2. Inserter Configuration\n- The first inserter's direction keeps changing between LEFT and DOWN, which might indicate a configuration issue\n- Ensure inserter pickup and drop positions are consistently configured for the intended material flow\n\n3. Resource Management\n- Monitor fuel levels in burner mining drills - current drill is running low on coal (3 units)\n- Ensure proper fuel distribution to all burner-powered entities\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nImportant Variables:\n- EntityStatus (enum): WORKING, WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS, NO_INGREDIENTS, NO_FUEL, NORMAL\n- Direction (enum): UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT\n- Position (class): x, y coordinates\n- Inventory (class): Dictionary-like structure holding items and quantities\n\nEntity Types:\n- BurnerMiningDrill\n- Chest\n- BurnerInserter\n- Furnace\n- Belt\n\nEach entity has common properties:\n- name: string\n- direction: Direction\n- position: Position\n- status: EntityStatus\n- energy: float\n- height: float\n- width: float"}
