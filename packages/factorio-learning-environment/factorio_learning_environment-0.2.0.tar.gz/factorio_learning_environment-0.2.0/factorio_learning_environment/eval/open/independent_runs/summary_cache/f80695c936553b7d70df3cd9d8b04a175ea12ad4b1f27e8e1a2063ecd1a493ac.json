{"content": "Based on the new logs, I'll update the report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production (Position 0,0 and 2,0)\nTwo furnaces dedicated to producing iron plates:\n- Furnace 1 at (0,0) with coal fuel (6), processing iron ore (23) into iron plates (8)\n- Furnace 2 at (2,0) with coal fuel (6), processing iron ore (24) into iron plates (8)\nBoth furnaces are actively working\n\n### Copper Plate Production (Position 4,4 and 6,4)\nTwo furnaces dedicated to producing copper plates:\n- Furnace 3 at (4,4) with coal fuel (12), processing copper ore (10) into copper plates (8)\n- Furnace 4 at (6,4) with coal fuel (13), processing copper ore (10) into copper plates (8)\nBoth furnaces are actively working\n\n### Power Generation System (Position -7.5, 18.5)\nComplete power generation setup consisting of:\n- Steam engine at (-7.5, 18.5), working status, containing steam (200) at 165\u00b0\n- Boiler at (-7.5, 22.0), working status with coal fuel (8), containing water (200) and steam (200)\n- Offshore pump at (-7.5, 25.5), working status, containing water (100)\n- Connected pipe groups:\n  - Steam pipes at (-7.5, 15.5)\n  - Empty pipes at (-7.5, 20.5)\n  - Water pipes at (-8.5, 23.5)\n\n### Power Distribution Network\nExtensive power pole network operating at 600kV, connecting multiple areas including poles at:\n- (-9.5, 18.5), (-5.5, 18.5), (-1.5, 18.5)\n- (7.5, 7.5), (-4.5, 9.5), (7.5, 17.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Research and Technology Issues\n- Use correct technology names: 'logistic-science-pack' instead of 'LogisticSciencePack'\n- Check if technology is already researched before attempting to research it again\n- Verify technology prerequisites and required science packs before researching\n\n### Lab Location and Access Issues\n- Lab positions are not being found despite extensive searching patterns\n- Current search methods (exact positions, near power poles, grid pattern) are ineffective\n- Consider implementing a more systematic search pattern or verifying lab existence\n\n### Resource Management\n- Monitor coal levels in boiler - currently running out of fuel frequently\n- Maintain consistent fuel supply to prevent power generation interruptions\n- Ensure proper resource distribution between furnaces and boiler\n\n### Crafting Chain Dependencies\n- Iron plates cannot be hand-crafted, must be smelted in furnaces\n- When crafting complex items (like logistic science packs), ensure all prerequisites are available:\n  * Transport belts require iron plates\n  * Inserters require iron plates and electronic circuits\n  * Electronic circuits require iron plates and copper cables\n- Plan crafting sequences to maintain required intermediate products\n\n### Entity Connection Issues\n- When connecting entities (like boiler to steam engine), ensure connection points are not blocked\n- Verify proper spacing and orientation before attempting to connect entities\n- Check if required connection points are accessible before placing pipes\n\n### Inventory Management\n- Keep track of intermediate products needed for science pack production\n- Maintain sufficient stock of basic materials (iron plates, copper plates) before attempting complex crafting\n- Consider creating dedicated storage for frequently used intermediate products"}
