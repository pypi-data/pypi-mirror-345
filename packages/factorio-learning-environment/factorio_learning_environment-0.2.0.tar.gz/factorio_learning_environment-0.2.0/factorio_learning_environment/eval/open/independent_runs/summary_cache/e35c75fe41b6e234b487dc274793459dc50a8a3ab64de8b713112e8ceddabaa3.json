{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0) fueled by coal, actively working with 4 iron ore in the source and 79 iron plates produced.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-1.5, 0.5), fueled by coal, waiting for space in the destination. It picks up from position (-2.5, 0.5) and drops at position (-0.5, 0.5). A sink object is needed at (-0.5, 0.5) to unblock the inserter.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (2.5, 0.5) with no current inventory.\n- **Belt Group** connecting positions (1.5, 2.5) to (1.5, 0.5) and (1.5, 1.5) to (1.5, -0.5), consisting of 2 belts, currently empty.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Ensure the target position is free before placing an entity. If an error occurs indicating an entity already exists at the target position, remove the obstructing entity first.\n\n### Inserter waiting for space in destination\n- Ensure there is space in the destination for the inserter to drop items. Place a sink object at the specified drop position to prevent the inserter from being blocked.\n\n### Inserter waiting for source items\n- Verify that the source supply is adequate for the inserter to function. Check input supply to ensure continuous operation."}
