{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Coal Transfer System at Position (40.5, -83.5) to (42.5, -83.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest at position (40.5, -83.5) with inventory containing 800 coal.\n- Burner mining drill at position (41.0, -82.0) with coal fuel and status indicating waiting for space in destination.\n- Burner inserter at position (41.5, -83.5) with coal fuel, transferring items between chests.\n- Wooden chest at position (42.5, -83.5) with inventory containing 171 coal.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (61.0, -54.0) with coal fuel, actively converting iron ore to iron plates.\n- Furnace at position (64.0, -53.0) with coal fuel, actively converting iron ore to iron plates.\n- Wooden chests at positions (61.5, -52.5), (62.5, -53.5), and (62.5, -52.5) each containing coal.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors due to Full Inventory in Chests\n- Ensure that chests used for storage have sufficient space to receive items from mining drills and inserters. Regularly check and empty chests to prevent blockage in the production line.\n\n### Errors when Mining Drill and Inserter are Waiting for Space\n- Monitor the status of mining drills and inserters to ensure they are not in a waiting state due to full destination chests. Adjust the logistics to maintain a smooth flow of resources.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- No utility functions or important variables have been defined or invoked in the provided execution steps."}
