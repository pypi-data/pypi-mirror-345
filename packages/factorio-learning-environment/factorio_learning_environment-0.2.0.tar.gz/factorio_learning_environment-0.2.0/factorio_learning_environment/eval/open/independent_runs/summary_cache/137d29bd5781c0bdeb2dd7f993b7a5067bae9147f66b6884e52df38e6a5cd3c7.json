{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Boiler at position(-24.5, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Boiler (position -24.5, -50.0) connected to pipes (positions -24.5, -51.5; -23.5, -51.5; -22.5, -51.5; -22.5, -50.5; -22.5, -49.5; -22.5, -48.5)\n\n### Steam Engine at position(-29.5, 30.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine (position -29.5, 30.5) which is currently not connected to a power network\n\n### Offshore Pump at position(-10.5, 25.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump (position -10.5, 25.5) connected to pipes (positions -11.5, 23.5; -10.5, 24.5; -11.5, 24.5)\n\n### Pipe Groups\n- Pipe Group (fluid system 52873, position -24.5, -51.5) with pipes connecting various entities\n- Pipe Group (fluid system 52912, position -4.5, 21.5) with pipes connecting various entities\n- Pipe Group (fluid system 52913, position -4.5, 23.5) with pipes connecting various entities\n\n### Labs\n- Lab (position not specified, status: NO_POWER)\n\n### Electricity Group\n- Electricity Group (id 244499) with small electric poles at various positions including (-22.5, 20.5), (-20.5, 20.5), (-19.5, 20.5), and (-27.5, 29.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting boiler to steam engine\n- Ensure that pipes are correctly placed and connected. Check the positions of the boiler and steam engine to ensure they are within the connection range of the pipes.\n\n### Errors when lab has no power\n- Make sure that the lab is connected to a power network. Verify that there are sufficient power sources connected to the electricity grid.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it."}
