{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Setup at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nThis setup is designed to extract and process iron ore into iron plates. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and deposits it into the adjacent chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace. It is currently misaligned and not functioning correctly.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates, but currently not receiving any ore due to the inserter misalignment.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Misalignment of Inserter\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly aligned to transfer items from the chest to the furnace. Reposition the inserter so that its pickup and drop positions are correctly set.\n\n### Inserter Running Out of Fuel\n- Regularly refuel the inserter to ensure continuous operation. Consider automating the refueling process if possible.\n\n### Mining Drill Out of Fuel\n- Keep the mining drill fueled to prevent interruptions in ore extraction. Automate fuel supply to the drill if feasible.\n\n### Chest Full Warning\n- Regularly empty the chest to prevent it from becoming full, which halts the mining operation. Consider expanding storage capacity or processing the ore more efficiently.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Ingredients\n- Check the inserter alignment and ensure it is transferring ore to the furnace. Address any misalignment issues promptly to resume smelting operations.\n\n### General Maintenance\n- Regularly check the status of all entities to ensure they are operational and address any warnings or errors immediately."}
