{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, y=-60.0) with a drop position at (4.5, y=-58.5). This drill is currently out of fuel and its drop position chest is full.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions:\n  - (5.5, y=-60.5)\n  - (4.5, y=-58.5)\n  - (7.5, y=-60.5)\n  - (6.5, y=-60.5)\n  - (9.5, y=-60.5)\n  - (8.5, y=-60.5)\n  - (-14.5, y=-50.5)\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions:\n  - (-15.0, y=-48.0) with a fuel inventory containing coal and a result inventory containing iron plates.\n  - (-13.0, y=-48.0) with a fuel inventory containing coal and a result inventory containing iron plates.\n  - (-11.0, y=-48.0) with a fuel inventory containing coal, but no ingredients to smelt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Out of Fuel\n- Ensure that all mining drills and furnaces have sufficient fuel to operate. Regularly check and refuel entities to prevent interruptions in production.\n\n### Errors due to Full Storage\n- Regularly check and empty chests at drop positions to prevent mining drills from halting operations due to full storage.\n\n### Errors due to No Ingredients to Smelt\n- Ensure that furnaces have a continuous supply of raw materials to process. Monitor the input inventory of furnaces and supply them with necessary ingredients to maintain production.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions**: None defined.\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `iron-plate`: int, current count is 6634.\n  - `iron-gear-wheel`: int, current count is 4.\n  - `wooden-chest`: int, current count is 3."}
