{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Coal Mining and Collection Facility at Position (52.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (52.0, -82.0) operational and extracting coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -79.5) repositioned to collect coal.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility at Position (-12.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-12.0, -51.0) operational and extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-11.5, -48.5) repositioned to collect iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) operational and smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors Related to Space in Destination\n- Ensure that there is adequate space or a sink entity to accept the output from mining drills. This will prevent the \"WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION\" status and ensure continuous operation.\n\n### Errors Related to No Ingredients in Furnace\n- Regularly check and supply the necessary ingredients to the stone furnace to avoid the \"NO_INGREDIENTS\" status. This can be mitigated by ensuring a consistent supply of iron ore and fuel.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- **Utility Functions**: None defined.\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `coal`: int, current inventory count is 13.\n  - `iron-ore`: int, current inventory count is 1.\n  - `iron-plate`: int, current inventory count is 12."}
