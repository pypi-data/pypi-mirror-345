{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo new structures have been successfully created during these steps. Multiple attempts were made to place a Lab at position (0.5, 2.5), but all failed due to unavailable lab items and resource shortages. Although furnaces (one at Position(x=5.0, y=5.0) and another at Position(x=-27.0, y=-60.0)) were retrieved for smelting operations, these were pre\u2010existing entities and not newly built by the agent.\n\nERROR TIPS\n- Incorrect API usage for entity retrieval:\n  \u2022 Avoid supplying unsupported keyword arguments (e.g. \u201cradius\u201d) or extra positional arguments to get_entities. Always verify the expected signature before calling the function.\n  \n- Lab placement failures:\n  \u2022 Ensure that the required lab item is available in the inventory before attempting placement.\n  \u2022 Check that any function returning entities does not yield None; if so, substitute with an empty list to safely iterate.\n  \n- Lab crafting errors due to missing sub-ingredients:\n  \u2022 Confirm that all necessary sub-components (such as iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, copper-cables, and their precursor items) are available or can be properly produced.\n  \u2022 Validate the complete resource chain\u2014including appropriate smelting or crafting capabilities\u2014prior to initiating lab production.\n  \n- Consistent resource shortages:\n  \u2022 Monitor and update resource production (e.g. through additional smelting steps) to meet the requirements of complex recipes before reattempting crafting operations."}
