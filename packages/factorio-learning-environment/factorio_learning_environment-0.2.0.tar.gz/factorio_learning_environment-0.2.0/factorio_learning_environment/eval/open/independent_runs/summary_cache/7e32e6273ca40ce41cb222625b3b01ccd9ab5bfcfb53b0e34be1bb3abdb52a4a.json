{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Oil Extraction System at (17.5,40.5)\n- **Pumpjack** at (17.5,40.5) - Extracts crude oil (299970 crude oil remaining)\n- **Storage tank** at (21.5,41.5) - Stores crude oil (currently holding 39.2 crude oil)\n- Connected by PipeGroup (fluid_system=610) for crude oil transport\n\n### Power Generation System at (26.5,42.0)\n- **Offshore pump** at (-11.5,21.5) - Provides water\n- **Boiler** at (26.5,42.0) - Burns coal to heat water (currently has 41 coal)\n- **Steam engine** at (29.5,42.5) - Generates 13500 energy from steam\n- Connected by:\n  - PipeGroup (fluid_system=601) for water transport\n  - PipeGroup (fluid_system=611) for steam transport\n- Powered by electricity group (id=374) with 6 small electric poles\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Pipe network access errors\n- Verify pipe groups exist before accessing them (StopIteration error when querying fluid_system=249)\n- Use get_entities() with proper filters to locate existing pipe groups\n\n### Power connection issues\n- Ensure power poles are properly connected to all electrical devices\n- Verify power production meets consumption requirements\n\n### Inventory management\n- Check inventory capacity before attempting to insert items\n- Boiler can only hold 50 coal - don't attempt to insert more than capacity\n\n### Fluid system monitoring\n- Track fluid system IDs as they may change (original water system 249 not found, new system is 601)\n- Verify fluid connections when adding new pipes or tanks\n\n### General placement\n- Verify target position is clear before placing new entities\n- Ensure proper spacing between entities to allow connections\n\n### Production monitoring\n- Current oil production (848/min) exceeds target (250/min) by 339%\n- Consider optimizing pumpjack operation if resource conservation is desired"}
