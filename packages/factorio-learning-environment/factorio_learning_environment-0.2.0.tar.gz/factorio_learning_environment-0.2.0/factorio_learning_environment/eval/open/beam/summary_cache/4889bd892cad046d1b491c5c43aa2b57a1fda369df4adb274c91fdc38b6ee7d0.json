{"content": "It seems there was an oversight in the code where the variable `wood_required` was not defined before being used. Let's correct this by defining the necessary constants at the beginning of the script and ensure the logic is clear and complete.\n\nHere's the revised code:\n\n```python\n# Define constants for crafting requirements\nwood_required_per_pole = 2\ncopper_cable_required_per_pole = 1\n\n# Step 1: Check current inventory for Small Electric Poles and materials\ninventory = inspect_inventory()\navailable_wood = inventory.get(Prototype.Wood, 0)\navailable_copper_cable = inventory.get(Prototype.CopperCable, 0)\navailable_poles = inventory.get(Prototype.SmallElectricPole, 0)\n\n# Calculate how many poles are needed\npoles_needed = 3 - available_poles\n\n# Step 2: Gather resources if necessary\nif poles_needed > 0:\n    # Calculate additional resources needed\n    additional_wood_needed = max(0, poles_needed * wood_required_per_pole - available_wood)\n    additional_copper_cable_needed = max(0, poles_needed * copper_cable_required_per_pole - available_copper_cable)\n\n    # Gather additional wood if needed\n    if additional_wood_needed > 0:\n        wood_position = nearest(Resource.Wood)\n        move_to(wood_position)\n        gather_wood = harvest_resource(wood_position, quantity=additional_wood_needed)\n        assert gather_wood >= additional_wood_needed, f\"Failed to gather sufficient wood. Needed: {additional_wood_needed}, Gathered: {gather_wood}\"\n\n    # Craft additional copper cable if needed\n    if additional_copper_cable_needed > 0:\n        craft_item(Prototype.CopperCable, quantity=additional_copper_cable_needed)\n\n# Step 3: Craft the necessary Small Electric Poles\nif poles_needed > 0:\n    crafted_poles = craft_item(Prototype.SmallElectricPole, quantity=poles_needed)\n    assert crafted_poles == poles_needed, f\"Failed to craft required number of Small Electric Poles. Needed: {poles_needed}, Crafted: {crafted_poles}\"\n\n# Step 4: Place Small Electric Poles to power the assembling machine\ncurrent_position = Position(x=2.5, y=1.5)\nfor i in range(poles_needed):\n    move_to(current_position)\n    placed_pole = place_entity(Prototype.SmallElectricPole, Direction.UP, current_position)\n    assert placed_pole, f\"Failed to place Small Electric Pole {i+1}.\"\n    current_position = Position(x=current_position.x + 1.0, y=current_position.y)\n\n# Step 5: Connect the assembling machine to the power network\nfor pole in get_entities({Prototype.SmallElectricPole}):\n    connect_entities(pole, assembling_machine_entity, connection_type=Prototype.SmallElectricPole)\n\n# Step 6: Insert materials into the assembling machine for Copper Cable production\ncopper_plates_quantity = inventory.get(Prototype.CopperPlate, 0)\ninsert_item(Prototype.CopperPlate, assembling_machine_entity, quantity=copper_plates_quantity)\ninsert_item(Prototype.IronPlate, assembling_machine_entity, quantity=5)\n\n# Allow time for operations to complete\nsleep(10)\n\n# Verify and report the final state\nfinal_inventory = inspect_inventory()\nassembling_machine_inventory = inspect_inventory(assembling_machine_entity)\n\nprint(f\"Final Inventory: {final_inventory}\")\nprint(f\"Assembling Machine Inventory: {assembling_machine_inventory}\")\nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- **Define Constants**: Always define constants at the beginning of your script for clarity and ease of maintenance.\n- **Resource Management**: Check and gather resources before crafting to ensure you have the necessary materials.\n- **Error Handling**: Use assertions to check for successful actions and provide informative error messages.\n- **Iterative Placement**: When placing multiple entities, ensure they are positioned correctly to maintain connectivity.", "summary_range": "[1-102]"}
