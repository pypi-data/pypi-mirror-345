Verify the chest's inventory and position.\n\n### Errors when placing entities into occupied tiles\n- Before placing an entity, check if the target tile is free from other entities. Adjust the spacing, direction, or reference position if necessary to avoid collisions.\n\n### Errors when placing entities with incorrect spacing or direction\n- Verify the surrounding area for potential obstructions or invalid placement zones. Consider increasing the spacing or changing the direction to ensure successful placement."}
