{"content": "# The current map has a stone furnace positioned at (0.0, 0.0) with 4 coal as fuel, but it has no ingredients to smelt. This indicates that I need to connect a resource source, like a mining drill, to the furnace to enable it to process materials.\n# \n# Since I currently do not have a mining drill placed, I should consider placing one nearby to feed resources into the furnace. After placing the mining drill, I can then use the transport belt to connect the drill's output to the furnace's input.\n# \n# Next, I will:\n# 1. Craft a Burner Mining Drill to extract resources.\n# 2. Place the mining drill near the furnace.\n# 3. Use the transport belt to connect the drill to the furnace.\n\n# First, I need to ensure I have the necessary materials to craft the Burner Mining Drill.\nensure_craftable(Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill)  # Ensuring I can craft a Burner Mining Drill.", "summary_range": "[1-68]"}
