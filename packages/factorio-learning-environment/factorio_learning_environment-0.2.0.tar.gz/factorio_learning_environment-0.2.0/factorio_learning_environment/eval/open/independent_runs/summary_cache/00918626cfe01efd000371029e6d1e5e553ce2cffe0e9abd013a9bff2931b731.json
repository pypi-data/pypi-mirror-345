{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Collection System at Position (42.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (42.0, -83.0) extracting coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (42.5, -81.5) transferring coal from the mining drill.\n- Wooden Chest intended to collect coal, but placement issues persist.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -49.0) processing iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Data Type and Object Handling\n- Ensure that the data types used in calculations and assignments are compatible. For example, when using `int()`, ensure the argument is a string, bytes-like object, or real number.\n- Avoid using objects incorrectly, such as treating a 'Position' object as callable.\n\n### Errors with Entity Placement\n- Before placing an entity, verify that the intended position is not already occupied by another object to prevent placement errors.\n- When aligning entities, ensure that the target position is clear and suitable for the entity being placed.\n\n### Errors with Inserter and Drill Alignment\n- Regularly check and adjust the alignment of inserters and drills to ensure they are correctly positioned to transfer items efficiently.\n- Ensure that the inserter's drop position is aligned with the receiving entity to prevent output blockages.\n\n### Errors with Output Blockages\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity in place to accept the output from drills and furnaces to prevent blockages and inefficiencies in production lines."}
