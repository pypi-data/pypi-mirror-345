{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Water Extraction and Power Generation Setup (near x=-9, y=71 and x=74, y=63)\n\nThis setup extracts water, heats it in boilers, and uses steam engines to generate power. It is partially connected to an electrical grid.\n*   **Offshore Pump** at position (x=-9.5, y=71.5): Extracts water from the lake. Status: WORKING.\n*   **PipeGroup** starting at (x=-8.5, y=71.5): Transports water from the Offshore Pump to the Boilers. Consists of multiple pipe segments connecting (x=-8.5, y=71.5) to (x=69.5, y=71.5"}
