Iron plates must be crafted in a stone furnace or other crafting machine. Place a stone furnace and insert iron ore and coal into it to produce iron plates.\n\n### Cannot place entity without having it in inventory\n- The agent attempted to place a burner mining drill without having one in its inventory. Craft the burner mining drill before attempting to place it.\n\n### Cannot harvest if out of reach\n- The agent attempted to harvest a resource that was out of reach. Move closer to the resource before attempting to harvest it.\n\n### Cannot insert item if not in inventory\n- The agent attempted to insert coal into a furnace without having any coal in its inventory. Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into a building.\n\n### Missing ingredients for crafting\n- The agent is attempting to craft a burner mining drill but is missing the required ingredients. The agent needs to craft iron plates and iron gear wheels first. Ensure you have all the necessary ingredients before attempting to craft an item.\n- The agent is attempting to craft a burner mining drill but is missing stone to craft a stone furnace, which is a sub-ingredient. Mine stone before attempting to craft the burner mining drill. Note that stone cannot be crafted, it must be gathered as a raw resource.\n\n### NAMESPACE\nNo functions have been defined by the agent.\n\nImportant variables:\n- None\n"}
