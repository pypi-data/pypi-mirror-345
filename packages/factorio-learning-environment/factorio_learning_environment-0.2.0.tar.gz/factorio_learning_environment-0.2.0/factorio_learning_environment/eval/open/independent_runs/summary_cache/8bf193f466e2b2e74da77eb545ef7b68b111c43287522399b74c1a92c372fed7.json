{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Collection Facility at position (x=52.0, y=-82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=52.0, y=-82.0) for extracting coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=52.5, y=-79.5) for moving items.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=52.5, y=-77.5) for storing extracted coal.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility at position (x=-12.0, y=-51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-12.0, y=-51.0) for extracting iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-11.5, y=-48.5) for moving items.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-8.5, y=-49.5) for storing smelted iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Ensure Continuous Supply of Ingredients and Fuel\n- The Stone Furnace at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0) frequently becomes non-operational due to a lack of ingredients. Ensure a continuous supply of iron ore to maintain smelting operations.\n- The Iron Ore Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-12.0, y=-51.0) was non-operational due to a lack of fuel. Ensure a consistent supply of coal to keep the drill operational.\n\n### Address Output Blockages\n- Both the Coal and Iron Ore Burner Mining Drills report warnings of \"output blocked by item on the ground.\" Ensure that there is a sink entity, such as a chest or a conveyor belt, to accept the output from these drills to prevent blockages.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- None defined.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the current inventory of resources, including 'coal', 'iron-ore', and 'iron-plate'."}
