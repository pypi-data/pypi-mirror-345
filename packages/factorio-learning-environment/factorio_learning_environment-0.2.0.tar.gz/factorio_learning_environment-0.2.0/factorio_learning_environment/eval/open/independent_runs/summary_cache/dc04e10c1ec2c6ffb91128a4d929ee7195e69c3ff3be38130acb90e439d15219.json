{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Network\n- Expanded power network connecting the lab at position (5.5, 5.5) to the power source at position (10.5, 34.5).\n- Consists of multiple electric poles at positions such as (7.5, 13.5), (13.5, 27.5), (9.5, 23.5), (16.5, 31.5), and (12.5, 34.5).\n\n### Steam Power Generation System\n- Offshore Pump at position (-3.5, 27.5) supplying water.\n- Boiler at position (0.5, 28.0) with no fuel.\n- Steam Engine at position (10.5, 34.5) not connected to the boiler.\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine, with sections at positions such as (-3.5, 26.5), (-1.5, 28.5), and (10.5, 31.5).\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (40.0, -84.0) extracting coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (40.5, -82.5) storing extracted coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (54.5, -83.5) waiting for source items.\n- Belt system transporting coal, with segments at positions such as (50.5, -86.5) to (48.5, -86.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Storage\n- Iron Chests at positions (0.5, 0.5), (1.5, 0.5), and (2.5, 0.5) storing coal and iron plates.\n\n### Copper Plate Production\n- Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -49.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Connecting Boiler to Steam Engine\n- Ensure that pipes are correctly placed and connected between the boiler at position (0.5, 28.0) and the steam engine at position (10.5, 34.5).\n- Verify that all necessary pipes are in place and that there are no gaps in the fluid network.\n\n### Errors with Fuel Management\n- Regularly refuel the boiler to avoid interruptions in power generation.\n- Ensure that the burner mining drill and other fuel-dependent entities have a sufficient supply of coal.\n\n### Inventory Management\n- Regularly check and empty the chest at position (40.5, -82.5) to prevent mining interruptions due to a full inventory.\n\n### Power Network Issues\n- Verify that all electric poles are correctly connected and that there are no breaks in the electricity network.\n- Ensure that the lab and other powered entities are connected to the power network and receiving electricity."}
