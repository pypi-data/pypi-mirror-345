{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0) fueled by coal, smelting iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter 1** at position (1.5, 0.5), transferring iron plates from the furnace to the wooden chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (2.5, 0.5) storing iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter 2** at position (3.5, 0.5), extracting iron plates from the wooden chest and placing them onto the transport belt.\n- **Transport Belt** connecting from position (3.5, 0.5) to position (6.5, 0.5), moving iron plates towards the end chest.\n- **Burner Inserter 3** at position (6.5, 0.5), transferring iron plates from the transport belt to the end wooden chest.\n- **End Wooden Chest** at position (7.5, 0.5) collecting iron plates from the belt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied positions\n- Ensure that the target position for placing an entity is not already occupied by another entity. Consider adjusting the spacing, direction, or reference position to avoid overlap.\n\n### Errors when connecting belts directly from a chest\n- Use an inserter to extract items from a chest before connecting them to a transport belt. Belts cannot be directly connected to a chest.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient inventory items\n- Verify that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to place or craft entities. For example, ensure you have enough wooden chests or the raw materials needed to craft them.\n\n### Errors when crafting without required raw materials\n- Gather necessary raw materials before crafting. For instance, wood must be gathered as it is a raw resource not craftable through recipes.\n\n### Errors when inserting items without having them in inventory\n- Ensure you have the items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into an entity."}
