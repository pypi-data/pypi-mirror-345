{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-16.0, -51.0) with a drop position at (-16.5, -52.5). It contains 40,000 units of iron ore but is currently out of fuel.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) with 14 units of coal as fuel. It has an energy level of 1600.0 but lacks ingredients to smelt. The furnace has produced 60 iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied or invalid positions\n- Ensure that the target position for placing entities like Wooden Chests, Stone Furnaces, Burner Inserters, and Transport Belts is unoccupied and valid for placement. This will prevent errors such as \"Cannot place [entity] at the desired location.\"\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items. This will prevent extraction errors due to being out of range or not having the correct entity in place.\n\n### Errors due to missing entities\n- Verify the presence of entities at specified positions before attempting operations like extraction or interaction. This will avoid errors such as \"Could not find a valid burner-mining-drill entity containing iron-ore\" or \"No entity of type stone-furnace found at the specified position.\"\n\n### Errors due to lack of fuel or ingredients\n- Regularly check the fuel levels of your machines and ensure they have the necessary ingredients to operate. This will prevent warnings like \"out of fuel\" for mining drills and \"no ingredients to smelt\" for furnaces."}
