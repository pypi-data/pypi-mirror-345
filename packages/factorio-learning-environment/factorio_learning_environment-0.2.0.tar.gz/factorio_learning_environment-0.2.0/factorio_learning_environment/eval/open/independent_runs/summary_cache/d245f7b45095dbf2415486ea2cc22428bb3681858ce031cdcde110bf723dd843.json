{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (4.0, -60.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, -60.0)\n  - Status: Out of fuel\n  - Warnings: Chest at drop position is full. Empty the chest at (4.5, -58.5) to continue mining.\n  - Drop position: (4.5, -58.5)\n  - Resources: Iron ore (10,000 units)\n- **Wooden Chests** for storage:\n  - Chest at position (5.5, -60.5)\n  - Chest at position (4.5, -58.5)\n  - Chest at position (7.5, -60.5)\n  - Chest at position (6.5, -60.5)\n  - Chest at position (9.5, -60.5)\n  - Chest at position (8.5, -60.5)\n  - Chest at position (-14.5, -50.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Smelting Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-15.0, -48.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (9 units)\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Status: No ingredients\n  - Result: Iron plate (56 units)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-13.0, -48.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (40 units)\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Status: No ingredients\n  - Result: Iron plate (41 units)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-11.0, -48.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (50 units)\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt, Furnace fuel source is full\n  - Status: No ingredients\n  - Result: None\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors due to Out of Fuel\n- Ensure that all mining drills have sufficient fuel to operate. Regularly check and refill fuel as needed to prevent interruptions in mining operations.\n\n### Errors due to Full Storage\n- Regularly monitor and empty chests at drop positions to prevent mining drills from halting due to full storage.\n\n### Errors due to Lack of Ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Regularly supply raw materials to furnaces to maintain continuous production.\n\n### Errors due to Full Furnace Fuel Source\n- Monitor the fuel levels in furnaces and ensure that they do not exceed capacity to avoid wastage and operational halts.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- **Utility Functions**: None defined in the logs.\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `final_inventory`: Dict[str, int] = {'wooden-chest': 3, 'iron-plate': 6634, 'iron-gear-wheel': 4}"}
