{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) with a furnace at position (41.0, -80.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (43.5, -79.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Mine at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) with a wooden chest at position (-14.5, -48.5)\n\n### Copper Furnace at Position (-20.0, -71.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -71.0)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Insufficient Inventory Items\n- Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. For example, attempting to insert coal into a furnace when there is no coal in the inventory will result in an error.\n\n### Errors When Entities Run Out of Fuel\n- Regularly check and refuel entities such as burner mining drills and furnaces to prevent them from running out of fuel and halting production.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Ingredients in Furnaces\n- Make sure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Without ingredients, the furnace will not function, even if it has fuel.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `insert_item`: A function used to insert items into entities. Ensure that the item and quantity are available in the inventory before invoking this function to avoid exceptions.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `iron_furnace`: Represents the iron furnace entity.\n- `copper_furnace`: Represents the copper furnace entity.\n- Inventory variables such as `stone-furnace`, `wood`, `coal`, `stone`, `iron-plate`, and `copper-plate` are tracked to manage resources effectively."}
