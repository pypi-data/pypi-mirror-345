{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Complex at (-10, -59)\nConsists of following entities:\n- Three burner mining drills in a row at positions (-10, -59), (-8, -59), and (-6, -59)\n- Two wooden chests at (-9.5, -57.5) and (-7.5, -57.5) collecting iron ore from first two drills\n- Stone furnace at (-5, -57) connected to the third drill\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line at (0, 0)\nConsists of following entities:\n- Four stone furnaces in a row at positions (0, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), and (6, 0)\n- Four wooden chests with coal at (0.5, -2.5), (2.5, -2.5), (4.5, -2.5), and (6.5, -2.5)\n- Four burner inserters at (0.5, -1.5), (2.5, -1.5), (4.5, -1.5), and (6.5, -1.5) moving coal from chests to furnaces\n- Four wooden chests at (0.5, 2.5), (2.5, 1.5), (4.5, 1.5), and (6.5, 1.5) for collecting iron plates\n- Two burner inserters at (0.5, 1.5) and (7.5, 0.5) moving products from furnaces to storage chests\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities without required items in inventory\n- Check inventory contains required items before attempting to place entities\n- Ensure you have wooden chests in inventory before trying to place them\n\n### Errors when managing furnace fuel\n- Check coal availability in inventory before attempting to insert fuel into furnaces\n- Consider implementing a fuel checking system before starting furnace operations\n\n### Structure placement optimization\n- The third mining drill's output is partially blocked due to missing chest\n- Ensure complete output collection system is in place before starting mining operations\n\n### Resource management\n- Multiple furnaces are showing \"no ingredients to smelt\" warnings\n- Implement better resource flow management to keep furnaces supplied with materials"}
