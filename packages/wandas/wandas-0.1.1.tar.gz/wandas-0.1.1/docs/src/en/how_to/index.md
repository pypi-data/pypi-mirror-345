# Cookbook (Use Case Recipes)

This section provides examples of various practical tasks using the Wandas library.

## Basic Audio Analysis

- [Get basic information from audio files](basic_info.md)
- [Analyze the frequency spectrum of audio](frequency_analysis.md)
- [Measure volume characteristics such as RMS level and peak level](level_measurement.md)

## Signal Processing

- [Apply low-pass/high-pass/band-pass filters](filtering.md)
- [Adjust the volume of specific frequency bands (equalizer)](equalization.md)
- [Perform noise reduction](noise_reduction.md)
- [Change the pitch of audio](pitch_shifting.md)

## Audio Data Manipulation

- [Concatenate multiple audio files](concatenation.md)
- [Extract specific parts](trimming.md)
- [Apply fade-in/fade-out to audio](fading.md)
- [Convert between different formats](format_conversion.md)

## Special Effects

- [Add reverb effects](reverb.md)
- [Add echo effects](echo.md)
- [Apply distortion effects](distortion.md)

## Advanced Applications

- [Use as preprocessing for speech recognition](speech_preprocessing.md)
- [Efficiently process large datasets](batch_processing.md)
- [Build real-time processing pipelines](realtime_processing.md)

## Adding Custom Processing

- [Define your own filters](custom_filters.md)
- [Implement new processing functions](custom_processors.md)
- [Integrate wandas with other libraries](third_party_integration.md)
