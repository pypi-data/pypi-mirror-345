# HtmlEval Documentation

**HtmlEval** is a framework for constructing **evaluation surveys** with reusable, structured **blocks**.  
It enables the creation of **simple and complex survey layouts**, allowing users to:

- **Evaluate text**
- **Categorize content**
- **Interact with structured data**

## Overview

This documentation explains how to:

- **Build surveys using simple blocks** (text, checkboxes, selection questions).
- **Combine blocks into compound layouts** (columns, tabs, interactive fragments).
- **Generate and customize survey examples**.

## Getting Started

To generate a survey, use:

```bash
python ../createDemo.py
```

## For more:
- **Simple Blocks**: Basic building blocks for surveys.
- **Compound Blocks**: Advanced layouts using structured containers.
