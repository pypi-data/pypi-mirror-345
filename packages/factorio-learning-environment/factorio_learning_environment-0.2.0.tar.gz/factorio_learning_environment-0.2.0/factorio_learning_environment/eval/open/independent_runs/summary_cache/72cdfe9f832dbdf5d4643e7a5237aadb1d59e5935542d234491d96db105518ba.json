{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, -60.0) connected to:\n  - **Wooden Chest** at position (4.5, -58.5) for iron ore storage.\n  - Additional **Wooden Chests** at positions (5.5, 6.5, 7.5, 8.5, 9.5, -60.5) for overflow storage.\n- **Iron Chest** at position (-5.5, -50.5) for storing extracted iron ore.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (-15.0, -48.0), (-13.0, -48.0), and (-11.0, -48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-14.5, -13.5, -12.5, -11.5, -10.5, -9.5, -8.5, -7.5, -6.5, -50.5) for storing iron plates, with some chests indicating full status.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Full Chests\n- Ensure that chests used for storing resources are regularly emptied to prevent overflow and halt in production. Consider upgrading to larger storage solutions if necessary.\n\n### Errors with Mining Drill Output\n- The burner mining drill at position (4.0, -60.0) has a warning indicating that the chest at the drop position is full. Ensure the chest is emptied to continue mining operations effectively.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined by the agent in the provided steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `iron_ore_count: int` - Tracks the number of iron ore extracted and stored.\n- `iron_plate_count: int` - Tracks the number of iron plates produced and stored.\n- `coal_count: int` - Tracks the amount of coal harvested and used for fueling furnaces and drills."}
