For example, copper plates are required for crafting copper cables, which are needed for small electric poles.\n\n### Errors in Connecting Electricity and Pipes\n- Verify that all components in the electricity network are properly connected. Ensure that small electric poles are correctly placed and connected to form a complete network.\n- Ensure that pipes are placed in unoccupied tiles and are properly connected to form a continuous flow between components like the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine.\n\n### Errors in Entity Placement\n- Before placing entities such as pipes, verify that the target tile is unoccupied to avoid placement errors. Adjust the position if necessary to find a suitable location.\n\n### Errors in Fuel Management\n- Regularly check and refuel components like boilers to ensure they are operational. Lack of fuel will prevent the boiler from functioning, which in turn affects the entire electricity generation process.\n\n### Code and Logic Errors\n- Review and correct any logic errors in the code, such as index out of range errors, to ensure smooth execution of tasks."}
