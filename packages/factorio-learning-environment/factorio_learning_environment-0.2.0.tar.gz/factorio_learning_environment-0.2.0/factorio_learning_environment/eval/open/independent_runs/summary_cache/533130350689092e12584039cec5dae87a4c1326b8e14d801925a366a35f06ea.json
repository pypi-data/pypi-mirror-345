{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Mining and Smelting Setup at (-28, -61)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (x=-28.0, y=-61.0)\n- Stone furnace (x=-27.0, y=-59.0)\n- Burner inserter (x=-25.5, y=-58.5)\n- Collection chest (x=-24.5, y=-58.5) containing iron and copper plates\n- Additional furnaces at (x=-23.0, y=-58.0) and (x=-21.0, y=-58.0)\n- Output collection chest (x=-22.5, y=-55.5)\n\n### Iron Mining Complex at (-10, -59)\nConsists of three mining drills in sequence:\n- Mining drill 1 (x=-10.0, y=-59.0)\n- Mining drill 2 (x=-8.0, y=-59.0)\n- Mining drill 3 (x=-6.0, y=-59.0)\n- Collection chests at (x=-9.5, y=-57.5), (x=-7.5, y=-57.5), and (x=-5.5, y=-57.5)\n- Multiple burner inserters managing ore movement\n- Transport belt system connecting the mining area\n\n### Iron Smelting Array at (0, 0)\nFour parallel smelting units:\n1. First unit:\n   - Furnace at (x=0.0, y=0.0)\n   - Input chest (x=0.5, y=-2.5)\n   - Output chest (x=0.5, y=2.5)\n   - Burner inserters at (x=0.5, y=-1.5) and (x=0.5, y=1.5)\n\n2. Second unit:\n   - Furnace at (x=2.0, y=0.0)\n   - Input chest (x=2.5, y=-2.5)\n   - Output chest (x=2.5, y=2.5)\n   - Burner inserters at (x=2.5, y=-1.5) and (x=2.5, y=1.5)\n\n3. Third unit:\n   - Furnace at (x=4.0, y=0.0)\n   - Input chest (x=4.5, y=-2.5)\n   - Output chest (x=4.5, y=2.5)\n   - Burner inserters at (x=4.5, y=-1.5) and (x=4.5, y=1.5)\n\n4. Fourth unit:\n   - Furnace at (x=6.0, y=0.0)\n   - Input chest (x=6.5, y=-2.5)\n   - Output chest (x=6.5, y=2.5)\n   - Burner inserters at (x=6.5, y=-1.5) and (x=6.5, y=1.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Errors\n- Check for existing entities before placing new ones at a location\n- Cannot place wooden chests where items are being dropped on ground\n\n### Resource Management Errors\n- Ensure coal is available in inventory before attempting to insert it into machines\n- Keep mining drills and inserters fueled to prevent work stoppage\n\n### Inserter Operation Issues\n- Ensure proper space in destination inventory before inserter operations\n- Check that inserters have valid pickup and drop-off positions\n\n### Belt System Issues\n- Ensure proper connection and flow direction in belt systems\n- Check for blockages in belt transport systems"}
