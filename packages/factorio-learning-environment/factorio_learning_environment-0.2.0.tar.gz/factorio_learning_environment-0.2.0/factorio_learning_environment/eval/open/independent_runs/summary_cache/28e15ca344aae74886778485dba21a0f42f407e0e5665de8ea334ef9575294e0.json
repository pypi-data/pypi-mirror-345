Verify the chest's inventory before attempting to extract.\n\n### Errors with Transferring Iron Ore to Furnaces\n- Make sure that the furnaces have the necessary ingredients to process. Check that the iron ore is available and that the furnaces are not blocked or missing input materials.\n\n### Errors with Full Drop Positions\n- Regularly check and empty the chests at drop positions to prevent mining drills from halting due to full inventories. Ensure there is enough space for mined resources.\n\n### General Extraction Errors\n- Verify the target entity and its contents before attempting extraction. Ensure that the entity is accessible and contains the items you intend to extract."}
