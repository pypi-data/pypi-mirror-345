{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnace 1** at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0) with coal fuel and iron ore input, currently working.\n- **Furnace 2** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0) with coal fuel and iron ore input, currently working.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-47.5) transferring items between furnaces and a wooden chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-13.5, y=-46.5) storing intermediate products.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-11.5, y=-45.5) with blocked output due to lack of destination space, connected to an iron chest.\n- **Iron Chest** at position (x=-11.5, y=-44.5) storing iron plates.\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-7.0, y=23.5)\nConsists of:\n- **Boiler** at position (x=-7.0, y=23.5) with no fuel, connected to a steam engine and offshore pump.\n- **Steam Engine** at position (x=-3.5, y=23.5) generating electricity, connected to the boiler.\n- **Offshore Pump** at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5) supplying water to the boiler.\n\n### Transport Belt Network\nConsists of:\n- **Belt Group** connecting various positions, facilitating the movement of iron plates between furnaces and chests.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Blockage Issues\n- Ensure that inserters have a clear path to transfer items to their destination. If an inserter is blocked, check for available space in the destination entity.\n\n### Extraction Errors from Furnaces\n- Verify that the target furnace contains the items you wish to extract. Attempting to extract items from an empty furnace will result in an error.\n\n### Fuel Management for Boilers\n- Regularly check and replenish fuel in boilers to maintain continuous electricity generation. Lack of fuel will halt the operation of the boiler.\n\n### Inventory Management\n- Ensure sufficient quantities of items, such as coal, are available in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities."}
