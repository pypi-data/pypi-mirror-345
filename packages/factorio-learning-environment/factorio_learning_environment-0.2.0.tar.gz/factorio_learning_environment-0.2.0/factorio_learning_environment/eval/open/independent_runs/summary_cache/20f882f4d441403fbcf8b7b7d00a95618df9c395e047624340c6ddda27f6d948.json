{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=4.5, y=-10.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (x=4.5, y=-10.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine\n- Boiler at Position (x=20.5, y=-4.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (x=22.5, y=-7.5)\n- Small Electric Poles at various positions for power distribution\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility at Position (x=5.0, y=5.0)\nConsists of:\n- Furnace at Position (x=5.0, y=5.0) for smelting copper ore into copper plates\n- Inserters at Positions (x=7.5, y=5.5) and (x=9.5, y=5.5) for moving items\n- Wooden Chest at Position (x=8.5, y=5.5) for storage\n- Transport Belt network connecting the furnace to the assembling machine\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Site at Position (x=-11.0, y=20.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (x=-11.0, y=20.0)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (x=-11.5, y=18.5) for storing mined iron ore\n\n### Copper Cable Factory at Position (x=10.5, y=0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling Machine at Position (x=10.5, y=0.5) for crafting copper cables\n- Small Electric Poles for power distribution\n- Inserters and transport belts for moving items to and from the assembling machine\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors When Inserting Items Without Inventory\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. For example, ensure you have coal before inserting it into a furnace or copper plates before inserting them into an assembling machine.\n\n### Errors When Inserter is Waiting for Source Items\n- Check that the source entity (e.g., chest or belt) has the necessary items for the inserter to pick up. Ensure the supply chain is not interrupted.\n\n### Errors Due to Missing Resources in Assembling Machines\n- Ensure that all required ingredients are available for the assembling machine to function. For example, make sure there are enough copper plates available for copper cable production."}
