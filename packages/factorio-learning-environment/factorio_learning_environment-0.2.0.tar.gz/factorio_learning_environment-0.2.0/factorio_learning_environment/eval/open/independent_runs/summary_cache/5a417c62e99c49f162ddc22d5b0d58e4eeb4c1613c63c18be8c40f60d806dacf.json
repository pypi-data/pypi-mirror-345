Verify and utilize the active, correctly assigned fluid system ID (currently 11116 in the pipeline network) before initiating connection attempts.\n\n\u2022 Redundant Pipeline Stabilization Delays:\n  - Repeated 10-second wait periods following failed connection attempts introduce unnecessary delays. Validate pipeline alignment and operational status early to streamline the process.\n\n\u2022 Persistent Water Supply Connection Failure:\n  - The steam engine remains NOT_CONNECTED due to a failure in establishing a water supply. Reassess the integration between the boiler, offshore pump, and the pipeline network to ensure proper fluid delivery."}
