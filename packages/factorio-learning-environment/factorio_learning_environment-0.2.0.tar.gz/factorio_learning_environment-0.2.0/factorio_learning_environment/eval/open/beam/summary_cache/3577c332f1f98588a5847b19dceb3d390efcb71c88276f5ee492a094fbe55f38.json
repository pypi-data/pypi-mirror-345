{"content": "I understand the error now. The issue is that `get_entities({Prototype.StoneFurnace})` returned an empty list, meaning no furnaces were found, which made `closest_furnace` remain None. Let's modify the code to handle this case:\n\n```python\n# Get the wooden chest and check for furnaces\nchest = get_entities({Prototype.WoodenChest})[0]\nfurnaces = get_entities({Prototype.StoneFurnace})\nprint(f\"Found chest at {chest.position} with contents: {inspect_inventory(chest)}\")\nprint(f\"Number of furnaces found: {len(furnaces)}\")\n\nif not furnaces:\n    # No furnaces found, try to place one\n    print(\"No furnaces found. Attempting to place a new furnace...\")\n    try:\n        new_furnace = place_entity_next_to(\n            Prototype.StoneFurnace,\n            reference_position=chest.position,\n            direction=Direction.RIGHT,\n            spacing=1\n        )\n        print(f\"Successfully placed new furnace at {new_furnace.position}\")\n        furnaces = [new_furnace]\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Failed to place furnace: {e}\")\n        return\n\n# Now we should have at least one furnace\nworking_furnace = furnaces[0]\nprint(f\"Working with furnace at {working_furnace.position}\")\n\n# Check and add fuel if needed\nmove_to(working_furnace.position)\nfurnace_contents = inspect_inventory(working_furnace)\nprint(f\"Furnace contents: {furnace_contents}\")\n\nif not furnace_contents.get('coal', 0):\n    print(\"Adding fuel to furnace...\")\n    insert_item(Prototype.Coal, working_furnace, quantity=5)\n\n# Get ore from chest\nmove_to(chest.position)\niron_ore = extract_item(Prototype.IronOre, chest, quantity=5)\nprint(f\"Extracted ore.

Explicitly checks if any furnaces were found\n2. Attempts to place a new furnace if none exist\n3. Has better error handling and status reporting\n4. Continues with the smelting process only if we have a working furnace\n\nKey learnings from the errors:\n1. Always check if entities exist before trying to access their properties\n2. Provide clear error messages and status updates\n3. Handle the case where required entities might not exist\n4. Use defensive programming when dealing with potentially missing objects\n\nLet me know if you see any other issues or if you need further modifications.", "summary_range": "[1-3650]"}
