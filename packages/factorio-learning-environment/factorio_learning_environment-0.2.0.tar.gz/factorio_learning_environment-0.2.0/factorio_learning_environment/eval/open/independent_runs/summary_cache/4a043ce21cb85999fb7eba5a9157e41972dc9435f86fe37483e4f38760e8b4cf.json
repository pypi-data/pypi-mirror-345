{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report (Updated)\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generation system at x=-25.0 y=80.5\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at x=-20.5 y=69.5 (connected with pipes)\n- Boiler at x=-25.0 y=80.5 (working with coal fuel, fuel level: 8)\n- Missing steam engine at x=-25.5 y=89.5 (previously existed but now missing)\n- Pipe networks:\n  - Water system connecting pump to boiler (functional)\n  - Steam system (status unknown due to missing steam engine)\n\n### Copper mining operation at x=-55.5 y=70.5\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill at x=-55.5 y=70.5 (powered but waiting for space)\n- Burner inserter at x=-55.5 y=72.5 (working, fuel: 9 coal)\n- Stone furnace at x=-55.0 y=75.0 (fuel: 10 coal, no ingredients)\n- Wooden chest at x=-55.5 y=76.5 (empty output storage)\n\n### Iron mining operation at x=15.5 y=70.5\n(No changes from previous report)\nConsists of:\n- Electric mining drill at x=15.5 y=70.5 (currently no power)\n- Stone furnace at x=16.0 y=74.0 (no ingredients)\n- Burner inserter at x=15.5 y=72.5 (working)\n- Wooden chest at x=15.5 y=75.5 (empty output storage)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity management issues\n- Steam engine missing at x=-25.5 y=89.5 (previously existed)\n- Inconsistent entity state tracking (burner inserter appears and disappears at x=-55.5 y=72.5)\n- Implement entity verification before operations (multiple \"no entity found\" errors)\n\n### Power network problems\n- Complete power network connections (missing steam engine affecting whole system)\n- Resolve small electric pole placement issues (8 consecutive failed placement attempts)\n- Verify power pole placement positions (existing objects blocking placement)\n\n### Resource management\n- Monitor coal supplies (boiler fuel running low at 8 units)\n- Implement fuel checks before insertion attempts (failed to insert coal with empty inventory)\n- Clear output blockages (copper drill still waiting for space)\n\n### Production chain monitoring\n- Supply ingredients to furnace (stone furnace at x=-55.0 y=75.0 still has no ingredients)\n- Verify inserter functionality (inserter at x=-55.5 y=72.5 waiting for source items)\n- Monitor production outputs (zero copper plates produced)\n\n### System verification\n- Implement connection status verification (boiler shows working but steam system incomplete)\n- Verify fluid systems (steam system status unknown due to missing engine)\n- Monitor power production and consumption metrics (voltage shows 0)"}
