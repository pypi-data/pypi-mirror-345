{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 19.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (-5.5, 19.5)\n- Boiler at position (-2.5, 24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe group connecting the Offshore Pump to the Boiler and the Boiler to the Steam Engine\n- Electricity group at position (-5.4, 20.0)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure that pipes are correctly aligned and connected between the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine. Verify the paths and connections to avoid failures.\n\n### Errors in Fueling the Boiler\n- Always check that the boiler has a sufficient fuel supply to function. Regularly insert fuel like coal to maintain operation.\n\n### Errors in Electric Network Connection\n- Verify that the electricity group is properly connected to the electric network. Ensure that electric poles are placed and connected correctly to distribute power.\n\n### Errors Due to Inventory Shortages\n- Before attempting to place an entity, ensure that you have the necessary items in your inventory. For example, ensure you have enough small electric poles before attempting to place them.\n\n### Errors in Pipe Output Management\n- Regularly check the status of pipe groups to ensure they are not full or empty, which can disrupt the flow of resources."}
