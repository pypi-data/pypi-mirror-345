{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-13.5, 23.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (-13.5, 23.5) (Status: NOT_CONNECTED)\n- Boiler at position (-10.5, 21.0) (Status: NOT_CONNECTED)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5) (Status: WORKING)\n- Pipe groups connecting various positions, including:\n  - Pipe group at position (-9.5, 23.5) (Status: FULL_OUTPUT)\n  - Pipe groups at positions (-5.5, 16.5), (-7.5, 24.5), (-5.5, 24.5), (-4.5, 16.5), (-4.5, 24.5), (-10.5, 23.5) (Status: EMPTY)\n  - Electricity group at position (-3.67, 20.21) (Status: NOT_PLUGGED_IN_ELECTRIC_NETWORK)\n\n### Stone Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) (Status: NO_INGREDIENTS)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities where space is occupied\n- Ensure the target location is clear of any existing objects or unplaceable terrain before attempting to place an entity. For example, steam engines and pipes could not be placed due to obstructions.\n\n### Errors due to lack of inventory items\n- Verify that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to place them. For instance, attempts to place pipes failed due to a lack of pipes in the inventory.\n\n### Errors in connecting underground pipes\n- Ensure that underground pipes are correctly aligned and connected. Multiple attempts to connect underground pipes failed due to misalignment or incorrect placement.\n\n### Errors due to unconnected structures\n- Check connections between structures, such as steam engines and boilers, to ensure they are properly connected to the network. Many components remain unconnected, preventing the electricity generator from functioning.\n\n### Errors with incorrect API usage\n- Avoid using incorrect function calls or misusing API functions, such as treating 'Position' as callable, which leads to errors in execution."}
