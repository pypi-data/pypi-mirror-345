{"content": "# Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with status WORKING, fueled by coal, smelting iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter 1** at position (x=1.5, y=0.5) transferring iron plates from the furnace to a wooden chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=2.5, y=0.5) storing iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter 2** at position (x=3.5, y=0.5) extracting iron plates from the wooden chest and placing them onto a transport belt.\n- **Transport Belt** connecting positions (x=3.5, y=0.5) to (x=6.5, y=0.5) carrying iron plates towards the end chest.\n- **Burner Inserter 3** at position (x=6.5, y=0.5) transferring iron plates from the transport belt to the end wooden chest.\n- **End Wooden Chest** at position (x=7.5, y=0.5) collecting iron plates from the transport belt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Ensure that the target tile is unoccupied before attempting to place a new entity. Consider increasing spacing, changing direction, or adjusting the reference position if placement fails due to an existing entity.\n\n### Errors when connecting belts directly from a chest\n- Use an inserter to extract items from a chest before attempting to connect them to a transport belt. Belts cannot be directly connected to chests.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient inventory items\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to place or craft entities. For example, ensure you have enough wooden chests or the raw materials needed to craft them.\n\n### Errors in crafting due to missing raw resources\n- Gather necessary raw resources, such as wood, before attempting to craft items that require them. Ensure all sub-ingredients are available for crafting."}
