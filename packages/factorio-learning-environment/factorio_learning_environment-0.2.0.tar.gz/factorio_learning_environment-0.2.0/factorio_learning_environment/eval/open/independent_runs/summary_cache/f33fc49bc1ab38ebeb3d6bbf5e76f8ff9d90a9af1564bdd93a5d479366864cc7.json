{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Electricity Generator at (x=-3.0, y=2.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump (x=-9.5, y=-0.5) [working, connected to water pipe]\n- Boiler (x=-3.0, y=2.5) [fuel: 41 coal, working]\n- Steam engine (x=0.5, y=2.5) [working, producing 13150.0 power]\nConnected by pipes and power poles (fluid system 4954)\n\n#### Oil Processing Facility\n1. Crude Oil Extraction:\n   - Pumpjack (x=17.5, y=40.5) [working, 1600.0 power]\n   - Storage tank (x=4.5, y=15.5) [empty, connection issues]\n\n2. Oil Refinery:\n   - Oil refinery (x=9.5, y=15.5) [FLUID_INGREDIENT_SHORTAGE]\n   - Connected to empty crude oil input (x=6.5, y=16.5)\n   - Petroleum gas output pipe (x=12.5, y=17.5) [empty]\n\n3. Chemical Processing:\n   - Chemical plant (x=2.5, y=8.5) [FLUID_INGREDIENT_SHORTAGE]\n   - Water input connected (60 water)\n   - Petroleum gas input unconnected (x=1.0, y=7.5)\n   - Sulfur output tank (x=6.5, y=8.5) [empty]\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Persistent Pipeline Connection Issues\n- Repeated failures connecting pumpjack (x=17.5,y=40.5) to storage tank (x=4.5,y=15.5)\n  - Verify complete path clearance (current obstruction at x=17.5,y=35.5)\n  - Use underground pipes for vertical segments\n  - Consider building intermediate storage tanks\n\n#### Fluid System Validation\n- Chemical plant shows FLUID_INGREDIENT_SHORTAGE despite water connection\n  - Petroleum gas input remains unconnected (x=1.0,y=7.5)\n  - Verify refinery is producing petroleum gas first\n\n#### API Usage Errors\n- Repeated Prototype.PipeToGround errors (correct: PipeToGround)\n  - Verify exact prototype names in API documentation\n  - Check case sensitivity in all prototype references\n\n#### Power System Maintenance\n- Monitor boiler fuel levels (current: 41 coal)\n- Steam engine connection error (attempting self-connection)\n  - Verify target entities are different from source\n\n#### Pipeline Construction Strategy\n1. Build in smaller verified segments\n2. Test each connection point individually\n3. Use underground pipes for cleaner layouts\n4. Verify fluid flow direction matches connection points\n\n#### Successful Fixes\n- Boiler refueled (now 41 coal)\n- Steam engine restored (13150.0 power)\n- Pumpjack operational (1600.0 power)\n\n#### General Fluid System Tips\n1. Verify fluid production at source first\n2. Check all intermediate storage levels\n3. Validate pipe connections end-to-end\n4. Monitor entity status indicators continuously\n5. Clear obstructions before connection attempts\n\n#### New Errors\n- Storage tank placement error (x=17.5,y=25.5)\n  - Ensure correct parameter types when placing entities (Position vs Direction)\n- Repeated pumpjack connection failures (x=17.5,y=40.5 to x=25.5,y=40.5)\n  - Verify path is clear and entities are within maximum connection distance\n  - Consider adding intermediate pumps for long pipelines"}
