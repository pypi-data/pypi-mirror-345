{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line at (-2.0, -76.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (x=-2.0, y=-76.0) connected to\n- Stone furnace (x=-1.0, y=-74.0)\n- Burner inserter (x=0.5, y=-74.5) moving items to\n- Iron chest (x=1.5, y=-74.5) containing iron plates\n- Additional iron chest (x=0.5, y=-72.5) with iron plates\n\n### Copper Plate Production Line at (-21.0, -73.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (x=-21.0, y=-73.0) mining copper and iron ore\n- Iron chest (x=-21.5, y=-74.5) storing copper ore\n- Burner inserter (x=-20.5, y=-74.5) moving items to\n- Stone furnace (x=-19.0, y=-74.0) with copper plates\n\n### Iron Plate Processing Line at (3.0, -73.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace (x=3.0, y=-73.0)\n- Stone furnace (x=5.0, y=-73.0)\n- Burner inserter (x=6.5, y=-72.5)\n- Iron chest (x=7.5, y=-72.5) storing iron plates\n- Iron chest (x=3.5, y=-71.5)\n- Burner inserter (x=1.5, y=-72.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Fuel Management Issues\n- Ensure mining drills have fuel before operation (burner mining drill at x=-2.0, y=-76.0 is out of fuel)\n- Monitor fuel levels regularly to maintain continuous operation\n\n### Production Flow Issues\n- Multiple furnaces show \"no ingredients to smelt\" warnings - ensure proper input material flow\n- Some furnaces have \"furnace result is full\" warnings - ensure output is being cleared regularly\n\n### Inserter Configuration\n- Verify inserter pickup and drop positions align with intended source and destination entities\n- Some inserters are in \"waiting for source items\" state - check if input materials are available and accessible\n\n### Resource Management\n- Several storage chests contain finished products - implement a system to prevent overflow and ensure materials keep flowing"}
