{"content": "I notice the mining drill is still showing NO_FUEL status even after we tried to add fuel. Let's try to fix this by:\n\n1. First getting the specific drill we want (at position -20.0, 22.0)\n2. Moving directly next to it\n3. Adding fuel while we're close\n\n```python\n# First get wood and craft chest as before\nwood_position = nearest(Resource.Wood)\nmove_to(wood_position)\nwood_gathered = harvest_resource(wood_position, quantity=2)\nprint(f\"Harvested {wood_gathered} wood\")\n\n# Craft the chest\ncraft_item(Prototype.WoodenChest)\nprint(\"Crafted wooden chest\")\n\n# Move to chest placement in steps\nmove_to(Position(x=-20.5, y=15.5))  # Intermediate position\nprint(\"Moved to intermediate position\")\n\nmove_to(Position(x=-20.5, y=20.5))\nprint(\"Moved to final position\")\n\n# Place the chest\nchest = place_entity(\n    Prototype.WoodenChest,\n    position=Position(x=-20.5, y=20.5)\n)\nprint(f\"Placed chest at: {chest.position}\")\n\n# Now get the specific drill we want to fuel\ndrills = get_entities({Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill})\ntarget_drill = None\nfor drill in drills:\n    if drill.position.x == -20.0 and drill.position.y == 22.0:\n        target_drill = drill\n        break\n\nif target_drill:\n    # Move right next to the drill\n    move_to(Position(x=-20.0, y=21.0))  # Position just below the drill\n    print(f\"Moved next to drill at position: {target_drill.position}\")\n    \n    # Add fuel to the drill\n    insert_item(Prototype.Coal, target_drill, quantity=5)\n    print(\"Added fuel to drill\")\n    \n    # Verify the drill's status\n    print(f\"Mining drill status: {target_drill.status}\")\n    print(f\"Drill fuel: {target_drill.fuel}\")\n\n# Check final setup\nprint(f\"Chest inventory: {inspect_inventory(chest)}\")\nprint(f\"Current inventory: {inspect_inventory()}\")\n```\n\nThis should help us better understand why the drill isn't accepting fuel and fix the issue.", "summary_range": "[1-2784]"}
