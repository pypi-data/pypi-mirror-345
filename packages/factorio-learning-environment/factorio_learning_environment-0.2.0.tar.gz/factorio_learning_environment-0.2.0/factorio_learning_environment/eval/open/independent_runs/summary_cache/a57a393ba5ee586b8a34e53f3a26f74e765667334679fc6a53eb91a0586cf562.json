Adjust the candidate selection logic to reference current system identifiers.\n\n- Synchronization of Search Parameters and Pipeline Configuration:\n  \u2022 The repeated failure to locate candidate pipe groups suggests a misalignment between the search radius/parameters and the actual positions or updated fluid_system values in the pipeline network.\n  \u2022 Tip: Ensure that search parameters (including radius and position constraints) are consistently updated to reflect changes in fluid system identifiers across the network.\n\n- Consistency in Fluid System Identifiers:\n  \u2022 The expected identifiers (e.g., 97819) differ from those now active in the network (e.g., 98483), causing connection attempts to abort.\n  \u2022 Tip: Maintain consistent fluid_system identifiers across both the connection logic and the pipeline network to prevent mismatches and improve successful connectivity."}
