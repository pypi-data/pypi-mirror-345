{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) with a drop position at (x=-14.5, y=-48.5). This drill is extracting iron ore and dropping it into a chest.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions:\n  - (x=-13.0, y=-48.0) with iron ore input and producing iron plates.\n  - (x=-11.0, y=-48.0) with iron ore input and producing iron plates.\n  - (x=-9.0, y=-48.0) with iron ore input and producing iron plates.\n- **Chests** for storage and transfer:\n  - Iron chests at positions (x=-18.5, y=-48.5), (x=-16.5, y=-48.5), (x=-15.5, y=-48.5), (x=-13.5, y=-49.5), (x=-14.5, y=-47.5).\n  - Wooden chests at positions (x=-14.5, y=-48.5), (x=-12.5, y=-49.5), (x=-9.5, y=-49.5).\n- **Burner Inserters** for transferring materials between entities.\n\n### Coal Storage and Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Chests** for coal storage at positions:\n  - Iron chests at positions (x=41.5, y=-80.5), (x=42.5, y=-80.5), (x=44.5, y=-80.5), (x=45.5, y=-80.5), (x=47.5, y=-80.5), (x=49.5, y=-80.5).\n  - Wooden chest at position (x=41.5, y=-79.5).\n- **Burner Inserters** at positions (x=41.5, y=-78.5), (x=43.5, y=-80.5) for transferring coal between chests.\n\n### Iron Plate and Coal Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0) extracting resources.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=43.0, y=-82.0) for smelting.\n- **Burner Inserters** at positions (x=43.5, y=-80.5) for transferring items between chests and furnaces.\n- **Iron Chests** at positions (x=41.5, y=-80.5), (x=42.5, y=-80.5), (x=44.5, y=-80.5) for storing processed materials.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when extracting but being too far\n- Ensure you are close enough to the target entity before attempting to extract items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Verify that the target tile is unoccupied before placing an entity.\n\n### Errors with chest management\n- Regularly clear chests at drop positions to prevent mining operations from halting due to full chests.\n\n### Errors with inserter fueling\n- Ensure inserters have sufficient fuel to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Errors with furnace operations\n- Ensure furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt to avoid idle time."}
