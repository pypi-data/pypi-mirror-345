{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=27.5, y=-7.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (x=27.5, y=-7.5)\n- Boiler at Position (x=20.5, y=-4.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (x=19.5, y=-1.5)\n- Pipe network connecting these entities\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (x=-11.0, y=20.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at Position (x=-11.5, y=18.5)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (x=20.0, y=20.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at Position (x=19.5, y=18.5)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=2.0, y=0.0)\n\n### Copper Cable Factory\nConsists of:\n- Assembling Machine at Position (x=10.5, y=0.5)\n- Inserters and Small Electric Poles connecting to the Assembling Machine\n- BeltGroup connecting the Stone Furnace at Position (x=2.0, y=0.0) to the Assembling Machine at Position (x=10.5, y=0.5)\n\n### Miscellaneous Entities\n- Wooden Chests at various positions storing resources\n- Inserters at various positions with no power\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Undefined Variable Errors\n- Ensure all variables are defined before using them. For instance, 'input_inserter_position' was not defined. Double-check variable names and ensure they are initialized correctly.\n\n### Placement Errors\n- When placing entities, ensure there is a suitable position available. If no suitable position is found, consider rearranging nearby entities to create space.\n\n### Power Connectivity Issues\n- Ensure all electrical entities are properly connected to a power source. Many entities, such as inserters and assembling machines, are not receiving electricity. Check connections and ensure power poles are correctly placed to provide coverage.\n\n### Resource Shortages\n- Ensure that all production facilities have the necessary resources. For example, the Assembling Machine cannot create copper cables due to missing copper plates. Regularly check resource supply lines and inventories to prevent shortages.\n\n### Fuel Shortages\n- Ensure that all fuel-powered entities, such as boilers and furnaces, are adequately fueled to maintain operation. Regularly check and replenish fuel supplies as needed."}
