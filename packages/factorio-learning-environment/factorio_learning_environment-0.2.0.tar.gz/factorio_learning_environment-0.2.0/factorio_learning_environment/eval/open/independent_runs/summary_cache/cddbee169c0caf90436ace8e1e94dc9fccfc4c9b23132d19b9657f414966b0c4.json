Ensure that there are enough iron-plates available in the furnace before attempting to craft iron-gear-wheels. The recipe requires 2 iron-plates for each iron-gear-wheel.\n\n### Errors when using furnaces\n- Warnings indicate that the furnace has no ingredients to smelt. Ensure that iron-ore is available in the furnace before attempting to smelt iron-plates. Check the inventory of the furnace regularly.\n\n### Errors when inserting items\n- Insertion of iron-ore fails due to insufficient quantity in the agent's inventory. Always verify the available quantity of items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into the furnace.\n\n### Errors when the furnace output is full\n- The furnace output is full, which prevents further smelting. Clear the output inventory of the furnace to allow for new smelting operations."}
