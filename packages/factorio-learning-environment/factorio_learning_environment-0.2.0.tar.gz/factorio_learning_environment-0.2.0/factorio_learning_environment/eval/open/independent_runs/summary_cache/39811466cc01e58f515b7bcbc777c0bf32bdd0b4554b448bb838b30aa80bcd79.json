{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-16.5, y=-52.5) for storing extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0) for extracting iron ore. It is connected to the wooden chest and a stone furnace. The drill is currently operational but has a warning indicating that the chest at the drop position is full.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates. The furnace is fueled with coal but currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing Burner Inserter\n- Ensure the desired location for placing a Burner Inserter is unoccupied and suitable for placement. Adjust the position accordingly if placement fails.\n\n### NameError: Undefined 'chest_inserter'\n- Verify that the variable 'chest_inserter' is defined before using it. Consider using the correct variable names such as 'chest_inserter_pos' or 'chest_inventory' if applicable.\n\n### Errors when connecting entities directly\n- Avoid attempting to connect belts directly from a chest. Use an inserter to transfer items from a chest to other entities like belts.\n\n### Insufficient Resources for Insertion\n- Ensure that there are enough resources in your inventory before attempting to insert items into entities like mining drills."}
