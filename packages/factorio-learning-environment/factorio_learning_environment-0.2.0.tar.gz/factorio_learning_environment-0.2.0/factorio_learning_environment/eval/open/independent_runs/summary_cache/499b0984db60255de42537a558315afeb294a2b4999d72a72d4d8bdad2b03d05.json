{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Boiler and Offshore Pump Setup at Position (-10.5, 21.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Boiler at position (-10.5, 21.0) with status EntityStatus.WORKING\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, 24.5) with status EntityStatus.WORKING\n- Pipe-group at position (-12.5, 21.5) with status EntityStatus.WORKING\n\nThis setup is responsible for supplying water to the boiler, which is essential for steam production.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing structures in obstructed positions\n- Ensure that the target location for placing entities such as steam engines, boilers, and electric poles is free from obstructions before attempting to place them.\n\n### Errors when connecting electric poles\n- Verify that electric poles are placed correctly and are within range to connect to each other to avoid connection issues.\n\n### Errors with entity status and connections\n- Check that all necessary connections are made, such as connecting the offshore pump to the boiler, to ensure that entities are in a working state.\n\n### Incorrect usage of the pickup_entity function\n- When using the pickup_entity function, ensure that if the first argument is an Entity object, the second argument must be None. Conversely, if using a Position object, ensure the second argument is a Position object."}
