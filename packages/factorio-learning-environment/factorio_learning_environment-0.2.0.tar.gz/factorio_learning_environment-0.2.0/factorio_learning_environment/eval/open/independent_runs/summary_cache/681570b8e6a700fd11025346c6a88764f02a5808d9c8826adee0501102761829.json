{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n###Iron Smelting Setup at y=0\nConsists of two stone furnaces:\n- Stone furnace at position (0, 0) - Currently idle, no ingredients but has coal fuel and 6 iron plates in output\n- Stone furnace at position (4, 0) - Currently idle, no ingredients but has coal fuel and 11 iron plates in output\n\n###Coal Mining Setup at y=-86\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at position (40, -86) - Operational with coal fuel, currently working\n- Iron chest at position (40.5, -84.5) - Collecting coal directly from drill, contains 18 coal\n- Transport belt system:\n  * Belt group connecting drill output to chest position\n  * Belt running from (42.5, -84.5) to (40.5, -84.5)\n  * Belt group running from (38.5, -83.5) to (41.5, -83.5)\n\n###Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Complex at y=-73\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at position (0, -75) - Currently out of fuel\n- Burner mining drill at position (-2, -73) - Operational with coal fuel, output blocked\n- Stone furnace at position (1.0, -73.0) - Has coal fuel and 6 iron plates, no ingredients\n- Stone furnace at position (-1.0, -71.0) - Working with coal fuel, contains 13 iron plates\n\nERROR TIPS\n### Errors when trying to place entities without having them in inventory\n- Before attempting to place entities (like burner mining drills), ensure you have crafted or obtained the required entity first\n- Check inventory contents before placement attempts to avoid placement failures\n\n### Errors when trying to insert fuel without having it\n- Ensure you have the required fuel type in your inventory before attempting to fuel entities\n- Collect necessary fuel (like coal) from storage or mining operations before attempting to power entities\n- Plan fuel collection routes to maintain efficient operations\n\n### Errors when trying to place entities in occupied spaces\n- Before placing entities, check if the target position is already occupied\n- If a furnace or other entity already exists at the target position, either use the existing entity or remove it first\n- Double-check coordinates before placement to avoid conflicts with existing structures\n\n### Errors when trying to craft items requiring sub-ingredients\n- When crafting complex items like burner mining drills, ensure all sub-ingredients are either in inventory or can be crafted directly\n- For items requiring smelted materials (like iron plates), these must be obtained from furnaces rather than trying to craft them directly\n- Plan the crafting sequence to first obtain base materials before attempting to craft more complex items\n\n### Errors related to entity output blockage\n- When placing collecting entities (like furnaces), ensure they are placed exactly at the drill's drop position\n- The position difference of 0.5 in both X and Y coordinates can cause output blockage\n- For optimal placement, use the exact drop position coordinates provided by the drill\n\n### Errors with incorrect entity placement positions\n- Place entities exactly at the designated drop positions when connecting to other entities\n- For furnaces collecting from mining drills, ensure they are placed precisely at the drill's drop position (like at x=-1.5, y=-71.5)\n- When placement fails, check for any items on ground or other obstacles that might be blocking the position\n\n### Errors with inserter placement and operation\n- Ensure there is enough space around the inserter for both pickup and drop positions\n- Check that the inserter's rotation allows it to reach both source and destination entities\n- Make sure to fuel inserters before expecting them to operate"}
