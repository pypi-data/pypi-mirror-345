{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nCurrently, there are no structures on the map. All attempts to place entities have failed, resulting in an empty map with no active entities or structures.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure that the target tile is free of any obstructions before attempting to place an entity. The agent repeatedly attempted to place entities such as Wooden Chests, Burner Inserters, and Stone Furnaces at various positions, but all attempts failed.\n  \n### Errors due to incorrect data types\n- When handling data, ensure that indices are integers where required. The error \"Cannot move. string indices must be integers, not 'str'\" suggests that there was an attempt to use a string index where an integer was expected.\n\n### Errors related to global constraints\n- Check for any global constraints or settings that might be affecting entity placement. The logs indicate checks for global constraints, but no successful placements were made, suggesting potential restrictions or overlooked settings.\n\n### Errors when identifying buildable areas\n- Verify the identified buildable areas for any hidden constraints or issues that might prevent placement. Although buildable areas were identified, placement attempts within these areas still failed."}
