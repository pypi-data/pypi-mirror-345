object exists before attempting to access its attributes.\n- Check if the object is of the correct type before accessing its attributes.\n\n### Errors when connecting entities with pipes\n- Ensure that there is a valid connection point between the entities being connected.\n- Verify that the entities are positioned correctly to allow for a pipe connection.\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied positions\n- Check if the target position is occupied by another entity before attempting to place a new entity.\n- Consider increasing the spacing or changing the direction of placement.\n\n### Errors when connecting non-existent entities\n- Verify that all entities involved in a connection exist before attempting to connect them.\n\n### Errors when entities are not connected to the power network\n- Ensure that entities requiring power are connected to a power source and the power network is properly configured.\n\n### Errors when attempting to place pipes at occupied positions\n- Check if the target position is occupied by another entity before attempting to place a pipe.\n\n### Errors when furnace is not powered\n- Ensure that the furnace is connected to a power source before attempting to use it.\n\n### Errors when entities are not receiving fluid\n- Verify that the fluid source is correctly connected to the entity requiring the fluid.\n\n### Errors when entities are not connected to the electricity network\n- Ensure that entities requiring electricity are connected to the electricity network.\n\n### Errors when trying to get a non-existent entity\n- Verify that an entity exists at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it.\n\n### Errors when placing an entity without having it in the inventory\n- Make sure to check if the entity to be placed is available in the inventory before attempting to place it.\n\n### Errors when crafting without required sub-ingredients\n- Ensure that all required sub-ingredients are available and can be crafted before attempting to craft a product.\n- Check if the required crafting machine or furnace is available for the recipe.\n\n### Errors due to undefined variables\n- Ensure that all variables are defined before using them in the code.\n\n### Errors when output inserter is not found\n- Ensure that the output inserter is correctly placed and configured before attempting to use it.\n\n### Errors when crafting steam-engine without iron-plate\n- Ensure that iron-plate is available or can be crafted before attempting to craft steam-engine.\n\n### Errors when inserting incorrect items into the furnace\n- Ensure that the correct type of item is being inserted into the furnace based on its current contents.\n\n### Errors when crafting items that require raw resources\n- Ensure that raw resources are gathered before attempting to craft items that require them.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into a full furnace\n- Check the furnace's inventory before attempting to insert items.\n\n### Errors when attempting to craft items without the required crafting machine\n- Ensure that the required crafting machine is available and functioning before attempting to craft the item.\n\n### Errors when furnace inventory is full\n- Check the furnace's inventory before attempting to insert items and ensure that it is not full.\n\n### Errors when placing pipe-to-ground at an occupied position\n- Ensure that the target position is not occupied by another entity before attempting to place a pipe-to-ground.\n\n### Errors when placing steam-engine at an invalid position\n- Verify that the target position is valid for placing a steam-engine, avoiding water or other unplaceable terrain.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into a furnace that already contains different items\n- Ensure that the furnace is empty or contains the same type of item before attempting to insert new items.\n\n### Errors when using undefined functions\n- Ensure that all functions are defined before using them in the code.\n\n### Errors when extracting items from an entity that does not contain the item\n- Verify that the entity contains the item before attempting to extract it.\n\n### Errors when 'PipeGroup' object has no attribute 'fluid"}
