{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production at (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-15.0, -50.0) mining iron ore\n- Stone furnace at (-14.0, -48.0) for smelting iron plates\n\n### Copper Plate Production at (4.0, 4.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace at (4.0, 4.0) for smelting copper plates\n- Stone furnace at (6.0, 4.0) for smelting copper plates\n\n### Additional Furnaces\n- Stone furnace at (0.0, 0.0)\n- Stone furnace at (2.0, 0.0)\n\n### Power Generation System\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, 24.5) extracting water\n- Boiler at (-2.0, 23.5)\n- Steam engine at (9.5, 19.5)\n- Two pipe networks connecting:\n  - Offshore pump to boiler (fluid system 46)\n  - Boiler to steam engine (fluid system 50)\n- Electric pole network connecting power to structures (id=11, poles at [(5.5,13.5), (9.5,17.5), (2.5,10.5)])\n\n### Research Facility\n- Lab at (0.5, 8.5) researching automation technology\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Errors\n- Ensure required items are in inventory before attempting to place structures (e.g., stone furnace, offshore pump)\n\n### Resource Management Errors\n- Check inventory for required fuel (coal) before attempting to insert into machines\n- Verify ore availability before attempting to insert into furnaces\n\n### Recipe and Crafting Errors\n- Some items (like copper plate, iron plate) cannot be crafted directly and require smelting in a furnace\n- Raw resources like wood must be gathered, they cannot be crafted\n\n### Building Box Error\n- Fix type error when calculating building dimensions by properly accessing prototype attributes\n\n### Connection Errors\n- Ensure required connection items (like pipes) are in inventory before attempting to connect entities\n\n### Power Network Issues\n- Steam engine not working due to missing power network connection and no fluid input\n- Ensure proper connection of power poles to create a complete electrical network\n\n### Machine Operation Issues\n- Mining drill output is blocked - ensure proper placement of output receiving entities\n- Boiler requires fuel to operate\n- Check fluid connections and presence for steam engine operation"}
