{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nCurrently, there are no structures present on the map. All attempts to place entities such as Stone Furnaces, Wooden Chests, and Transport Belts have been unsuccessful due to various errors.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities in non-buildable areas\n- Ensure that the area where you intend to place an entity is buildable. Verify the terrain and any potential obstructions before attempting to place entities like Stone Furnaces or Wooden Chests.\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied positions\n- Before placing an entity, check if the target position is already occupied or restricted. Attempting to place a Wooden Chest or Transport Belt at an occupied position will result in failure.\n\n### Errors due to lack of resources for operation\n- Ensure that necessary resources, such as coal for Stone Furnaces, are available and supplied to the entities to enable their operation. Without these resources, entities cannot function even if placed correctly.\n\n### General placement errors\n- Review the environmental settings and ensure responsiveness before attempting to place entities. This includes checking for global build restrictions and ensuring that the environment is initialized correctly."}
