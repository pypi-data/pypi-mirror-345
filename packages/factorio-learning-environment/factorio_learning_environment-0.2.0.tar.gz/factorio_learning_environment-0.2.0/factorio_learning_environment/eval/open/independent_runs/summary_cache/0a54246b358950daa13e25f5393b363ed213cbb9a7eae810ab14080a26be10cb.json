{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=0.5, y=28.0)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=10.5, y=34.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=0.5, y=28.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-3.5, y=27.5)\n- Connected with a network of pipes and poles to facilitate electricity generation and distribution.\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing Facility at Position (x=40.0, y=-84.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=40.0, y=-84.0) connected to a chest at position (x=40.5, y=-82.5)\n- Wooden Chests at positions (x=40.5, y=-82.5) and (x=41.5, y=-83.5) for coal storage\n- Burner Inserters at positions (x=54.5, y=-83.5) and (x=41.5, y=-80.5) for moving coal\n- BeltGroup connecting various entities for efficient coal transportation\n\n### Laboratory at Position (x=5.5, y=5.5)\nConsists of:\n- Lab connected to the electricity network with poles for research purposes\n\n### Iron and Coal Storage Facility\nConsists of:\n- Iron Chests at positions (x=0.5, y=0.5), (x=1.5, y=0.5), and (x=2.5, y=0.5) for storing coal and iron plates\n\n### Copper Plate Furnace at Position (x=-15.0, y=-49.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-15.0, y=-49.0) for smelting copper ore into copper plates\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing\n\n### Errors in Entity Retrieval\n- Ensure that the entity type and position are correct before attempting to retrieve an entity. For example, the lab retrieval error at position (x=0.5, y=0.5) indicates no lab was found. Verify the entity's existence and position before accessing it."}
