{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nThis facility is designed for the production of iron plates. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0): Used for smelting iron ore into iron plates. It is currently fueled with coal.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-12.5, y=-49.5): Transfers items between entities. It is currently refueled with coal and is waiting for source items.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-11.5, y=-49.5): Used for storing items, currently empty.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Furnace Lacking Ingredients\n- Ensure that the stone furnace has a continuous supply of iron ore to prevent production halts. Regularly check the furnace's inventory and supply it with the necessary ingredients.\n\n### Errors when Inserter is Waiting for Source Items\n- Verify that the inserter has a valid source to pick up items from. Ensure that the source entity (e.g., a chest or a conveyor belt) contains items that the inserter can transfer.\n\nThese tips should help in maintaining a smooth production process and avoiding common pitfalls related to resource management and entity interactions."}
