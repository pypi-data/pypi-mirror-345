{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report (Updated)\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power generation facility at x=-9.5 to x=-2.5\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump (x=-9.5, y=1.5) - operational but not connected\n- Boiler (x=-5.5, y=0.0) - contains 20 coal but not connected\n- Pipe-to-ground connection (x=-6.5, y=-1.5) - disconnected\n- Additional boiler (x=-6.5, y=10.0) - contains 20 coal but not connected\n- Offshore pump (x=-9.5, y=9.5) - not connected\n\n### Oil production facility at x=17.5 to x=37.5\nConsists of:\n- Pumpjack (x=17.5, y=40.5) - operational but no power\n- Oil refinery (x=27.5, y=40.5) - no power\n- Storage tank (x=32.5, y=40.5) - operational\n- Inserter (x=37.5, y=38.5) - misconfigured (drops to ground)\n- Wooden chest with coal (x=37.5, y=37.5) - contains 47 coal\n- Connected pipe networks:\n  - System 7581: petroleum gas transport\n  - System 7582: crude oil transport\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Power system construction failures\n- Repeated placement failures (steps 89-95):\n  - Boiler placement conflicts (x=-5.0, y=0.0)\n  - Steam engine placement on water (x=-4.0, y=10.0)\n  - Missing inventory items when attempting placement\n  - Verify terrain and inventory before placement attempts\n\n### Fluid connection issues\n- Steam engine connection problems (steps 88, 90):\n  - Wrong fluid type in connections\n  - Verify pipe connections match fluid types\n  - Check connection points for all fluid entities\n\n### Inventory management\n- Missing items during placement (steps 93, 95):\n  - No boilers in inventory when attempting placement\n  - No offshore pumps in inventory\n  - Track inventory levels before placement operations\n\n### Entity access errors\n- Missing steam engine (step 94):\n  - Attempted to access non-existent entity\n  - Verify entity exists before interaction\n  - Consider entity destruction/removal scenarios\n\n### Persistent issues from previous report:\n- Power pole placement verification\n- Inserter configuration checks\n- Production chain sequencing\n- Placement distance requirements\n- Fluid system validation\n\n### Recommended actions:\n1. Replenish boiler and offshore pump inventory\n2. Verify clear land for power system placement\n3. Reconnect fluid systems with correct pipe types\n4. Configure inserter to drop into valid container\n5. Restore power to oil production facility"}
