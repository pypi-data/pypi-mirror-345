{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generation System at position (-10.5, 21.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Boiler at position (-10.5, 21.0) with status EntityStatus.WORKING\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, 24.5) with status EntityStatus.WORKING\n- Pipe-group at position (-12.5, 21.5) with status EntityStatus.WORKING\n- Electricity group at position (-3.6666666666666665, 20.214285714285715) with status EntityStatus.NOT_PLUGGED_IN_ELECTRIC_NETWORK\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Stone-furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with status EntityStatus.NO_INGREDIENTS\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities in obstructed positions\n- Ensure there is sufficient space and no obstructions at the desired location before attempting to place entities such as steam engines, boilers, offshore pumps, and electric poles.\n\n### Errors when connecting electric poles\n- Verify that electric poles are placed correctly and within range to connect them successfully. Avoid placing poles in obstructed positions.\n\n### Errors with entity connection and status\n- Ensure all necessary connections are made between entities, such as pipes between offshore pumps and boilers, to maintain the working status of the system.\n- Check that all entities are correctly connected to the electric network to avoid the \"NOT_PLUGGED_IN_ELECTRIC_NETWORK\" status.\n\n### Errors in using the API for entity manipulation\n- When using the `pickup_entity` function, ensure that if the first argument is an Entity object, the second argument must be None. If using a Position object, ensure it is correctly specified."}
