{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Transfer System at Position (-15.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5) storing extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-15.5, -48.5) transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0) intended for smelting iron ore into iron plates, though currently not receiving iron ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Alignment\n- Ensure that the inserter's pickup position aligns with the chest's position to avoid misalignment errors. Verify that the inserter is correctly positioned to pick up items from the chest.\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities\n- Before placing an entity, check for potential collisions with existing entities or unsuitable terrain (e.g., water). Consider adjusting the spacing, direction, or reference position to avoid placement errors.\n\n### Errors with Fueling\n- Ensure that there is sufficient fuel in your inventory before attempting to refuel entities like mining drills or inserters. This prevents errors related to insufficient fuel supply.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Setup\n- Regularly check the setup of inserters to ensure they are correctly configured to transfer items between entities. Misconfigured inserters can lead to production halts, as seen with the furnace not receiving iron ore."}
