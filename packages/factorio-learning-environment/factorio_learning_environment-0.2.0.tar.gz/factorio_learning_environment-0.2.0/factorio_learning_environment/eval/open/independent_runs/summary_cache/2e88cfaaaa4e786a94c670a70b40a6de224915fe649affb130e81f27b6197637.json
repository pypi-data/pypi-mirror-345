{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation Facility (Updated)\n- **Boiler** at (-7.5, -3.0) - Now relocated but still disconnected (status: NOT_CONNECTED, warnings: out of fuel, no input liquid)\n- **Pipe Network** (system 16792):\n  - Pipes at (-9.5, -3.5)\n  - Status: EMPTY (no fluid present)\n- **Offshore Pump** at (-11.5, -3.5) - Still disconnected (status: NOT_CONNECTED)\n\n### New Power Plant (Unchanged)\n- **Boiler** at (35.5, 47.0) - Fueled with coal but no water input\n- **Steam Engine** at (46.5, 40.5) - Connected to power pole but not receiving steam\n\n### Oil Processing Facility (Unchanged)\n- **Pumpjack** at (17.5, 40.5) - Connected to power pole\n- **Oil Refinery** at (24.5, 44.5) - Connected to power pole\n\n### Coal Mining Operation (Unchanged)\n- **Electric Mining Drill** at (34.5, 20.5) - Connected to power pole\n- **Transport Belt System** moving coal (status: WORKING)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Persistent Fluid Connection Issues\n- Failed pipe connections (steps 89-93,95) - Verify clear path between connection points before attempting connections\n- Fluid type mismatches (step 92) - Ensure source and target fluid types match before connecting\n- Blocked placement positions (steps 94-95) - Implement complete obstruction checks before pipe placement\n\n### Entity Interaction Problems\n- Missing entity lookups (step 88) - Always verify entity existence before interaction attempts\n- Connection validation failures - Test each connection point individually before system-wide validation\n\n### Construction Best Practices (Updated)\n1. Verify inventory before all placement operations\n2. Implement complete clearance checks for constructions\n3. Validate power connections immediately after placement\n4. Check fluid system integrity after modifications\n5. Confirm entity positions before interaction\n6. Maintain proximity (<10 tiles) during placement operations\n7. Verify terrain suitability before placement attempts\n8. Test connections incrementally during complex builds\n9. Validate fluid types match before connecting systems\n10. Clear all obstructions along pipe routes before placement\n11. Verify entity persistence before interaction attempts\n12. Check connection point orientations match before connecting"}
