{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (x=53.0, y=-83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=53.0, y=-83.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=52.5, y=-84.5).\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Transport System at Position (x=-23.0, y=-68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-23.0, y=-68.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=-23.5, y=-69.5).\n- Transport Belt network connecting the mining drill to various positions, including (x=-24.5, y=-69.5), (x=-22.5, y=-69.5), (x=-21.5, y=-68.5), and (x=-21.5, y=-69.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-24.5, y=-67.5) for additional storage.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (x=-19.0, y=-65.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-19.0, y=-65.0) with a Burner Inserter at position (x=-20.5, y=-66.5) feeding from a Transport Belt network.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-16.5, y=-64.5) for storing iron plates.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Transport System at Position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=-12.5, y=-54.5).\n- Transport Belt network connecting the mining drill to the chest and other positions, including (x=-14.5, y=-54.5) and (x=-15.5, y=-54.5).\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-54.5) assisting in material transfer.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage Facility at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with a Burner Inserter at position (x=2.5, y=0.5) transferring items between Wooden Chests at positions (x=1.5, y=0.5) and (x=3.5, y=0.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Connecting Entities\n- Ensure that the source and destination positions are valid and within range when attempting to connect entities using transport belts. Verify that both positions are not nil and are correctly defined in the code.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Operations\n- Ensure that inserters have access to source items. Verify that the inserter's pickup position is correctly aligned with the source entity containing items.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Operations\n- Ensure that furnaces have the required ingredients to smelt. Check that the input materials are available and correctly positioned for the furnace to process them."}
