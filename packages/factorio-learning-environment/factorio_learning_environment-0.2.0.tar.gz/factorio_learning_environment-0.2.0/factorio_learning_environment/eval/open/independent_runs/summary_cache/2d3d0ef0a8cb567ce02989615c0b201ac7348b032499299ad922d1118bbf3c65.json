{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Extraction Site at Position (-21.0, -52.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-21.0, -52.0) extracting iron ore.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-10.0, -50.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-9.5, -48.5) positioned to feed the furnace.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -52.5) positioned for item transfer.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-15.5, -53.5) positioned for item transfer.\n- BeltGroup connecting various entities for item transport:\n  - Belt from (x=-16.5, y=-54.5) to (x=-14.5, y=-54.5), direction RIGHT.\n  - Belt from (x=-12.5, y=-54.5) to (x=-10.5, y=-54.5), direction RIGHT.\n  - Belt from (x=-14.5, y=-50.5) to (x=-16.5, y=-50.5), direction LEFT.\n  - Belt from (x=-16.5, y=-55.5) to (x=-14.5, y=-55.5), direction RIGHT.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors with connecting belts directly from a furnace\n- Use an inserter to connect belts from a furnace instead of attempting direct connections.\n\n### Errors with undefined variables\n- Ensure all variables are defined before use. Double-check for typos or missing declarations.\n\n### Errors with finding suitable positions for entities\n- Verify that there is enough space and no obstacles before attempting to place entities like mining drills or chests.\n\n### Errors with insufficient resources or incorrect setup\n- Ensure that all necessary resources are available and correctly positioned to facilitate production processes."}
