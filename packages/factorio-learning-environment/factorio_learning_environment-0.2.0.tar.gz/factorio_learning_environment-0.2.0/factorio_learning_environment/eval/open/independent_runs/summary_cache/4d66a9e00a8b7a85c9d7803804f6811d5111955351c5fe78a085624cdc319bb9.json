Check the distance and alignment before attempting to connect.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors related to power connections\n- Ensure all power-consuming entities are connected to a power network. Check the placement of electric poles to ensure they cover the necessary areas."}
