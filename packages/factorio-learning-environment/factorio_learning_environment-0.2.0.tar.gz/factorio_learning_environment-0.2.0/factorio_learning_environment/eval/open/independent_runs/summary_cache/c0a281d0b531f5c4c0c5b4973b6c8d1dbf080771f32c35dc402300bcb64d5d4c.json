{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0): Actively mining iron ore and transferring it to a nearby chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5): Stores mined iron ore from the burner mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5): Transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the stone furnace. It has been repositioned multiple times to ensure proper alignment.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates. Currently not receiving iron ore due to inserter misalignment issues.\n\n### Coal Refueling Setup\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-1.5, y=0.5): Positioned to refuel entities with coal. Currently waiting for source items.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Alignment Issues\n- Ensure that the inserter's pickup and drop positions are correctly aligned with the source and destination entities. Misalignment can prevent the inserter from functioning properly.\n\n### Inserter Out of Fuel\n- Regularly check and refuel inserters to prevent them from running out of fuel, which can halt operations.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Iron Ore\n- Verify that the inserter transferring iron ore to the furnace is correctly positioned and functioning. Misalignment or lack of source items can prevent the furnace from receiving iron ore.\n\n### No Coal Available for Refueling\n- Maintain a sufficient inventory of coal to ensure that all fuel-dependent entities can be refueled as needed."}
