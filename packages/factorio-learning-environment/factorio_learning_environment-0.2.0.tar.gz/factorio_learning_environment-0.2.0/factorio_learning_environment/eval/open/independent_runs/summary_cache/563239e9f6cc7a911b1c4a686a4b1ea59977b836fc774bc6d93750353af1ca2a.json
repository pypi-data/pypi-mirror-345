{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\nThis structure is responsible for generating power and consists of the following entities:\n- **Steam Engine** at position (x=17.5, y=20.5) which is generating power.\n- **Boiler** at position (x=1.5, y=23.0) which is refueled and working, connected to pipes and generating steam.\n- **Offshore Pump** at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5) which is working and supplying water to the system.\n- **Pipe Group** transporting steam from the boiler to the steam engine, with pipes running from (x=3.5, y=17.5) to (x=10.5, y=21.5).\n- **Pipe Group** transporting water from the offshore pump to the boiler, with pipes running from (x=-9.5, y=23.5) to (x=-0.5, y=23.5).\n- **Electricity Group** with poles at various positions, ensuring the distribution of generated electricity.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Stale Entity Data\n- Avoid relying on stale entity data for decision-making. Ensure that the entity data is up-to-date before performing actions based on it."}
