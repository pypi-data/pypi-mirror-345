{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES  \n\n#### Electricity Generator at position (x=-9.5, y=-0.5)  \n- **Offshore pump** at (x=-9.5, y=-0.5)  \n- **Boiler** at (x=-5.0, y=2.5)  \n- **Steam engine** at (x=0.5, y=6.5)  \n- **Small electric pole** at (x=3.5, y=6.5)  \n- Connected via pipes and power poles to form a functional electricity generation system.  \n\n#### Oil Extraction and Processing Facility at position (x=17.5, y=40.5)  \n- **Pumpjack** at (x=17.5, y=40.5) (producing crude oil)  \n- **Storage tank** at (x=22.5, y=44.5) (holding crude oil)  \n- **Oil refinery** at (x=29.5, y=48.5) (set to basic oil processing, but not operational due to fluid connection issues)  \n- **Petroleum gas storage tank** at (x=35.5, y=49.5) (empty)  \n- **Chemical plant** at (x=41.5, y=52.5) (set to plastic production, but missing coal and petroleum gas)  \n- Connected via pipes and power poles, but fluid connections are not fully functional.  \n\n### ERROR TIPS  \n\n#### Fluid Connection Issues  \n- **Failed to connect storage tank to refinery**  \n  - Ensure pipe continuity between `storage-tank` (x=22.5, y=44.5) and `oil-refinery` (x=29.5, y=48.5).  \n  - Use `pipe-to-ground` for long-distance connections or reposition entities closer.  \n\n#### Entity Placement Errors  \n- **Attempted to place pumpjack where one already exists**  \n  - Remove existing entities before placing new ones at the same position.  \n- **Storage tank placement blocked by terrain/water**  \n  - Check for water or obstacles at the target position (e.g., x=20.5, y=40.5).  \n\n#### Distance Limitations  \n- **Entity placement too far from player**  \n  - Move within 10 tiles of the target position before placing entities (e.g., x=25.0, y=39.0).  \n\n#### Refinery Operational Issues  \n- **Refinery status: `FLUID_INGREDIENT_SHORTAGE`**  \n  - Verify crude oil is reaching the refinery\u2019s input connection (x=30.5, y=51.5).  \n  - Ensure pipes are correctly linked to the refinery\u2019s `input_connection_points`.  \n\n#### Chemical Plant Warnings  \n- **Missing coal and petroleum gas for plastic production**  \n  - Supply coal to the chemical plant\u2019s input inventory.  \n  - Ensure petroleum gas is piped from the refinery to the chemical plant\u2019s input (x=42.5, y=54.0).  \n\n#### Power Management  \n- **Monitor energy levels of critical entities (pumpjack, refinery)**  \n  - Expand power generation if `entity.energy` drops below operational thresholds.  \n\n#### Prototype Naming  \n- Use `Prototype.PumpJack` (capital \"J\") instead of `Prototype.Pumpjack`.  \n\n#### Assertion Errors  \n- Replace `entity.contents` with `entity.fluid_amount` for fluid checks.  \n- Example: `assert storage_tank.fluid_amount > 0, \"No fluid in tank\"`.  \n\n### NAMESPACE  \n*(No new functions defined by the agent in these steps.)*"}
