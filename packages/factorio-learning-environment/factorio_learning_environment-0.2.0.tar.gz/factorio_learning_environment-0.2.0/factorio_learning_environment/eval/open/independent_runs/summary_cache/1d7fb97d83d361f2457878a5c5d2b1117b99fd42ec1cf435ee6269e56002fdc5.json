{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line (Position x=0-2)\nConsists of two stone furnaces working in parallel:\n- Stone furnace 1 at position(0,0) processing iron ore\n- Stone furnace 2 at position(2,0) processing iron ore\n\n### Copper Plate Production (Position x=4, y=4)\n- Stone furnace at position(4,4) processing copper ore\n\n### Electronic Circuit Assembly Line (Position x=6.5-12.5, y=11.5)\nConsists of:\n- Input chest at position(6.5,11.5) storing iron plates\n- Burner inserter at position(7.5,11.5) moving materials from input chest\n- Assembling machine 1 at position(9.5,11.5) crafting electronic circuits\n- Burner inserter at position(11.5,11.5) moving finished products\n- Output chest at position(12.5,11.5) storing electronic circuits\n\n### Power Generation System (Position x=-9.5 to -2.5, y=22.5-26.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position(-9.5,24.5)\n- Water pipe network connecting pump to boiler\n- Boiler at position(-7.0,24.5)\n- Steam pipe network connecting boiler to engine\n- Steam engine at position(-2.5,24.5)\n- Small electric poles distributing power\n\n### Science Pack Processing (Position x=0.5, y=28.5-31.5)\nConsists of:\n- Lab (position implied near y=28.5)\n- Burner inserter at position(0.5,30.5)\n- Input chest at position(0.5,31.5) storing science packs\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Resource Shortage Errors\n- Monitor coal levels in inventory - multiple instances of running out of coal for inserters and furnaces\n- Keep track of iron ore levels - unable to insert iron ore due to empty inventory\n- Ensure continuous supply of raw materials to prevent production stoppages\n\n### Crafting Chain Errors\n- Unable to craft logistic science packs due to missing prerequisites in the production chain\n- Electronic circuit production blocked due to missing copper cables\n- Ensure all components in crafting chains are being produced before attempting to craft higher-tier items\n\n### Production Line Issues\n- Furnace 3 experiencing \"no ingredients to smelt\" warning - ensure consistent material supply\n- Electronic circuit assembler showing ingredient shortage for copper cables - establish reliable copper cable production"}
