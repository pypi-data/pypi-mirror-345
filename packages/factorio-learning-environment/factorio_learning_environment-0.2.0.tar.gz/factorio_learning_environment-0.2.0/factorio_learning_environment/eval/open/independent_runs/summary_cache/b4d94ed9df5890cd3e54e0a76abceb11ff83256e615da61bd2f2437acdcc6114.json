{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (x=53.0, y=-83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=53.0, y=-83.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=52.5, y=-84.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line at Position (x=-20.0, y=-70.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-20.0, y=-70.0) and Stone Furnace at position (x=-18.0, y=-70.0), both with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-23.0, y=-68.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=-23.5, y=-69.5) and a series of Transport Belts leading to a Wooden Chest at position (x=-24.5, y=-67.5).\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-20.5, y=-66.5) waiting for source items, connected to a Transport Belt and Stone Furnace at position (x=-19.0, y=-65.0).\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Transport System at Position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0) with no fuel, connected to a series of Transport Belts leading to a Wooden Chest at position (x=-12.5, y=-54.5).\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-54.5) waiting for source items, connected to the Transport Belts and Wooden Chest.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage Facility at Position (x=-16.5, y=-64.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-16.5, y=-64.5) storing iron plates, connected to a Burner Inserter at position (x=-17.5, y=-64.5) waiting for source items.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with no ingredients to smelt, connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=1.5, y=0.5) storing coal and iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=2.5, y=0.5) waiting for source items, connected to the Wooden Chests.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Transport Belts\n- Ensure that the entities you are trying to connect are within the correct proximity and alignment. Check the positions and directions of transport belts to avoid connection errors.\n\n### Errors with Chest Object Attributes\n- Verify that the objects you are working with have the necessary attributes and methods. For example, ensure that a 'Chest' object has the 'outputs' attribute before attempting to access it.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the inserters have access to the source items they need to operate. Check the supply chain leading to the inserters and ensure that all necessary items are being transported correctly.\n\n### Errors with Asserting Inserter Status\n- Before asserting the status of an inserter, confirm that it has been properly configured and supplied with the necessary items. This will prevent assertion errors related to waiting for source items."}
