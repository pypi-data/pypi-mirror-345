# MIPMLP 
### (Microbiome Preprocessing Machine Learning Pipeline)
MIPMLP is a modular pipeline for preprocessing 16S microbiome feature data (ASVs/OTUs) prior to classification tasks using machine learning.

It is based on the paper:  
*"Microbiome Preprocessing Machine Learning Pipeline", Frontiers in Immunology, 2021* ([link](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2021.677870/full))  

## Background
Raw microbiome data obtained from 16S sequencing (ASVs/OTUs) often requires careful preprocessing before it is suitable for machine learning (ML) classification tasks. MIPMLP (Microbiome Preprocessing Machine Learning Pipeline) was designed to improve ML performance by addressing issues such as sparsity, taxonomic redundancy, and skewed feature distributions. 

#### MIPMLP consists of the following four modular steps:

1. **Taxonomy Grouping**  
   Merge features according to a specified taxonomy level: Order, Family, or Genus.  
   Grouping method options:
   - `sum`: total abundance
   - `mean`: average abundance
   - `sub-PCA`: PCA on each taxonomic group, retaining components explaining ‚â•50% of the variance  

2. **Normalization**  
   Normalize feature counts using:
   - `log`: log10(x + epsilon) ‚Äî recommended
   - `relative`: divide by total sample counts

3. **Standardization (Z-scoring)**  
   Standardize across:
   - Samples (row-wise)
   - Features (column-wise)
   - Both
   - Or skip standardization altogether

4. **Dimensionality Reduction (optional)**  
   Apply PCA or ICA to reduce the number of features.

These steps can be customized via a parameter dictionary as shown below.

## How to Use
### Installation & Setup
```bash
# (optional) create a virtual environment:
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the pipeline
```python
import MIPMLP

# basic usage:
df_processed = MIPMLP.preprocess(df_train)

# full usage:
df_train_processed, df_test_processed = MIPMLP.preprocess(
    df_train,
    tag=tag_df,  # optional
    taxonomy_level=7,   # default: 7, options: 4-8
    taxnomy_group='mean',  # default: "mean", options: "sub PCA", "mean", "sum"
    epsilon=0.00001,   # default: 0.00001, range: 0-1
    normalization='log',  # default: "log", options: "log", "relative"
    z_scoring='No',  # default: "No", options: "row", "col", "both", "No"
    norm_after_rel='No',  # default: "No", options: "No", "z_after_relative" (only used with 'relative')
    pca=(0, 'PCA'),  # default: (0, "PCA"), use (n, "PCA") for dimensionality reduction, -1 for auto
    rare_bacteria_threshold=0.01,   # default: 0.01 (1%), removes bacteria that appear in fewer samples
    plot=False,   # default: False, options: True, False
    df_test=df_test_df,  # optional: test set to be preprocessed with same parameters
    external_sub_pca=sub_pca_model,  # optional: use pre-fitted SubPCA model instead of fitting
    external_pca=pca_model,  # optional: use pre-fitted PCA model instead of fitting
    drop_tax_prefix=True   # default: True, options: True, False
)
```

#### Behavior:
- If `df_test` is provided, the pipeline returns both train and test DataFrames .
- If not, it returns only the processed train DataFrame.
- You may pass a pre-fitted PCA or SubPCA model; otherwise, the pipeline will fit one for you.

### Input Format:  
You can provide:
- **Option 1**: A `.biom` file with raw OTU/ASV counts + a taxonomy `.tsv` file  
- **Option 2**: A merged `.csv` file that includes both features and taxonomy:
  - First column: `"ID"` (sample IDs)  
  - Rows: individual samples  
  - Columns: ASVs/features  
  - Last row: taxonomy info, labeled `"taxonomy"`  

üîó [Download example input file](https://mip-mlp.math.biu.ac.il/download-example-files)

**Optional: Tag File**  
You may also provide a **tag file** (as a DataFrame) containing class labels for each sample.  
This is **not required** for preprocessing, but if present, MIPMLP will generate additional summary statistics relating features to classes.


### Output
The returned value is a preprocessed DataFrame, ready for ML pipelines.  
If both train and test are provided, both are returned.

(‚ö†Ô∏è If `drop_tax_prefix = True` (default), taxonomy prefixes such as k__, p__, g__ will be removed from the feature names. Set this to False if you wish to retain the full taxonomy format in the output table.)


If `plot = True` , a histogram showing the percentage of samples in which each bacterium appears.  
(‚ö†Ô∏è If `pca` is enabled, `plot=True` is not recommended. The visualization will not reflect the original features post-dimensionality reduction.)

## iMic 
 iMic is a  method to combine information from different taxa and improves data representation for machine learning using microbial taxonomy. 
iMic translates the microbiome to images, and convolutional neural networks are then applied to the image.

### micro2matrix
Translates the microbiome values and the cladogram into an image. **micro2matrix** also saves the images that were created in a given folder.
#### Input

-**df** A pandas dataframe which is similar to the MIPMLP preprocessing's input (above).
-**folder** A folder to save the new images at.

#### Parameters
You can determine all the MIPMLP preprocessing parameters too, otherwise it will run with its deafulting parameters (as explained above).

#### How to use
```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv("address/ASVS_file.csv")
folder = "save_img_folder"
MIPMLP.micro2matrix(df, folder)
```
