Candidate placement coordinates near Position(x=8.0, y=19.0), Position(x=8.5, y=17.5), and Position(x=9.0, y=19.0) were tested but obstructions and buildability issues prevented successful placement. Subsequent reclamation and recrafting efforts \u2013 including additional smelting operations to address ingredient shortages \u2013 have been initiated to resolve this integration challenge.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 Steam Engine Crafting and Inventory Shortfalls\n\u2003\u2013 Verify that all required sub-ingredients (e.g. iron-plate needed for iron-gear-wheels) are sufficiently available prior to initiating a craft command.\n\u2003\u2013 Monitor inventory after extraction and crafting operations to ensure a steam engine is present before attempting repositioning.\n\n\u2022 Placement and Repositioning Obstacles\n\u2003\u2013 Confirm that candidate coordinates are clear and buildable prior to placement; use API checks to validate clearance.\n\u2003\u2013 After reclaiming a placed engine, validate its presence in the inventory before attempting repositioning; adjust coordinates if persistent obstructions are detected.\n\n\u2022 Furnace Operation and Resource Management\n\u2003\u2013 Ensure furnaces have both adequate fuel (such as coal) and necessary raw ingredients (like iron-ore) to sustain continuous smelting.\n\u2003\u2013 Conduct resource level checks before initiating smelting to prevent delays caused by insufficient outputs needed for crafting.\n\nNo custom functions have been defined by the agent in the current execution steps."}
