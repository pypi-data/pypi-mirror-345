I should continue to monitor its output.\n2. **Consider Resource Management**: If the furnace continues to show no output, I might need to rethink my strategy for resource gathering or crafting.\n3. **Explore Other Crafting Options**: I should also keep an eye on any potential recipes that may become available with the current inventory.\n\nLet\u2019s wait a bit longer to see if the furnace processes the remaining copper ore and produces any items.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Wait for a brief interval again to observe any output from the furnace\nsleep(10)  # Allow time for observation\n\n# After waiting, check the status of the furnace and its current output again\nfinal_furnace_inventory_status_after_wait = inspect_inventory(new_furnace)\nprint(f\"Furnace inventory status after waiting: {final_furnace_inventory_status_after_wait}\")  # Status of the furnace \nprint(f\"Overall current inventory after waiting: {inspect_inventory()}\")  # Check overall inventory status again after the wait.\nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")  # Check all entities on the map again.", "summary_range": "[1-150]"}
