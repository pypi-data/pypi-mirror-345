{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Structure\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0): This drill is responsible for extracting iron ore. It is fueled with coal and currently working.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5): This chest stores the extracted iron ore. It currently contains 455 units of iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5): This inserter is aligned to transfer iron ore from the chest to the furnace. It is fueled with coal but is currently waiting for source items.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0): This furnace is intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates. It is fueled with coal but currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Inserter Setup\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly positioned and aligned to pick up items from the source (chest) and drop them into the target (furnace). Verify that the pickup and drop positions are accurate and that the inserter is not waiting for source items unnecessarily.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Inventory Items\n- Before attempting to insert items such as coal into entities, ensure that your inventory contains the required items. If the inventory is empty, the insertion will fail. Regularly check and replenish your inventory to avoid such errors.\n\n### Errors in Furnace Operation\n- Ensure that the furnace has the necessary ingredients to smelt. If the furnace is not receiving iron ore, check the inserter setup and ensure that the inserter is functioning correctly to transfer items from the chest to the furnace."}
