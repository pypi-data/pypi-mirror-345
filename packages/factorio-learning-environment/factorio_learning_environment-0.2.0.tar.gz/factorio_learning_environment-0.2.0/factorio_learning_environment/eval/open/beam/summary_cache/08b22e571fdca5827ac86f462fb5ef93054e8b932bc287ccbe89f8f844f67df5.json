This indicates that either the specified location was incorrect or there are no available iron ore resources in the vicinity.\n\n### Current Inventory Overview:\n- 4 pieces of stone furnaces\n- **20 pieces of copper ore** (in inventory)\n- **8 pieces of iron plates** (already obtained)\n- **18 pieces of copper cables**\n- **13 pieces of Iron Gear Wheels**\n\n### Furnace Status:\n- The furnace is not currently processing any iron ore, and I have no iron ore left in my inventory to insert.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Check Nearby Resource Locations**: I need to verify the surrounding area for available iron ore patches to harvest from.\n2. **Use Copper Ore**: Since I have a significant amount of copper ore, I can consider smelting that into copper plates or other components while I search for iron ore.\n3. **Craft Components**: I can also start crafting components that require copper plates or other materials.\n\nLet's first check for nearby iron ore patches before proceeding to use the copper ore.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Check for nearby iron ore patches\nnearby_iron_ore_patches = find_nearby_resources(Resource.IronOre, radius=50)  # Search within a radius of 50 tiles\nprint(f\"Nearby iron ore patches: {nearby_iron_ore_patches}\")  # Output the locations of nearby iron ore patches\n\n# If any patches are found, I will attempt to harvest from the closest one\nif nearby_iron_ore_patches:\n    closest_patch = nearby_iron_ore_patches[0]  # Select the closest patch\n    move_to(closest_patch.bounding_box.center)  # Move to the closest patch\n    harvested_quantity = harvest_resource(closest_patch.bounding_box.center, quantity=10)  # Attempt to harvest\n    print(f\"Harvested {harvested_quantity} iron ore from the closest patch.\")  # Confirm how much was harvested\nelse:\n    print(\"No nearby iron ore patches found.\")  # Notify if no patches are available\n\n# Check the current inventory after the harvesting attempt\nprint(f\"Current overall inventory after harvesting attempt: {inspect_inventory()}\")  # Check overall inventory again\nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")  # Verify entity states.", "summary_range": "[1-240]"}
