{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Storage and Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chests at positions (40.5, -83.5), (41.5, -83.5), and (42.5, -83.5) used for storing coal.\n- Wooden chests at positions (36.0, 0.0) and (38.0, 0.0) for additional coal storage.\n- A burner mining drill at position (41.0, -82.0) extracting coal and transferring it to the chests.\n\n### Iron and Copper Plate Storage\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chests at positions (20.5, 0.5) and (22.5, 0.5) storing iron plates and copper plates respectively.\n\n### Coal Storage\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chests at positions (24.5, 0.5), (26.5, 0.5), (28.5, 0.5), (30.5, 0.5), (32.5, 0.5), (34.5, 0.5), (36.5, 0.5), and (38.5, 0.5) storing coal.\n\n### Copper Plate Processing and Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest at position (7.5, 0.5) storing copper plates.\n- Burner inserters at positions (6.5, 0.5) and (8.5, 0.5) transferring items between chests and belts.\n- A belt group connecting positions (3.5, 0.5) to (5.5, 0.5) and (4.5, 0.5) to (6.5, 0.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Processing and Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) for smelting iron ore.\n- Burner inserter at position (1.5, 0.5) transferring items from the furnace.\n- Wooden chest at position (2.5, 0.5) for storing processed items.\n- Burner inserter at position (3.5, 0.5) transferring items to the belt system.\n\n### Miscellaneous Storage\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chests at positions (10.5, 1.5) and (12.5, 0.5) for miscellaneous storage.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing. Consider removing existing entities or choosing a different location.\n\n### Errors with 'Chest' object not callable\n- Avoid using 'Chest' as a callable object. Ensure that the correct method or function is being used when interacting with chest objects.\n\n### Errors with transferring items from non-existent chests\n- Verify the existence and validity of the chest entity before attempting to transfer items. Ensure the chest contains the items you intend to transfer."}
