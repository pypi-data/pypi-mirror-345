{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Oil Processing Facility (Updated)\n- **Pumpjack** at (17.5, 40.5) - Unpowered with crude oil available\n- **Oil Refinery** at (24.5, 44.5) - Unpowered, configured for basic oil processing\n- **Chemical Plant** at (31.5, 46.5) - Unpowered, requires coal for plastic production\n- Pipe networks:\n  - Crude oil pipes from pumpjack to refinery (system 12891, status: EMPTY)\n  - Petroleum gas pipes from refinery to chemical plant (system 12894, status: EMPTY)\n\n### Coal Mining Operation (Updated)\n- **Electric Mining Drill** at (34.5, 20.5) - Unpowered with coal available\n- **Transport Belt System** moving coal (18 units) towards chemical plant (status: WORKING)\n  - Input belts at (33.5, 22.5) and (34.5, 22.5)\n  - Output belt at (31.5, 21.5)\n\n### Power Generation Facility (Updated)\n- **Offshore Pump** at (-9.5, -0.5) - Newly placed\n- **Boiler** at (-8.5, 0.0) - Connected to water supply but not operational (no fuel/input liquid)\n- Pipe network connecting pump to boiler (system 14015, status: EMPTY)\n- Small electric pole network (status: INCOMPLETE, voltage: 0)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Power System Construction Issues\n- Repeated offshore pump placement failures (49.0,50.0 and 99.0,100.0) - verify water source exists before placement\n- Steam engine placement distance errors (33.5,46.5) - move within 10 tiles before placement attempts\n- Entity collision errors (32.5,46.5) - implement pre-placement clearance checks\n- Boiler connection issues (-8.5,0.0) - verify proper pipe connections and fuel supply\n\n### API Usage Errors\n- PipeGroup length checking error - use correct property access methods\n- Entity retrieval failures (-9.5,-0.5) - verify entity persistence after placement\n- Position validation errors - implement proper error handling for placement operations\n- Electricity network status checks - verify power pole connections\n\n### Construction Best Practices (Updated)\n- Always verify water source before pump placement attempts\n- Implement distance checks before remote placement operations\n- Clear target areas completely before placement attempts\n- Verify entity persistence after placement operations\n- Check fluid system connections after pipe placement\n\n### System Validation (Updated)\n- Implement power plant validation sequence:\n  1. Verify water source\n  2. Check pump placement\n  3. Validate pipe connections\n  4. Confirm boiler fuel supply\n  5. Verify steam engine placement\n\n### Resource Management\n- Coal transport monitoring needed - track belt contents\n- Power plant location planning - prioritize nearby areas\n- Inventory tracking - monitor placed vs available entities"}
