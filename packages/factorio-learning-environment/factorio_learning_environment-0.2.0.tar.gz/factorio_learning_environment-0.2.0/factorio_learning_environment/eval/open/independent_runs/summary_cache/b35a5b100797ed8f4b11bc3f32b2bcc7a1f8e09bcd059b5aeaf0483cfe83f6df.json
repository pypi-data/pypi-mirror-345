{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-23.0, -66.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-25.0, -64.0) connected to a Stone Furnace at position (-23.0, -66.0)\n- Transport Belt connecting the mining drill to the furnace\n- Wooden Chest at position (-24.5, -66.5) storing iron plates\n\n### Coal Mining Setup at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) extracting coal\n- Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5) storing extracted coal\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Setup at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) extracting iron ore\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -54.5) storing extracted iron ore\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) for smelting iron ore\n- Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5) for storing iron plates\n- Burner Inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) transferring items to the chest\n\n### Belt Transport System\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (-25.5, -65.5) to (-23.5, -65.5) for transporting materials\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (-24.5, -64.5) to (-22.5, -64.5) for transporting materials\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (-14.5, -54.5) to (-17.5, -59.5) for transporting materials\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting transport belts\n- Ensure that the entities you are trying to connect are valid and initialized. The error indicates an attempt to access attributes of a 'NoneType' object, suggesting that the target entity may not exist or is not properly referenced.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
