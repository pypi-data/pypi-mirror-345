There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Resources: Iron ore (40,000 units)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)\n  - Status: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Fuel: Coal (14 units)\n  - Furnace result: Iron plate (60 units)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied locations\n- Ensure the target tile is unoccupied before attempting to place entities such as Transport Belts, Burner Inserters, and Wooden Chests.\n\n### Errors when moving entities to invalid positions\n- Verify that the destination position is valid and available for the entity before attempting to move it.\n\n### Errors in entity retrieval\n- Confirm the existence of the entity at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it using the API. This prevents exceptions related to non-existent entities.\n\n### Warnings related to blocked outputs\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity, such as a chest or belt, to accept the output from mining drills to prevent blockage warnings."}
