{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Coal Mining Setup at position (x=41.0, y=-86.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner mining drill** at position (x=41.0, y=-86.0) and a **wooden chest** at position (x=41.5, y=-82.5) to store coal.\n- **Burner mining drill** at position (x=43.0, y=-86.0) and a **wooden chest** at position (x=43.5, y=-84.5) to store coal.\n- **Burner inserter** at position (x=41.5, y=-83.5) to transfer coal from the belt to the chest.\n- **Transport belt** at position (x=41.5, y=-85.5) to (x=41.5, y=-83.5) to move coal from the mining drills to the inserter.\n\n#### Iron Ore Mining Setup at position (x=-17.0, y=-52.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner mining drill** at position (x=-17.0, y=-52.0) and a **wooden chest** at position (x=-16.5, y=-50.5) to store iron ore.\n- **Burner inserter** at position (x=-17.5, y=-50.5) to transfer iron ore from the mining drill to the chest.\n- **Stone furnace** at position (x=-15.0, y=-51.0) for smelting iron ore.\n- **Burner inserter** at position (x=-14.5, y=-52.5) to transfer iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Wooden chest** at position (x=-13.5, y=-51.5) to store smelted iron plates.\n\n#### Smelting Setup at position (x=-13.0, y=-50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone furnace** at position (x=-13.0, y=-50.0) for smelting iron ore.\n- **Burner inserter** at position (x=-11.5, y=-50.5) to transfer iron ore into the furnace.\n- **Burner inserter** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) to transfer smelted iron plates into a **wooden chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5).\n\n---\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when placing entities next to occupied tiles\n- Ensure the target tile is free before placing an entity. If the tile is occupied, increase the spacing, change the direction, or adjust the reference position.\n  - Example: Placing a **wooden chest** or **burner inserter** next to a furnace or another chest.\n\n#### Errors when connecting entities with belts\n- Ensure the belt path is clear and the entities are correctly aligned before attempting to connect them with transport belts.\n  - Example: Failed to connect a **burner inserter** to another inserter due to an occupied tile at position (-13.5, -47.5).\n\n#### Errors when using `get_entity` without a valid position\n- Always provide a valid position when using `get_entity`. Ensure the position is within the map bounds and contains an entity.\n  - Example: Repeated `AssertionError` when calling `get_entity(None, pos)`.\n\n#### Errors when placing entities with insufficient spacing\n- Increase the spacing or change the direction when placing entities to avoid overlapping with existing structures.\n  - Example: Placing a **burner inserter** next to a chest with insufficient spacing.\n\n#### Errors when mining drills run out of fuel or chests are full\n- Regularly check and refuel mining drills and ensure chests are emptied to avoid interruptions in resource collection.\n  - Example: Mining drills at positions (x=41.0, y=-86.0) and (x=-17.0, y=-52.0) stopped due to lack of fuel or full chests."}
