{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Wooden Chest at position (42.5, -81.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest (position (42.5, -81.5)) with an inventory containing 518 coal.\n\n### Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest (position (-14.5, -48.5)) with an empty inventory.\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position (-15.0, -50.0)) currently working with an inventory containing 4 coal.\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position (42.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position (42.0, -83.0)) currently out of fuel.\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace (position (0.0, 0.0)) currently without ingredients, with an inventory containing 100 iron plates.\n\n### Burner Inserter at position (42.5, -80.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Inserter (position (42.5, -80.5)) waiting for source items, with an inventory containing 18 coal.\n\n### Burner Inserter at position (43.5, -81.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Inserter (position (43.5, -81.5)) waiting for space in the destination, with an inventory containing 1 coal.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when extracting coal from the Wooden Chest\n- Ensure that the Wooden Chest contains coal before attempting to extract. The extraction failed because the Wooden Chest at (-14.5, -48.5) was empty.\n\n### Errors when harvesting coal resources\n- Ensure that you are within reach of the coal resource when attempting to harvest. The harvesting failed because there was nothing within reach at the nearest coal position (40.5, -82.5).\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors related to entity statuses\n- Monitor the status of entities such as Burner Mining Drills and Inserters to ensure they have the necessary fuel and space to operate effectively.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `extract_item`: Invoked multiple times with failures due to empty Wooden Chest.\n- `harvest_resource`: Invoked multiple times with failures due to being out of reach of the coal resource.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `extracted_coal`: type `int`\n- `nearest_coal_position`: type `tuple(float, float)`\n- `wooden_chest`: type `Entity`\n- `quantity`: type `int`"}
