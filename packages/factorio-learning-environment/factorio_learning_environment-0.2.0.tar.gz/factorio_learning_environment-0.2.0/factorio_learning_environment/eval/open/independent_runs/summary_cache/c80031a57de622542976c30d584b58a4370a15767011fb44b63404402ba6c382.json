{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=22.5, y=-7.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=22.5, y=-7.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=20.5, y=-4.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=19.5, y=-1.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine\n- Small Electric Poles at positions (x=22.5, y=-4.5), (x=24.5, y=-7.5), and (x=24.5, y=-6.5) for electrical connections\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-11.0, y=20.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=-11.5, y=18.5) for iron ore extraction\n- Stone Furnaces at positions (x=0.0, y=0.0) and (x=2.0, y=0.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=5.0, y=5.0) for smelting copper ore into copper plates\n\n### Copper Cable Factory\nConsists of:\n- Assembling Machine at position (x=10.5, y=0.5) for crafting copper cables\n- Inserters at positions (x=7.5, y=5.5) and (x=9.5, y=5.5) for item movement\n- Belt Group connecting the furnace at position (x=5.0, y=5.0) to the assembling machine at position (x=10.5, y=0.5)\n\n### Transport Belt Network\n- Transport Belt at position (x=9.5, y=6.5) with direction DOWN\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using BeltGroup objects\n- Ensure that the BeltGroup object has the correct attributes before attempting to access them. For example, 'direction' is not a valid attribute for BeltGroup.\n\n### Errors when connecting entities with Small Electric Poles\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to connect entities with Small Electric Poles. Lack of necessary items will result in connection failure.\n\n### Errors due to missing resources in assembling machines\n- Make sure that all required resources are available in the assembling machine's input before starting production. For example, the copper cable recipe requires copper plates.\n\n### Errors when inserters are waiting for source items\n- Check that the source items are available for the inserters to pick up. If not, adjust the supply chain to ensure continuous flow of items."}
