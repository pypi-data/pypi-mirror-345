{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=4.0, y=-60.0) with a drop position at (x=4.5, y=-58.5). \n- Wooden Chest at position (x=4.5, y=-58.5) containing 486 iron ore.\n- Multiple Wooden Chests for storage at positions (x=5.5, y=-60.5), (x=7.5, y=-60.5), (x=6.5, y=-60.5), (x=9.5, y=-60.5), and (x=8.5, y=-60.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Iron Chest at position (x=-5.5, y=-50.5) containing 216 iron ore and 1400 iron plates.\n- Multiple Wooden Chests for storage at positions (x=-14.5, y=-50.5), (x=-13.5, y=-50.5), (x=-12.5, y=-50.5), (x=-11.5, y=-50.5), (x=-10.5, y=-50.5), (x=-9.5, y=-50.5), (x=-8.5, y=-50.5), (x=-7.5, y=-50.5), and (x=-6.5, y=-50.5).\n\n### Iron Smelting Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-15.0, y=-48.0) with a warning of no ingredients to smelt.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-13.0, y=-48.0) with a warning of no ingredients to smelt.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-11.0, y=-48.0) with a warning of no ingredients to smelt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when extracting iron ore\n- Ensure that the iron chest has sufficient iron ore available for extraction before attempting to extract.\n- Verify that the extraction function is correctly targeting the iron chest with the available iron ore.\n\n### Warnings for full chests\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are full to prevent interruptions in mining operations.\n- Implement a system to automatically transfer items from full chests to available storage to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Warnings for furnaces with no ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt before operation.\n- Consider implementing a logistics system to automatically supply furnaces with required ingredients.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `extract_item`: Attempts to extract a specified quantity of an item from a target entity. Ensure the target entity has the required quantity available.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `available_iron_ore`: Represents the quantity of iron ore available for extraction.\n- `extracted_iron_ore`: Stores the result of the iron ore extraction operation."}
