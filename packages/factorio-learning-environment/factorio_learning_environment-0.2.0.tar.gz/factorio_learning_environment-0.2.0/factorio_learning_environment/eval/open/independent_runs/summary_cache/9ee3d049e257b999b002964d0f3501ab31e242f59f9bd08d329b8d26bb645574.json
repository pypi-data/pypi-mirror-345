{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) fueled with coal, extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) used to store extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) transferring iron ore from the wooden chest to the stone furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0) intended for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Ensure you are close enough to the target entity, such as a chest, before attempting to extract items to avoid extraction errors.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Verify that the destination tile is unoccupied before placing an entity to prevent placement errors.\n\n### Errors with inserter alignment and setup\n- Regularly check and adjust the alignment of inserters to ensure they are correctly transferring materials between entities, such as from a chest to a furnace.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient resources\n- Ensure that the chest contains sufficient resources before attempting to extract, as extraction requires a non-zero quantity of items.\n\n### Errors due to fuel shortages\n- Monitor the fuel levels of entities like burner inserters and mining drills to prevent interruptions in operation due to fuel shortages.\n\n### Errors due to full storage\n- Regularly empty storage entities like chests to prevent mining drills from halting operations due to full inventory warnings."}
