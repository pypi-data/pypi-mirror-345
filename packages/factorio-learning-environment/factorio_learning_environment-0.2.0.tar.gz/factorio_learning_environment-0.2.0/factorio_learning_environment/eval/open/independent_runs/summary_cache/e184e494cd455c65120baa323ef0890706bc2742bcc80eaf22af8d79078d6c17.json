Stone furnaces require stone, which must be harvested first.\n- Before crafting a burner mining drill, ensure you have sufficient stone to craft a stone furnace.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n -  Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items\n\n### Errors when extracting from a chest\n- The agent attempts to extract iron ore from chests at specific locations, but the chests either don't exist or don't contain iron ore.\n- Before extracting, verify that the target chest exists at the specified coordinates and contains the item you intend to extract.\n\n### Errors when crafting burner mining drill due to missing ingredients\n- The agent attempts to craft burner mining drills but fails because it lacks iron plates.\n- Before crafting a burner mining drill, ensure you have sufficient iron plates.\n\nNAMESPACE\nImportant variables:\n- new_chest: Prototype.WoodenChest\n- chest: Prototype.WoodenChest\n```"}
