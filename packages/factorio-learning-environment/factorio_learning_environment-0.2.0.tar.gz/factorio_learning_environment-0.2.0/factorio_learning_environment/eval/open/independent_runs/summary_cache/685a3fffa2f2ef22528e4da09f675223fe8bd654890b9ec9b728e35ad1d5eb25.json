The agent attempted to inspect chests at positions (2.5, 1.5) and (4.5, 1.5) but encountered errors indicating no entity of type wooden-chest was found at these positions. Verify that the chests are placed successfully before attempting to inspect them.\n- Ensure that variables used for inspecting chests are defined. Errors such as \"name 'first_chest' is not defined\" suggest that the agent should check variable definitions before use.\n\n### Errors when Inspecting Non-existent Entities\n- Before inspecting an entity, confirm its existence at the specified position. The agent encountered multiple errors when trying to inspect wooden chests that were not present at the given positions. Validate the presence of entities to avoid such errors."}
