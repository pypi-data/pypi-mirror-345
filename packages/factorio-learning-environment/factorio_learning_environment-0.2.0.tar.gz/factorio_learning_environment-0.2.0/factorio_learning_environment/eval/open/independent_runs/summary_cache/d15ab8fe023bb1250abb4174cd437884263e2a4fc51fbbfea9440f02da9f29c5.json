{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Mining and Smelting Complex at (-10, -59)\nConsists of three burner mining drills in a row mining iron ore:\n- First drill at (-10, -59) outputting to wooden chest at (-9.5, -57.5)\n- Second drill at (-8, -59) outputting to wooden chest at (-7.5, -57.5)  \n- Third drill at (-6, -59) outputting to stone furnace at (-5, -57)\nAll drills are fueled with coal and working on iron ore patches\n\n### Automated Smelting Line at (0, 0)\nComplex smelting setup consisting of:\n- 4 stone furnaces in a row at positions (0,0), (2,0), (4,0), and (6,0)\n- 4 burner inserters at (0.5,-1.5), (2.5,-1.5), (4.5,-1.5), (6.5,-1.5) feeding coal from input chests\n- 4 wooden chests at (0.5,-2.5), (2.5,-2.5), (4.5,-2.5), (6.5,-2.5) storing coal for the inserters\n- Output collection system:\n  - Burner inserter at (0.5,1.5) moving items to wooden chest at (0.5,2.5)\n  - Storage chests at (2.5,1.5), (4.5,1.5), (6.5,1.5)\n  - Side-loading burner inserter at (7.5,0.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with crafting recipes\n- Cannot craft wooden chests directly from wood - wood is a raw resource that must be gathered first\n- Ensure you have all required raw materials before attempting to craft items\n\n### Issues with mining drill outputs\n- Mining drills need a valid output target (chest or furnace) directly at their drop position\n- Place appropriate output entities before starting drills to prevent blocked outputs\n\n### Furnace efficiency issues \n- Multiple furnaces showing \"no ingredients to smelt\" warnings\n- Ensure proper input feed systems are in place before starting furnace operations"}
