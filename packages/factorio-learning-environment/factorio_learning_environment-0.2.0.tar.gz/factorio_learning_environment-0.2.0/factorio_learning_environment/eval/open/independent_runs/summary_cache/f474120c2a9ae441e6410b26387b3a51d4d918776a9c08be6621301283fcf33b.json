{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (3 units)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Warnings: Output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Drop Position: (x=-16.5, y=-52.5)\n  - Resources: Iron Ore (40,000 units)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (14 units)\n  - Status: No Ingredients\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Furnace Result: Iron Plate (60 units)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied or incorrect positions\n- **Burner Inserter and Wooden Chest Placement Errors**: Ensure that the target position for placing entities like Burner Inserters and Wooden Chests is not already occupied by another entity or item. Verify the availability of space before attempting to place these entities.\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities from incorrect positions\n- **Stone Furnace Retrieval Errors**: When attempting to retrieve or interact with entities like the Stone Furnace, ensure that the specified position is correct and that the entity exists at that position. Double-check the coordinates to avoid exceptions related to missing entities.\n\n### Errors due to blocked outputs\n- **Output Blockage in Mining Drill**: Ensure that there is a sink entity, such as a chest or belt, to accept the output from the mining drill. Clear any items blocking the drill's drop position to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### General Placement and Movement Errors\n- **General Placement Errors**: Before placing any entity, confirm that the location is suitable and does not conflict with existing structures or terrain. This will help avoid errors related to placement restrictions.\n\nBy addressing these errors, the agent can improve efficiency and reduce interruptions in the production process."}
