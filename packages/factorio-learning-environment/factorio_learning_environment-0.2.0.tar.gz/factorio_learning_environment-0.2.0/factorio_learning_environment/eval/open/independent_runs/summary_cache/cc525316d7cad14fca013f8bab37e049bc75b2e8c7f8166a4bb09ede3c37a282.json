{"content": "Here is the updated report based on the execution logs:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing Setup at (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0) mining coal\n- Transport belt group with:\n  - Input belt at (41.5, -80.5) facing right\n  - Output belt at (42.5, -80.5) facing right\n- Stone furnace at (43.0, -82.0)\n- Burner inserter at (43.5, -80.5) configured to move items between belt and furnace\n\nThe structure is set up to mine coal and transport it via belts, with an inserter to move coal between components. The furnace is currently not processing anything but has fuel.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Conflicts\n- Before placing entities, verify the target location is clear of other entities\n- Multiple failed attempts to place inserter due to existing objects in the way at positions (42.5, -81.0), (42.5, -81.5), and (42.5, -80.5)\n\n### Belt Flow Issues  \n- Mining drill shows \"transport belt at drop position is blocked\" warning\n- Need to ensure belts are cleared regularly to maintain flow of materials\n\n### Component Configuration\n- Pay attention to inserter rotation and pickup/drop positions to ensure proper material flow\n- Multiple attempts were needed to get correct inserter orientation\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nFunctions:\n- place_entity() - Places entities on the map\n  Success: When target location is clear\n  Failure: When location is blocked by existing entities\n\nImportant Variables:\n- Mining drill status: EntityStatus.WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION\n- Belt group status: EntityStatus.WORKING \n- Inserter status: EntityStatus.WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS\n- Furnace status: EntityStatus.NO_INGREDIENTS"}
