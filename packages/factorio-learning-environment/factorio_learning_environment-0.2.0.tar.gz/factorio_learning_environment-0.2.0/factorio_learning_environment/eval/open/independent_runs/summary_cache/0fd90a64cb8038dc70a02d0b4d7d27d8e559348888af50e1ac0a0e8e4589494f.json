Candidate placements at coordinates such as (4.5, 23.0), (10.0, 16.0), (6.0, 20.5), (11.0, 22.0) and (8.0, 17.0) were tested but failed due to placement constraints. In addition, an attempt to connect the existing Steam Engine at (11.5, 20.5) to the Boiler using pipes failed because of connection/obstruction issues, and a placement attempt via a nearest\u2010buildable area (targeting (13.0, 14.0)) was aborted due to the absence of a steam engine item in inventory.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 Candidate Placement Verification:\n\u2003\u2013 Repeated \u201ccan_place_entity returned False\u201d errors occurred for multiple candidate coordinates (e.g. (4.5, 23.0), (10.0, 16.0), (6.0, 20.5), (11.0, 22.0), (8.0, 17.0)).\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Tip: Prior to placement, verify that candidate coordinates fall within a confirmed buildable area. Adjust BuildingBox dimensions, offsets, and environmental clearances as necessary.\n\n\u2022 Pipe Connection Alignment:\n\u2003\u2013 The attempt to connect the Boiler at (8.0, 20.5) with the Steam Engine at (11.5, 20.5) failed with an error indicating obstruction or misalignment.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Tip: Reassess the alignment of connection points and ensure that intervening obstacles are cleared. Confirm that endpoints for pipe connections are correctly positioned for successful integration.\n\n\u2022 Inventory Verification:\n\u2003\u2013 A steam engine placement attempt was aborted with an error stating \u201cNo steam_engine in inventory.\u201d\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Tip: Validate inventory contents before executing placement actions to ensure that required items are available.\n\n\u2022 Consolidated Pre-Placement Checks:\n\u2003\u2013 Multiple placement errors suggest insufficient pre-action verification.\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Tip: Use available API functions (such as can_place_entity and nearest_buildable) to confirm both viability and accessibility of candidate positions, and review environmental conditions to avoid recurrent placement failures."}
