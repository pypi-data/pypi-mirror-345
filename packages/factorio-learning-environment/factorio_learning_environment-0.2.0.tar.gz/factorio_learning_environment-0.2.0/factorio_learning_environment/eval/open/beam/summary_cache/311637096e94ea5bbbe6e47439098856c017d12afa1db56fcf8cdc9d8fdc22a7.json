{"content": "It appears that the diagnostic script is executing without any visible output between the start and end messages. This suggests that the expected diagnostic information is not being printed, possibly due to the following reasons:\n\n1. **Silent Failures**: The script might be encountering an error or condition that causes it to skip over the print statements without raising an exception. This could happen if the entity lists are empty or if the connections fail silently.\n\n2. **Entity Retrieval**: If the entities are not being retrieved correctly, the script would not proceed to the diagnostic checks. Ensure that the entities are present in the game world and that the `get_entities` function is working as expected.\n\n3. **Print Statements**: Double-check that all print statements are correctly placed and that they are not being skipped due to logic errors (e.g., conditions that are not met).\n\n4. **Exception Handling**: If an exception is raised and caught, it might not be providing enough information. Consider adding more detailed exception handling to capture and print any unexpected issues.\n\nTo troubleshoot and resolve this, consider the following steps:\n\n- **Verify Entity Presence**: Manually check in the game environment that all required entities (offshore pump, boiler, steam engine, electric pole, assembling machine) are present and correctly placed.\n\n- **Add Debugging Prints**: Add additional print statements at key points in the code to verify that each section is being executed. For example, print a message after each entity retrieval and connection attempt.\n\n- **Check for Silent Errors**: Ensure that any potential errors in retrieving entities or making connections are logged. You can add checks to confirm that each entity list is not empty before proceeding.\n\n- **Detailed Exception Handling**: Modify the exception handling to include more specific information about what might be going wrong. For example, print the exception message and type.\n\nHere's a revised version of the script with additional debugging output:\n\n```python\nprint(\"Begin System Diagnostics\")\n\ntry:\n    # Attempt to retrieve essential entities and print their count\n    print(\"Retrieving entities...\")\n    offshore_pump_list = get_entities({Prototype.OffshorePump})\n    boiler_list = get_entities({Prototype.Boiler})\n    steam_engine_list = get_entities({Prototype.SteamEngine})\n    electric_pole_list = get_entities({Prototype.SmallElectricPole})\n    assembling_machine_list = get_entities({Prototype.AssemblingMachine1})\n\n    # Output found entity counts\n    print(f\"Offshore Pumps Found: {len(offshore_pump_list)}\")\n    print(f\"Boilers Found: {len(boiler_list)}\")\n    print(f\"Steam Engines Found: {len(steam_engine_list)}\")\n    print(f\"Electric Poles Found: {len(electric_pole_list)}\")\n    print(f\"Assembling Machines Found: {len(assembling_machine_list)}\")\n\n    # Assert presence of all required entities\n    if not offshore_pump_list:\n        raise Exception(\"Offshore Pump not found!\")\n    if not boiler_list:\n        raise Exception(\"Boiler not found!\")\n    if not steam_engine_list:\n        raise Exception(\"Steam Engine not found!\")\n    if not electric_pole_list:\n        raise Exception(\"Electric Pole not found!\")\n    if not assembling_machine_list:\n        raise Exception(\"Assembling Machine not found!\")\n\n    print(\"All necessary entities are present.\")\n\n    # Assign variables for operations\n    offshore_pump = offshore_pump_list[0]\n    boiler = boiler_list[0]\n    steam_engine = steam_engine_list[0]\n    electric_pole = electric_pole_list[0]\n    assembling_machine = assembling_machine_list[0]\n\n    print(\"Entities successfully assigned.\")\n\n    # Move to the boiler position\n    print(\"Moving to Boiler position...\")\n    move_to(boiler.position)\n\n    # Check and refuel boiler if necessary\n    print(\"Inspecting and refueling Boiler if required...\")\n    current_coal = inspect_inventory(boiler).get(Prototype.Coal, 0)\n    print(f\"Boiler Coal Level Before: {current_coal}\")\n    if current_coal < 5:\n        insert_item(Prototype.Coal, boiler, 10 - current_coal)\n        new_coal_level = inspect_inventory(boiler).get(Prototype.Coal, 0)\n        print(f\"Boiler Refueled.
