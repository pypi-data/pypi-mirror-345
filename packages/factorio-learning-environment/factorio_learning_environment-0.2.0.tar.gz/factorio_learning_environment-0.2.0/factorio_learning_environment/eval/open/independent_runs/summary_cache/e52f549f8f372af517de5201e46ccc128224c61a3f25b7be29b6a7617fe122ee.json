{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0) with coal as fuel, currently working but has a warning: \"output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\"\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0) with coal as fuel, currently not working due to \"no ingredients to smelt.\"\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied or invalid locations\n- Ensure the target tile is unoccupied and valid before attempting to place an entity. This includes checking for existing entities or items on the ground that might block placement.\n\n### Errors due to undefined variables in scripts\n- Ensure all variables are defined before use. For instance, the error \"NameError: name 'ore_furnace' is not defined\" suggests a missing definition. Double-check variable names and ensure they are initialized.\n\n### Errors when inserting items from inventory\n- Verify that the required items are available in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities. The error \"Could not insert: No coal to insert from your inventory\" indicates a lack of coal available for insertion.\n\n### Warnings about blocked output\n- Address warnings such as \"output blocked by item on the ground\" by ensuring there is a sink entity (e.g., a chest or conveyor belt) to receive the output from drills or furnaces.\n\n### Warnings about missing ingredients\n- Ensure that all necessary ingredients are available for production processes. The warning \"no ingredients to smelt\" indicates that the furnace lacks the required input materials."}
