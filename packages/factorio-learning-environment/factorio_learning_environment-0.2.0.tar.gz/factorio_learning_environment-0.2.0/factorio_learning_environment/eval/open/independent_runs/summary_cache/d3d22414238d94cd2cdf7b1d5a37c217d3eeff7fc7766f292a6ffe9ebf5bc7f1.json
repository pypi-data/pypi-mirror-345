{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-15.5, -48.5) and (-14.5, -48.5) for temporary storage of extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5) transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0) processing iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-14.5, -47.5) transferring iron ore from the chest to another storage chest at position (-14.5, -46.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Storage\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-6.5, -48.5), (-7.5, -48.5), (-5.5, -48.5), and (-6.5, -49.5) storing iron plates.\n\n### Additional Iron Ore Storage\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -46.5) storing additional iron ore.\n\n### Secondary Furnace Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-10.0, -48.0) processing iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-8.5, -47.5) transferring iron ore from storage to the furnace.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source items are available for the inserters to transfer. Regularly check the inventory of the source entities to prevent bottlenecks.\n\n### No Ingredients to Smelt in Furnace\n- Ensure that the furnaces have a consistent supply of raw materials to maintain continuous production. Regularly check and refill the input inventory of the furnaces.\n\n### Errors When Inserting Items Without Inventory\n- Before attempting to insert items into an entity, ensure that the required items are available in your inventory to avoid operation failures.\n\n### Inserter Blocked by Full Destination\n- Ensure that the destination inventory has space available before attempting to transfer items. Regularly monitor and manage storage capacities to prevent blockages.\n\n### Chest is Full\n- Regularly manage and expand storage capacities to prevent chests from becoming full, which can halt production processes."}
