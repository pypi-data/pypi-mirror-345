For example, 'Furnace' objects do not have a 'prototype_name' attribute. Verify object types before accessing attributes.\n\n### Errors with NoneType Objects\n- Avoid attempting to access attributes of NoneType objects. Ensure that objects are properly initialized and not None before accessing their attributes, such as 'tile_dimensions'.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that inserters have a valid source from which to pick up items. Check that the source contains the necessary items for the inserter to operate efficiently."}
