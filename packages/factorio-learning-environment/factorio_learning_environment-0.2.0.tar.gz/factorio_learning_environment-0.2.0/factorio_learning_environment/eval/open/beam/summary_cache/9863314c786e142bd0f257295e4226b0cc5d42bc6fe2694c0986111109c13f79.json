{"content": "It seems there is still an issue with the import statement for the `uniform` function. Let's ensure that the import is correctly placed and used. Here's how you can fix it:\n\n```python\nimport random  # Correctly import the random module\n\ndef ensure_entity_placement(prototype, position=None):\n    \"\"\"Ensure that a given entity is placed. Returns the placed entity.\"\"\"\n    entities = get_entities({prototype})\n    if entities:\n        return entities[0]\n    else:\n        # If the position is not specified, choose a random position\n        if position is None:\n            position = Position(random.uniform(-10, 10), random.uniform(-10, 10))\n        print(f\"Placing {prototype} at {position}.\")\n        return place_entity(prototype, position)\n\n# Use the function to place necessary entities\n\n# Placing the offshore pump\noffshore_pump = ensure_entity_placement(Prototype.OffshorePump)\n\n# If successful, calculate a position below the offshore pump for the boiler\nboiler_position = offshore_pump.position.down() if offshore_pump else Position(0, -1)\nboiler = ensure_entity_placement(Prototype.Boiler, boiler_position)\n\n# Placing the steam engine next to the boiler\nsteam_engine_position = boiler.position.right() if boiler else Position(2, 0)\nsteam_engine = ensure_entity_placement(Prototype.SteamEngine, steam_engine_position)\n\n# Placing the electric pole to connect entities\nelectric_pole_position = steam_engine_position.right() if steam_engine else Position(4, 0)\nelectric_pole = ensure_entity_placement(Prototype.SmallElectricPole, electric_pole_position)\n\n# Placing the assembling machine close by\nassembling_machine_position = electric_pole_position.right() if electric_pole else Position(6, 0)\nassembling_machine = ensure_entity_placement(Prototype.AssemblingMachine1, assembling_machine_position)\n\n# Attempt connecting them if all are placed\ntry:\n    # Refuel the boiler if necessary\n    fuel_level = inspect_inventory(boiler).get(Prototype.Coal, 0)\n    if fuel_level < 5:\n        insert_item(Prototype.Coal, boiler, 5 - fuel_level)\n        print(f\"Refueled Boiler. Current Fuel Level: {inspect_inventory(boiler).get(Prototype.Coal, 0)}\")\n\n    # Perform the connections\n    if offshore_pump and boiler:\n        print(f\"Water Connection (Offshore Pump -> Boiler): {'Success' if connect_entities(offshore_pump, boiler) else 'Failed'}\")\n    if boiler and steam_engine:\n        print(f\"Steam Connection (Boiler -> Steam Engine): {'Success' if connect_entities(boiler, steam_engine) else 'Failed'}\")\n    if steam_engine and electric_pole:\n        print(f\"Power Connection (Steam Engine -> Electric Pole): {'Success' if connect_entities(steam_engine, electric_pole) else 'Failed'}\")\n    if electric_pole and assembling_machine:\n        print(f\"Power Connection (Electric Pole -> Assembling Machine): {'Success' if connect_entities(electric_pole, assembling_machine) else 'Failed'}\")\n\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"Exception occurred while reattempting connections: {e}\")\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- **Correct Import**: Ensure that `import random` is used to access `random.uniform`. This allows you to use `random.uniform()` correctly in your code.\n- **Function Usage**: Use `random.uniform()` to generate random floating-point numbers within a specified range.\n- **Error Handling**: Make sure to handle any potential exceptions that might occur during the execution of your script, especially when interacting with the game environment.\n\nThis setup should resolve the `NameError` related to `uniform`. If the error persists, double-check that the script is running in an environment where the `random` module is available and correctly imported.", "summary_range": "[1-336]"}
