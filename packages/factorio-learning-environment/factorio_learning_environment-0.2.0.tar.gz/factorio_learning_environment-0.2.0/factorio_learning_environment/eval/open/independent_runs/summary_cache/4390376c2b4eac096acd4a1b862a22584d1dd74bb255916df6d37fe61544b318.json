{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=17.5, y=20.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=17.5, y=20.5) with warnings of 'no input liquid' and 'no fluid present in connections', status: NOT_CONNECTED.\n- Boiler at position (x=1.5, y=23.0) with warning 'out of fuel', status: NO_FUEL.\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5), status: WORKING.\n- Pipe connections linking the boiler and steam engine, with various pipes at positions such as (x=1.5, y=21.5), (x=17.5, y=17.5), and others forming a network.\n\n### Pipe Groups\n- PipeGroup at position (x=3.5, y=17.5), status: EMPTY, connecting various points.\n- PipeGroup at position (x=-9.5, y=23.5), status: FULL_OUTPUT, carrying water through a series of pipes.\n\n### Electricity Network\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at various positions such as (x=7.5, y=8.5), (x=1.5, y=2.5), and others, voltage: 0.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure that connection points between entities like boilers and steam engines are correctly aligned and that the entities are within reach of each other to avoid connection failures.\n\n### Attribute Errors in Code\n- Verify that all attributes used in the code are correctly defined and accessible. For example, ensure that the 'ElectricityGroup' object has the expected attributes before attempting to access them.\n\n### Errors when Using Extracting but Being Too Far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when Placing into a Tile Which is Occupied by Another Entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placement."}
