{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining Operation at Position (x=53.0, y=-83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=53.0, y=-83.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=52.5, y=-84.5).\n\n### Copper Ore Mining Operation at Position (x=-23.0, y=-68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-23.0, y=-68.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=-23.5, y=-69.5).\n- Transport Belts forming a BeltGroup connecting various positions around the mining drill.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Operation at Position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-54.5).\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-54.5) transferring items to a Wooden Chest at position (x=-12.5, y=-54.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-20.0, y=-70.0) with a warning of no ingredients to smelt.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-21.0, y=-62.0) with a warning of no ingredients to smelt.\n- Various Wooden Chests and Burner Inserters managing input and output of materials.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Incorrect Attribute Access on BeltGroup\n- Ensure that you are accessing valid attributes for the BeltGroup object. The 'prototype' attribute does not exist for BeltGroup. Verify the object type before accessing attributes.\n\n### Undefined Name 'StaticEntity'\n- Ensure that all classes or objects used in conditions are properly defined and imported. Check for typographical errors in the class or object names.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source from which the inserter is picking up items has sufficient items available. Check the inventory of the source entity to ensure it is not empty.\n\n### Furnace Warnings\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt and that their fuel sources are not full. Regularly check and manage the input and output inventories of furnaces."}
