{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-14.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-16.0, -51.0) with a drop position at (-16.5, -52.5). The drill is actively extracting iron ore and is fueled.\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-14.0, -49.0). The furnace is successfully producing iron plates, fueled by coal and receiving iron ore from the mining drill.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Lack of Inventory Items\n- Ensure that you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to place them. For example, the attempt to place a burner mining drill failed due to the absence of the item in the inventory.\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities\n- Verify that the desired location is suitable and unoccupied before attempting to place an entity. This includes ensuring there is no obstruction or existing entity at the target location.\n- Common placement errors include attempts to place Wooden Chests, Transport Belts, and Burner Inserters at unsuitable locations.\n\n### Furnace Setup Errors\n- Regularly check the setup of your furnace to ensure it is correctly configured to produce iron plates. Ensure that it is fueled and receiving the necessary raw materials.\n\n### Clearing Drop Positions\n- Regularly clear items from the drill's drop position to prevent overflow and ensure continuous operation of the mining drill."}
