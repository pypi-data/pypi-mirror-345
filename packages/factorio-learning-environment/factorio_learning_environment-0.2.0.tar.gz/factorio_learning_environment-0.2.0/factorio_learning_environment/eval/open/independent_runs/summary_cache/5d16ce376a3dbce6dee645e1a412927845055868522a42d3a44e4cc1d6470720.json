{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 19.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Steam Engine** at position (-5.5, 19.5)\n- **Boiler** at position (-2.5, 24.0)\n- **Offshore Pump** at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- **PipeGroup** connecting the boiler to the steam engine, with pipes positioned from (-5.5, 16.5) to (-2.5, 22.5)\n- **PipeGroup** connecting the offshore pump to the boiler, with pipes positioned from (-8.5, 23.5) to (-4.5, 24.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Undefined Variables\n- Ensure all variables are defined before use. For instance, `steam_engine_buildable_area` must be defined before it can be used.\n\n### Type Errors in Calculations\n- When performing arithmetic operations, ensure that the operands are of compatible types. For example, avoid adding a 'ModelPrivateAttr' to an 'int'.\n\n### Crafting Errors Due to Missing Ingredients\n- Before attempting to craft an item, verify that all required ingredients are available in the inventory. For instance, crafting a steam engine requires iron plates and iron gear wheels, which in turn require iron plates.\n\n### Placement Errors Due to Inventory Shortages\n- Ensure that the item you are trying to place is available in your inventory. For example, attempting to place a steam engine without having it in the inventory will result in an error.\n\n### Connection Errors Due to Missing Items\n- Ensure you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to connect entities. For example, connecting pipes requires having pipes in the inventory.\n\n### Insertion Errors Due to Inventory Shortages\n- Verify that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. For example, inserting coal into a boiler requires having coal in the inventory."}
