Clear inventory or use chests to store excess items.\n\n#### Entity Placement Errors\n- Ensure the target position is clear before placing an entity. Remove existing entities if necessary.\n\n#### Crafting Errors\n- Check inventory for required materials before attempting to craft. Ensure there is enough space in the inventory for the crafted item.\n\n#### Fuel and Resource Management\n- Ensure mining drills and furnaces have sufficient fuel and resources to operate. Regularly check and refill fuel and resource supplies.\n\n#### Chest Management\n- Regularly empty full chests to prevent mining operations from halting due to lack of storage space. Distribute items across multiple chests if necessary."}
