You need to add an inserter that inputs items into Prototype.SteamEngine and use the inserter as the target entity.\u201d\n\u2002 \u2013 Mitigation: Verify the target entity type before connecting belts and ensure that an appropriate inserter (not a steam engine) is used as the belt\u2019s endpoint.\n\n\u2022 Wooden Chest Placement Errors (Steps 212 and 213)\n\u2002 \u2013 Errors encountered due to:\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Target position being too far (distance exceeds maximum allowable)\n\u2003\u2003\u2022 Lack of a wooden chest in the inventory during placement\n\u2002 \u2013 Mitigation: Move closer to the target placement location and confirm that the required item (wooden chest) is available in the inventory before attempting placement.\n\n\u2022 Naming and Variable Reference Error (Step 212)\n\u2002 \u2013 Error: Undefined variable \u201ctarget_chest\u201d caused a NameError.\n\u2002 \u2013 Mitigation: Ensure all variables are correctly defined and consistently referenced to avoid scope and naming issues."}
