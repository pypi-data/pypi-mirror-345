{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-23.5, -69.5) for copper ore collection.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-21.0, -62.0) for smelting copper ore into copper plates, with a nearby Wooden Chest at position (-20.5, -63.5) storing iron plates.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -54.5) for iron ore collection.\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates, with a nearby Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5) storing iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) transferring items between chests at positions (1.5, 0.5) and (3.5, 0.5).\n\n### Coal Mining Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) connected to Wooden Chests at positions (52.5, -84.5) and (54.5, -84.5) for coal collection.\n\n### Expanded Furnace Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (5.0, 0.0) for additional smelting capacity.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Ensure there is no existing entity at the target position before placing a new entity. Consider adjusting the spacing or changing the direction if placement fails due to an occupied tile.\n\n### Errors with inserters waiting for source items\n- Verify that the inserter has access to source items and that there is a clear path for item transfer. Adjust the inserter's position or direction if necessary.\n\n### Errors with furnaces having no ingredients to smelt\n- Ensure that the furnace has the necessary ingredients to process. Check the input source and supply chain to maintain a steady flow of raw materials to the furnace."}
