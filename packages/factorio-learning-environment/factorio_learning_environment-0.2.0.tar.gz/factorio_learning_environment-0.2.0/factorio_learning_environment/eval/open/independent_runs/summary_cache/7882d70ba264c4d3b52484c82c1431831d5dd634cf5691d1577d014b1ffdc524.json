{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0)\n  - Fuel: Inventory({'coal': 2})\n  - Status: WORKING\n  - Warnings: Output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Resources: [Ingredient(name='iron-ore', count=40000)]\n  - Drop Position: (x=-16.5, y=-52.5)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)\n  - Fuel: Inventory({'coal': 14})\n  - Status: NO_INGREDIENTS\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Furnace Result: Inventory({'iron-plate': 60})\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- **Cannot place Wooden Chest, Stone Furnace, Transport Belt, or Burner Inserter at the desired location**: Ensure the target tile is unoccupied and suitable for the entity being placed. Check for any obstructions or existing entities that may block placement.\n\n### Errors related to entity interaction\n- **Error when extracting or inserting items**: Ensure the correct entity type is being targeted and that it contains the expected resources. For example, verify that a burner-mining-drill contains iron-ore before attempting extraction.\n- **Error when refueling or inserting items**: Ensure the necessary items (e.g., coal) are available in your inventory before attempting to refuel or insert them into entities.\n\n### Code-related errors\n- **NameError: 'ore_furnace' is not defined**: Ensure that all variables are correctly defined and initialized before use. Double-check for typos or incorrect variable names.\n\n### Warnings related to production\n- **Output blocked by item on the ground**: Make sure there is a sink entity, such as a chest or belt, to accept the output from production entities like drills and furnaces.\n- **No ingredients to smelt in Furnace**: Ensure that the furnace has the necessary ingredients to process. Check the supply chain to ensure resources are being delivered to the furnace."}
