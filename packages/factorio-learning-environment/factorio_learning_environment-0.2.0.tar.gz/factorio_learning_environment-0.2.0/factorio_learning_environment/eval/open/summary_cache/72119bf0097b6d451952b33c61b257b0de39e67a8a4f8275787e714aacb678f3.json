{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron gear wheel production line at position around (16.0, 71.0) to (21.5, 73.5)\nConsists of the following connected entities forming a production chain for iron gear wheels:\n- Burner mining drill at position (16.0, 71.0) extracting iron ore; currently fueled with coal but output blocked due to no sink entity accepting output\n- Stone furnace at position (17.0, 73.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates; fueled with coal but source inventory full causing blockage\n- Burner inserter at position (17.5, 71.5) moving iron ore from the mining drill to the furnace; currently out of fuel and waiting for space in destination\n- Burner inserter at position (23.5, 73.5) feeding iron plates into the assembling machine; out of fuel and waiting for space in destination\n- Burner inserter at position (19.5, 73.5) taking iron gear wheels from the assembling machine; out of fuel and waiting for source items\n- Wooden chest at position (18.5, 73.5) collecting iron gear wheels; currently empty\n- Assembling machine 2 at position (21.5, 73.5) set to craft iron gear wheels from iron plates; not receiving electricity and has zero energy\n- Small electric pole at position (21.5, 75.5) providing electricity connections; connected to assembler and inserters but assembler still not powered\n- Additional small electric poles at positions (18.5, 72.5) and (18.5, 75.5) connected in the power network\n\nThis structure integrates mining, smelting, assembling, and storage within a compact area, connected by inserters and powered by electric poles. However, fuel shortages in burner inserters and power issues with the assembling machine are causing production halts. Output blockages at the mining drill and furnace indicate missing or misaligned output sinks.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to fuel management in burner inserters and drills\n- Burner inserters and burner mining drills require coal or other fuel in their internal inventories to operate.\n- Ensure sufficient fuel is inserted into burner inserters and drills before attempting to use them.\n- Avoid attempting to insert fuel items when the inserter\u2019s inventory is already empty or when no fuel is available in the player inventory.\n- Regularly check fuel levels and automate fuel supply to burner entities to prevent stoppages.\n\n### Errors due to assembler not receiving power despite pole connections\n- Assembling machines may report no power even if electric poles are nearby and connected.\n- Verify that electric poles are properly connected in a continuous power network and that the assembler is within pole coverage.\n- Confirm that the power network has available energy and no voltage issues.\n- Check for warnings on the assembler entity indicating power problems and adjust pole placement or add more poles if necessary.\n\n### Errors inserting coal into burner inserters when no coal is available\n- Attempts to insert coal into burner inserters fail if the player inventory lacks coal.\n- Before inserting fuel, confirm the player inventory contains sufficient coal.\n- Implement inventory checks and harvest or collect coal proactively to maintain fuel supply.\n\n### Errors caused by output blockages in mining drills and furnaces\n- Mining drills and furnaces can become blocked if their output is not accepted by downstream entities.\n- Ensure inserters or belts are correctly positioned to remove output items promptly.\n- Verify that inserters feeding from furnaces and mining drills have fuel and are operational to prevent backups.\n\n### Errors related to attempting to insert items into entities with full or incompatible inventories\n- Inserting iron ore into furnaces fails if no iron ore is present in the player inventory.\n- Check inventory contents before insertion attempts to avoid exceptions.\n- Handle cases where target inventories are full or incompatible gracefully.\n\n### General tips to mitigate placement, fuel, and power errors\n- Confirm target tiles are free and entities are not blocked before placing or connecting.\n- Maintain adequate fuel stocks and automate fuel insertion into burner entities.\n- Regularly verify power network connectivity and energy availability.\n- Use inventory checks before inserting items to prevent exceptions.\n- Monitor entity warnings and statuses to identify and resolve operational issues promptly.\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nNo user-defined functions have been defined in the current steps."}
