{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -49.0)\n  - Status: No fuel\n  - Fuel: None\n  - Source: 12 iron ore\n  - Result: 70 iron plates\n\n### Coal Mining and Transport System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (42.0, -83.0)\n  - Fuel: 1 coal\n  - Status: Waiting for space in destination\n  - Neighbours: Transport belt at position (43.5, -82.5), Burner inserter at position (42.5, -81.5)\n- Burner Inserter at position (42.5, -81.5)\n  - Fuel: 50 coal\n  - Status: Waiting for source items\n  - Neighbours: Burner mining drill at position (42.0, -83.0), Transport belts at positions (43.5, -82.5) and (43.5, -80.5)\n- BeltGroup\n  - Inputs: Belt from (42.5, -82.5) to (44.5, -82.5), direction: Right\n  - Outputs: Belt from (43.5, -80.5) to (42.5, -79.5), direction: Left\n  - Status: Empty\n  - Belts: 7 belts\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Ensure you can place an entity on a tile before attempting placement. This includes checking if the tile is already occupied by another entity.\n\n### Errors with output blockage\n- Make sure there is a sink entity in place to accept the output from mining drills or other entities to avoid blockage.\n\n### Errors with fuel management\n- Regularly check and refuel entities like furnaces and inserters to ensure continuous operation and avoid downtime due to lack of fuel.\n\n### Errors with full inventory\n- Ensure that the destination inventory (e.g., chests, furnaces) has enough space to accommodate incoming items to prevent stoppages."}
