{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=8.5, y=36.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (x=8.5, y=36.5), currently not connected to the power network and has no input liquid.\n- Boiler at Position (x=-44.5, y=-123.0), not receiving water, with warnings of \"no input liquid\" and \"no fluid present in connections\".\n- Offshore Pump at Position (x=-45.5, y=-124.5), not connected, with warnings of \"no fluid present in connections\".\n- Pipe at Position (x=-46.5, y=-122.5) as part of the fluid system 12921, currently empty.\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=-19.0, y=-73.0) with copper plates in the result inventory but no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=9.0, y=-64.0) with iron plates in the result inventory but no ingredients to smelt.\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=6.0, y=-62.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Storage and Transfer System\nConsists of:\n- Wooden Chest at Position (x=7.5, y=-61.5) and Position (x=6.5, y=-59.5), with the latter containing iron plates.\n- Inserter at Position (x=6.5, y=-60.5), not receiving electricity, intended to transfer items between the furnace and the chest.\n\n### Research Lab\nConsists of:\n- Lab with automation science packs, currently not powered.\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of:\n- Multiple Small Electric Poles forming an electricity group (id=154222) around the area, currently with no voltage.\n\n### Pipe Networks\nConsists of multiple PipeGroups with various fluid systems, all currently empty, including:\n- PipeGroup at Position (x=-46.5, y=-122.5) for fluid system 12921.\n- Additional PipeGroups for fluid systems 12923, 12930, 12936, 12941, 12942, and 12943.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Boiler Not Receiving Water\n- Ensure that the offshore pump is correctly connected to the boiler. Check the alignment and connection points between the offshore pump and the boiler to ensure water flow.\n\n### Errors with Steam Engine Not Connected\n- Verify that the steam engine is correctly connected to the power network. Ensure that both the steam engine and the electricity network are properly aligned and connected.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Not Receiving Power\n- Check the connection between the inserter and the small electric poles. Ensure that the poles are providing power and that the inserter is within the range of the electricity network.\n\n### Errors with Empty Pipe Networks\n- Confirm that all pipe connections are correctly established and that there are no gaps or misalignments in the pipe network. Ensure that the fluid systems are properly configured to transport fluids."}
