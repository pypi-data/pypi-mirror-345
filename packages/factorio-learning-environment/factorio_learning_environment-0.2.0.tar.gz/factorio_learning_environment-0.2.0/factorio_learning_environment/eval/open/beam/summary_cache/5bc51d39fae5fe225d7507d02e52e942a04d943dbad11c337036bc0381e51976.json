{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Smelting Facility at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\n  - Fuel: 27 units of coal\n  - Current Status: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Furnace Result: Contains 6 iron plates\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities without having them in inventory\n- Ensure that you have the necessary entity in your inventory before attempting to place it on the map. For example, attempting to place a stone furnace without having one in the inventory will result in an error.\n\n### Errors when extracting items from entities without valid contents\n- Before attempting to extract items from an entity, verify that the entity contains the items you wish to extract. This will prevent errors such as attempting to extract iron plates from a furnace that does not contain any.\n\n### Repeated extraction attempts from an empty entity\n- Avoid repeatedly attempting to extract items from an entity without checking if the entity contains the desired items. This will prevent multiple failed extraction attempts, as seen in the repeated errors when trying to extract iron plates from an empty furnace. Always check the entity's contents before extraction. \n\n### Errors when attempting to extract more items than available\n- Ensure that the quantity of items you attempt to extract does not exceed the amount available in the entity. This will prevent errors such as attempting to extract more iron plates than are present in the furnace."}
