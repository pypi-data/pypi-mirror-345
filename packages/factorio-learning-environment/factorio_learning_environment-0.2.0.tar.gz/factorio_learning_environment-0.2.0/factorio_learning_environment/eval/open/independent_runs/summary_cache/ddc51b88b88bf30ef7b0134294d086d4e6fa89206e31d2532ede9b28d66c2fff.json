{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage at Position (x=53.0, y=-83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=53.0, y=-83.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=52.5, y=-84.5) for coal storage.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Transport System at Position (x=-23.0, y=-68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-23.0, y=-68.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=-23.5, y=-69.5) for copper ore storage.\n- Transport Belt system connecting the mining drill to the chest and further to a Wooden Chest at position (x=-24.5, y=-67.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Production at Position (x=-19.0, y=-65.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-19.0, y=-65.0) with a Burner Inserter at position (x=-17.5, y=-64.5) transferring iron plates to a Wooden Chest at position (x=-16.5, y=-64.5).\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Transport System at Position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0) connected to a transport belt system that moves iron ore to a processing area.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage and Transfer at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with a Burner Inserter at position (x=2.5, y=0.5) transferring iron plates to a Wooden Chest at position (x=1.5, y=0.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'tile_dimensions'\n- Verify that all entities involved in operations are correctly initialized and not `None`. Ensure that the entities are correctly referenced and instantiated before using their attributes."}
