This will prevent placement errors such as \"Could not place wooden-chest at (-14.5, -47.5), as there is an existing object in the way.\"\n\n### Errors when retrieving non-existent entities\n- Verify the presence of an entity at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it. This will avoid errors like \"Could not get Prototype.WoodenChest at position x=-14.5 y=-47.5.\"\n\n### Errors when inspecting non-existent inventories\n- Confirm that the entity exists at the given coordinates before inspecting its inventory to prevent errors such as \"Could not inspect inventory of stone-furnace.\"\n\n### Errors due to insufficient inventory items\n- Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. This will prevent errors like \"Could not insert: No coal to insert from your inventory.\""}
