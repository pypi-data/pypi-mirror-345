{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\u2022 Lab Production Attempt at (0.5, 2.5)\n  Intended to serve as a research production facility by supplying Automation Science Packs. Multiple attempts were made to craft and place a Lab at this coordinate, but all efforts failed due to missing inventory items and unmet sub-ingredient dependencies.\n\u2022 Smelting Operations (Informational)\n  Although the agent interacted with furnaces during resource processing\u2014an alternative furnace at (5.0, 5.0) for iron plate smelting and a copper furnace at (\u201327.0, \u201360.0) for copper plate production\u2014no new production structure was constructed on the map.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 get_entities() Usage Mistakes\n  \u2013 Avoid using unsupported keyword parameters (such as \u201cradius\u201d) or providing unexpected positional arguments. Always verify the correct function signature before invocation.\n\u2022 Lab Placement Failures\n  \u2013 Confirm that a Lab item is available in inventory prior to placement. Validate both resource availability and placement conditions to prevent errors when attempting to deploy structures.\n\u2022 Crafting Dependency Issues\n  \u2013 Ensure that all required sub-ingredients (for example, iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, and copper-cables) are sufficiently available or producible before initiating Lab crafting. Establish the necessary production chain for these intermediary items to avoid crafting failures.\n\u2022 Iteration on NoneType\n  \u2013 Check that retrieval functions yield valid, iterable results instead of None before performing operations that assume an iterable object."}
