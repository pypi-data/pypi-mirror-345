The 'direction' attribute does not exist for BeltGroup. Verify the object properties before accessing them.\n\n### Warnings for Furnaces with No Ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Check the supply chain to ensure resources are being delivered to the furnaces.\n\n### Output Blockage in Mining Drills\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity to accept outputs from mining drills. Avoid placing items on the ground that block the output.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that inserters have a continuous supply of source items to prevent them from stalling. Check the connected entities to ensure proper flow of materials."}
