{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0) with coal as fuel, extracting iron ore, and dropping it at position (x=-16.5, y=-52.5).\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0) with coal as fuel, smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Moving Stone Furnace\n- Ensure the target location for moving the Stone Furnace is valid and unoccupied before attempting to move it. Verify the existence of the Stone Furnace at the specified position before executing the move command.\n\n### Errors when Placing Wooden Chest\n- Confirm that the target position for placing the Wooden Chest is not obstructed by other entities or items. Ensure there is sufficient space at the intended location.\n\n### Errors when Placing Transport Belt\n- Check that the desired location for placing the Transport Belt is clear and not occupied by other entities or items. Ensure the path is unobstructed for the belt placement.\n\n### Errors when Placing Burner Inserter\n- Verify that the target position for placing the Burner Inserter is available and not blocked by other entities. Ensure the inserter can be placed without interference.\n\n### Output Blocked by Item on the Ground\n- Ensure there is a sink entity, such as a chest or furnace, to accept the output from the Burner Mining Drill. Clear any items blocking the output position to prevent blockage warnings."}
