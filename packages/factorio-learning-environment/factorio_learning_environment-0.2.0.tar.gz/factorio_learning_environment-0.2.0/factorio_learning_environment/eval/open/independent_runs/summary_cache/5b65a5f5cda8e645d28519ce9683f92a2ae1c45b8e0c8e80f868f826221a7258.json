The pickup position should match the chest's position to avoid alignment errors.\n\n### Inserter Fuel Management\n- Regularly check and refuel inserters to prevent them from running out of fuel, which can halt operations.\n\n### Inserter Setup for Iron Ore Transfer\n- Verify that the inserter setup is correct for transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace. Misalignment or incorrect setup can prevent the furnace from receiving iron ore.\n\n### Inventory Management for Fuel\n- Ensure there is sufficient coal in your inventory before attempting to refuel entities. Lack of coal will prevent refueling actions from completing successfully."}
