{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generation Setup (Partial)\n*   Consists of an Offshore Pump at `Position(x=-9.5, y=-0.5)` connected via pipes `PipeGroup(fluid_system=6398, position=x=-8.5 y=-0.5)` to a Boiler at `Position(x=-5.0, y=2.5)`.\n*   A Steam Engine is placed at `Position(x=0.5, y=6.5)`, but it is not yet connected to the boiler output via pipes. The boiler is currently out of fuel and the steam engine has no fluid input.\n\n### Coal Mining Setup\n*   Consists of an Electric Mining Drill at `Position(x=17.5, y=1.5)` (currently without power).\n*   The drill drops coal into a Wooden Chest at `Position(x=17.5, y=3.5)`.\n*   A Burner Inserter at `Position(x=17.5, y=4.5)` moves coal from the first chest to a second Wooden Chest at `Position(x=17.5, y=5.5)`.\n*   A Burner Inserter at `Position(x=17.5, y=6.5)` moves coal from the second chest onto a Transport Belt starting at `Position(x=17.5, y=7.5)`.\n*   This belt is part of a larger belt group `BeltGroup(inputs=[Belt((x=17.5 y=7.5)->, direction=Direction.RIGHT), ...])` intended to transport coal.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Setup\n*   Consists of an Electric Mining Drill at `Position(x=17.5, y=72.5)` (currently without power).\n*   The drill drops iron ore into a Wooden Chest at `Position(x=17.5, y=74.5)`.\n*   A Burner Inserter at `Position(x=17.5, y=75.5)` moves iron ore from the chest onto a Transport Belt starting"}
