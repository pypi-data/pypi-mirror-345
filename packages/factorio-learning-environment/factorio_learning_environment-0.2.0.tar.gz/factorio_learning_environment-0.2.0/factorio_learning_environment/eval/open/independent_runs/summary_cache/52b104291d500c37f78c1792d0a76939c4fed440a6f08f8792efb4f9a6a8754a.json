{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 19.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (-5.5, 19.5)\n- Boiler at position (-2.5, 24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe Group connecting various components at positions (-5.5, 16.5) and (-8.5, 23.5)\n- Electricity Group at position (-5.4, 20.0) which is not yet connected to the electric network\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Ensure you have coal in your inventory before attempting to insert it into the boiler. Check your inventory regularly to avoid running out of necessary resources.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Make sure to connect the steam engine to the electricity network using small electric poles. Ensure there is an existing electricity group to connect to, or create one if necessary.\n\n### IndexError: list index out of range\n- When creating paths or accessing lists, ensure the list is not empty and that indices are within the valid range. Double-check the logic for generating paths to avoid accessing non-existent elements."}
