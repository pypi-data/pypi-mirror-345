{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-3.5, -0.5)\nConsists of steam engine(position (-3.5, -0.5)), boiler(position (-6.5, 0.0)) and offshore pump (position (-9.5, -0.5))\n- Pipe group (fluid_system=3335, position=x=-8.5 y=-0.5) connecting offshore pump and boiler\n- Pipe group (fluid_system=3230, position=x=-4.5 y=-3.5) connecting boiler and steam engine\n- Electric pole group connecting steam engine to Assembling Machine 2\n\n### Iron ore mine at position(15.5, 70.5)\nConsists of electric mining drill(position (15.5, 70.5)) and a chest at position(15.5, 72.5)\n- Belt group connecting electric mining drill and chest\n- Burner inserter at position(14.5, 72.5) and burner inserter at position(17.5, 72.5)\n\n### Copper ore mine at position(-45.5, 70.5)\nConsists of electric mining drill(position (-45.5, 70.5)) and a chest at position(-45.5, 72.5)\n- Burner inserter at position(-43.5, 72.5)\n\n### Iron smelter at position(16.0, 75.0)\nConsists of stone furnace(position (16.0, 75.0)) and an inserter at position(14.5, 75.5)\n- Belt group connecting iron ore mine to iron smelter\n\n### Copper smelter at position(-45.0, 75.0)\nConsists of stone furnace(position (-45.0, 75.0)) and an inserter at position(-46.5, 75.5)\n- Belt group connecting copper ore mine to copper smelter\n\n### Iron gear wheel factory at position(0.5, 0.5)\nConsists of Assembling Machine 2 at position(0.5, 0.5)\n\nNo new structures have been detected in the latest execution logs.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied positions\n- Ensure the target position is not occupied by another entity before attempting to place a new entity.\n- Consider increasing the spacing or changing the direction when placing entities next to existing ones.\n\n### Errors when connecting entities directly\n- Transport belts cannot be connected directly from a chest object as a source. Add an inserter that takes items from the chest and use the inserter as a source entity.\n\n### Errors due to lack of fuel or ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces and inserter have sufficient fuel.\n- Ensure that furnaces have the required ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Errors when extracting items from an entity\n- Ensure that the entity contains the item you are trying to extract.\n- Check the entity's inventory before attempting to extract entity.\n\n### Errors when crafting items\n- Ensure that you have the required ingredients and crafting machines to craft the desired item.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into an inserter\n- Ensure that the inserter has the required items to insert.\n\n### Errors when connecting transport belts\n- Ensure that transport belts are connected correctly, with valid source and destination entities.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient ingredients for crafting sub-components\n- Ensure that you have the required ingredients to craft sub-components of the desired item.\n\n### Errors due to lack of assembling machines\n- Ensure that you have an available assembling machine to craft the desired item.\n\n### Errors when attempting to insert items into an assembling machine\n- Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory to insert into the assembling machine.\n\n### Errors when extracting items from an assembling machine\n- Ensure that the assembling machine has finished crafting the desired item before attempting to extract it.\n\n### Errors when connecting pipes between entities\n- Ensure that pipes are connected correctly between entities, with valid source and destination entities.\n- Make sure none of the source or target connections points are blocked and the target is able to receive the fluid from the source.\n\n### Errors due to invalid entity references\n- Ensure that entity references are valid and correctly typed.\n\n### Errors due to missing entity attributes\n- Ensure that the entity has the required attributes before attempting to access them.\n\n### New error tips from the latest execution logs\n### Errors when attempting to connect pipes to an entity that is already connected\n- Check if the entity is already connected to another entity before attempting to connect a pipe.\n\n### Errors due to undefined names\n- Ensure that all names used in the code are defined before they are used.\n\n### Errors due to AttributeError\n- Ensure that the entity or object being accessed has the required attribute.\n\n### Additional error tips from the logs\n### Errors when steam engine is not connected to power network\n- Ensure that the steam engine is connected to the power network.\n\n### Errors when assembling machine"}
