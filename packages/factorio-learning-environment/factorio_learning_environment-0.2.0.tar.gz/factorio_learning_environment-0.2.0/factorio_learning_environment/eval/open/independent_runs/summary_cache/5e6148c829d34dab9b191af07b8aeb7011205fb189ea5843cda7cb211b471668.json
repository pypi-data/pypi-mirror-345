{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) with a drop position at (-14.5, -48.5). This drill is responsible for extracting iron ore.\n- **Iron Chests** at positions (-18.5, -48.5), (-16.5, -48.5), and (-15.5, -48.5) for storing iron ore. The chest at (-14.5, -48.5) is a wooden chest used for temporary storage.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (-13.0, -48.0), (-11.0, -48.0), and (-9.0, -48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates. These furnaces are fueled by coal.\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (41.0, -82.0) with a drop position at (41.5, -80.5). This drill extracts coal.\n- **Iron Chests** at positions (41.5, -80.5), (42.5, -80.5), (44.5, -80.5), (45.5, -80.5), (47.5, -80.5), and (49.5, -80.5) for storing coal.\n- **Burner Inserters** at positions (43.5, -80.5) and (41.5, -78.5) for transferring coal between chests and furnaces.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Extracting Resources\n- Ensure that the target storage or chest is not full or inaccessible before attempting to extract resources. Check the inventory status of the chest and clear space if necessary.\n\n### Errors when Clearing Drop Chests\n- Verify that the drop chest is not full or blocked by other entities. Ensure there is enough space to transfer items from the mining drill to the chest.\n\n### Errors when Extracting from Furnaces\n- Confirm that the furnace is not empty or lacking the necessary ingredients to produce the desired output. Ensure that the furnace is operational and has sufficient fuel and raw materials.\n\n### Errors when Refueling\n- Make sure that the entity being refueled is not already full of fuel. Check the fuel inventory of the entity before attempting to refuel.\n\n### General Placement Errors\n- Ensure that the target tile for placing an entity is not occupied by another entity. Verify the placement area is clear and suitable for the intended entity."}
