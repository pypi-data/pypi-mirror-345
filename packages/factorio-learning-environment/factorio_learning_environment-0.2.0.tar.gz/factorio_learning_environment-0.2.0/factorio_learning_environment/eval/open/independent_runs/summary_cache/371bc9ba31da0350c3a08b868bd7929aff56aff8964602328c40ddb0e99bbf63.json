{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (9.0, -64.0) with a fuel inventory of coal and a status indicating no ingredients to smelt.\n- Stone Furnace at position (6.0, -62.0) with a fuel inventory of coal and a status indicating no ingredients to smelt.\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) connected to small electric poles and a wooden chest, currently not receiving electricity.\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (-1.5, 24.5), currently not connected to the power network and lacking input liquid.\n- Boiler at position (-5.5, 24.0), with no input liquid and not connected.\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5), not connected and with no fluid present in connections.\n- PipeGroup at position (-6.5, 25.5), empty and not properly connected to facilitate fluid flow.\n\n### Lab Facility\n- Lab at position (not specified), with automation science packs input but not receiving power.\n\n### Storage Facility\n- Wooden Chest at position (7.5, -61.5) and another at (6.5, -59.5), used for storing items like iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing pipes\n- Ensure that the target tile is free from obstructions before attempting to place a pipe. Check for existing objects that might block placement.\n\n### Errors in connecting steam engine and boiler\n- Verify that pipes are correctly connected between the boiler and steam engine. Ensure there are no blockages and that all connections are properly aligned.\n\n### Power distribution issues\n- Confirm that all entities requiring power, such as the lab and inserters, are connected to an active power network. Check connections between power poles and ensure the steam engine is generating power.\n\n### Fluid connection errors\n- Make sure that all fluid connections, especially from the offshore pump to the boiler, are complete and free of gaps. Check for missing pipes or incorrect placements that might disrupt fluid flow."}
