{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo complete structures have been successfully established on the map. Multiple attempts were made to place a Lab at position (0.5, 2.5), but all such efforts failed due to inventory shortages and unmet crafting prerequisites. While furnace entities were referenced for smelting operations, no new composite production structures were created by the agent.\n\nERROR TIPS\n- API Usage: When retrieving entities, use the correct function signature. Avoid passing unrecognized keyword arguments (e.g., omit \u201cradius\u201d) or extraneous positional arguments.\n- Inventory and Placement: Always verify that the required structure (such as a Lab) is available in the inventory before attempting placement.\n- Data Validation: Ensure that the return value from get_entities is valid and iterable (not None) prior to processing its contents.\n- Crafting Dependencies: Confirm that all necessary sub-ingredients (for example, iron-gear-wheels, electronic circuits, and copper cables) and supporting production facilities (such as furnaces or crafting machines) are available before initiating the crafting of complex structures like the Lab."}
