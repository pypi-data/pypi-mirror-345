{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (41.0, -82.0) with a drop position at (40.5, -83.5).\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (40.5, -83.5) and (42.5, -83.5) for coal storage.\n- **Transport Belt** connecting the mining drill to the chest at position (40.5, -83.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0) fueled by coal, with iron ore supplied.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (1.5, 0.5) transferring items from a chest at (2.5, 0.5) to the furnace.\n- **Chest** at position (2.5, 0.5) for storing intermediate items.\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (10.0, 0.0) with copper ore supplied.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (8.5, 0.5) transferring items from a chest at (7.5, 0.5) to the furnace.\n- **Chest** at position (7.5, 0.5) for storing intermediate items.\n\n### Copper Plate Storage Facility\n- **Chest** at position (12.5, 0.5) storing copper plates.\n\n### Transport System\n- **BeltGroup** connecting positions (3.5, 0.5) to (6.5, 0.5) facilitating item movement between various entities.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Supplying Source Items to Inserters\n- Ensure that the source entity contains the required items before attempting to supply them to an inserter. This error occurred at positions (3.5, 0.5) and (6.5, 0.5) where iron plates were not found.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Regularly check and refill source entities to prevent inserters from waiting for items, as seen with inserters at positions (3.5, 0.5), (6.5, 0.5), (8.5, 0.5), and (11.5, 0.5).\n\n### Chest Blockage Warnings\n- Monitor and clear chests regularly to prevent mining drills from halting operations due to full chests, as indicated by the warning at position (40.5, -83.5).\n\nBy addressing these errors, the efficiency of the operations can be significantly improved."}
