{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) and another at position (-12.0, -48.0)\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -47.5) feeding into a Wooden Chest at position (-13.5, -46.5)\n- Transport Belt network connecting the furnaces and chests\n\n### Iron Plate Storage and Distribution\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (-13.5, -44.5) storing iron plates\n- Iron Chest at position (-11.5, -44.5) storing iron plates\n- Burner Inserter at position (-14.5, -45.5) and another at position (-11.5, -45.5) managing item flow\n- Transport Belt network facilitating movement between chests and inserters\n\n### Electricity Generation Attempt\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Boiler at position (0.0, 0.5)\n- Steam Engine at position (3.5, 0.5)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe network attempting to connect the boiler and steam engine\n\n### Water Supply System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe Group with fluid system 7172, transporting water from the offshore pump\n\n### Transport Belt System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Belt Group connecting various positions for item transport\n- Includes belts at positions such as (-11.5, -46.5) to (-9.5, -46.5) and (-8.5, -45.5) to (-8.5, -43.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Operations\n- Ensure that the source entities for inserters have items available for transfer. Inserters at positions such as (-13.5, -47.5) and (-14.5, -45.5) are waiting for source items.\n\n### Errors with Connection of Boiler and Steam Engine\n- Verify the correct positioning and connection of pipes between the boiler and steam engine. Multiple attempts to connect pipes at positions (0.0, 0.5) and (3.5, 0.5) have failed.\n- Ensure the correct type of pipe is used and that there are no obstructions in the intended path of the connection.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Destination\n- Ensure that the destination for inserters is not blocked. The inserter at position (-11.5, -45.5) is waiting for space in the destination.\n\n### General Connection Errors\n- Double-check all connections between entities to ensure they are correctly aligned and compatible."}
