{"content": "Here is the updated report based on the execution logs:\n\n# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining System (around x=41, y=-82)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0) mining coal\n- Input chest (iron chest) at (41.5, -83.5) storing coal\n- Output chest (wooden chest) at (41.5, -80.5) storing coal\n- Additional storage chest (iron chest) at (41.5, -84.5) storing coal\n\n### Iron Smelting System (around x=46, y=-80)\nConsists of:\n- Input chest (wooden chest) at (46.5, -79.5) storing iron ore\n- Two stone furnaces:\n  - First furnace at (45.0, -81.0)\n  - Second furnace at (47.0, -81.0)\n- Two burner inserters:\n  - First inserter at (45.5, -79.5) moving items from chest to first furnace\n  - Second inserter at (47.5, -79.5) moving items from chest to second furnace\n- Output chest (wooden chest) at (49.5, -80.5) storing iron plates\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Chest Management Issues\n- Monitor chest capacity - several chests are showing \"chest is full\" warnings\n- Empty output chests regularly to prevent production blockages\n\n### Fuel Management\n- Keep mining drills fueled - one drill shows \"out of fuel\" warning\n- Ensure consistent fuel supply to all burner-powered entities\n\n### Production Flow Issues\n- Inserters showing \"furnace belt at drop position is blocked\" warnings - ensure proper item flow\n- Monitor furnace input/output to prevent bottlenecks\n- Ensure proper alignment between inserters and their target entities\n\n### Resource Management\n- Verify resource availability before attempting insertion operations\n- Maintain adequate iron ore supply to keep smelting system running efficiently\n\n# NAMESPACE\n\n### Variables\n- `chest`: Entity (wooden-chest)\n- `iron_ore`: Item quantity\n- `source_chest`: Entity (wooden-chest)\n\n### Functions\n- `insert_item(prototype, target, quantity)`: Attempts to insert items into target entity\n  - Success: When items exist in inventory and target has space\n  - Failure: When items don't exist in inventory\n- `extract_item(prototype, source, quantity)`: Attempts to extract items from source entity\n  - Success: When items exist in source\n  - Failure: When items not found in source or source entity invalid"}
