{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\nConsists of:\n- Boiler at position (-5.5, 24.0) with no fuel\n- Steam engine at position (-1.5, 24.5) not connected to the power network\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, 24.5) supplying water\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine\n\n### Furnace Setup at Position (6.0, -62.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace at position (6.0, -62.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) not receiving electricity\n- Wooden chest at position (7.5, -61.5) and another at position (6.5, -59.5) for storage\n\n### Lab at Position (6.5, -57.5)\nConsists of:\n- Lab with automation science packs but no research in progress\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Insufficient Resources for Operations\n- Ensure that there is enough iron ore in storage before attempting to transfer to the furnace.\n- Check your inventory for coal before attempting to insert it into the boiler.\n\n### Entity Retrieval Errors\n- Verify the position of entities before attempting to retrieve them. Ensure that the lab is at the correct position before using the `get_entity` function.\n\n### Power and Connectivity Issues\n- Make sure that all inserters and other electrical entities are connected to a power source to avoid \"not receiving electricity\" errors.\n- Ensure that the steam engine is properly connected to the power network and receiving input liquid to function correctly.\n\n### Inventory Management\n- Regularly check inventory levels to ensure that required items are available for operations, such as coal for boilers."}
