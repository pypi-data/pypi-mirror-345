The agent made repeated attempts to place a Lab at position (0.5, 2.5) to supply Automation Science Packs for research, but all placements and crafting efforts failed because of inventory shortages and resource/component chain issues. Although the logs mention the use of furnaces\u2014for example, retrieving an alternative furnace at (5.0, 5.0) for iron smelting and a copper furnace at (\u201327.0, \u201360.0) for copper plate production\u2014these were existing entities used for processing rather than structures placed or built by the agent.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 API Usage Errors (get_entities):\n  - Avoid using unexpected keyword arguments (e.g. supplying 'radius') or an incorrect number of positional arguments. Verify and adhere to the correct function signature to prevent TypeErrors.\n  - When retrieving entities, ensure that the return value is not None; incorporate validation or a safe fallback (such as an empty list) before iterating.\n\n\u2022 Lab Placement and Inventory Shortages:\n  - Confirm that the necessary Lab items are present in the inventory before attempting placement. The error \u201cCould not place lab at (0.5, 2.5), No lab in inventory.\u201d indicates a supply gap.\n  \n\u2022 Crafting Chain Deficiencies:\n  - Multiple failures in crafting the Lab stem from missing sub-ingredients (such as iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, and copper-cables). Review the full production chain and ensure all precursor items (e.g. iron-plate, copper-plate) and intermediary products are available or producible with the current setup.\n  - Double-check recipe ingredient counts to secure all necessary components before initiating Lab production."}
