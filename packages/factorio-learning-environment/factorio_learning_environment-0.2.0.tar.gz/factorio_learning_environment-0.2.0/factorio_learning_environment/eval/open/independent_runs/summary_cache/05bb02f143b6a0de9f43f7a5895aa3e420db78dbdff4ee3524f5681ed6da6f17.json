{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) with a drop position at (41.5, -80.5), currently fueled with coal and operational.\n- Stone Furnace at position (41.0, -80.0), currently out of fuel and lacking ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Iron Plate Mine at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) with a drop position at (-14.5, -48.5), currently fueled with coal and operational.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) for storing mined iron ore.\n\n### Copper Furnace at Position (-20.0, -71.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -71.0), currently out of fuel and lacking ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Storage Facility\n- Wooden Chest at position (43.5, -79.5) for general storage purposes.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Insufficient Inventory for Insertion\n- Ensure that there is enough coal in the inventory before attempting to insert it into any mining drill or furnace. This can be avoided by checking the inventory levels before the insertion operation.\n\n### Errors when Furnaces are Out of Fuel or Ingredients\n- Regularly check and replenish fuel and ingredients in furnaces to ensure continuous operation. This involves monitoring the status of furnaces and refueling or restocking as necessary.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `insert_item`: Used for inserting items into entities. Ensure that the inventory has sufficient items before calling this function to prevent errors.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `copper_drill`: Represents the copper mining drill entity.\n- `iron_furnace`: Represents the iron furnace entity.\n\nThis report provides a comprehensive overview of the current structures and operational errors, offering actionable insights to optimize the agent's performance in the game."}
