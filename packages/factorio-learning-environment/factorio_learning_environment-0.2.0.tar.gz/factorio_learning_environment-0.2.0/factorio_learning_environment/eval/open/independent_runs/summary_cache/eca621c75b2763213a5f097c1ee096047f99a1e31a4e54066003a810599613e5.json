{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Boiler at position (-5.5, 24.0) with warnings of 'no input liquid' and 'no fluid present in connections'\n- Steam engine at position (-1.5, 24.5) with warnings of 'not connected to power network', 'no input liquid', and 'no fluid present in connections'\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, 24.5) which is working and connected to a pipe at position (-9.5, 23.5)\n\n### Pipe Network\n- PipeGroup with fluid system 874, containing water at position (-9.5, 23.5), status: FULL_OUTPUT\n- PipeGroup with fluid system 877, empty, spanning positions from (-2.5, 22.5) to (1.5, 24.5)\n\n### Smelting Area\n- Stone furnace at position (9.0, -64.0) with a warning of 'no ingredients to smelt'\n- Stone furnace at position (6.0, -62.0) with a warning of 'no ingredients to smelt'\n\n### Storage and Transport\n- Wooden chest at position (7.5, -61.5), status: NORMAL\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) with a warning of 'not receiving electricity'\n- Wooden chest at position (6.5, -59.5), status: NORMAL, containing 'iron-plate' and 'copper-plate'\n\n### Research Facility\n- Lab with input of 'automation-science-pack' and status: NO_RESEARCH_IN_PROGRESS\n\n### Electricity Network\n- ElectricityGroup with poles spanning multiple positions, voltage: 0\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Pipe Connection\n- Ensure that pipes are correctly aligned and connected to form a continuous fluid system. Verify that the pipe connections are not overlapping or misaligned, which can cause connection failures.\n\n### Fluid System Mismatch\n- Verify that the offshore pump and boiler are on the same fluid system. Ensure that all components of the fluid system are properly connected and configured to avoid mismatches.\n\n### Inserter Power Issues\n- Ensure that inserters are connected to a power source. Check the connections to the power network and ensure that the electricity group is functional and providing power to all connected entities.\n\n### Boiler and Steam Engine Connectivity\n- Check that the boiler and steam engine are correctly connected to the fluid system and power network. Ensure that there are no missing connections or misconfigurations that prevent fluid and power flow."}
