{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (20.5, -4.0)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (19.5, -1.5)\n- Boiler at Position (20.5, -4.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (22.5, -7.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting these entities\n\n### Copper Cable Factory at Position (10.5, 0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling Machine at Position (10.5, 0.5)\n- Inserter at Position (-3.5, 1.5) that puts into the Assembling Machine\n- BeltGroup connecting the Furnace to the Assembling Machine\n- Small Electric Poles providing power (though currently not receiving electricity)\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Site at Position (-11.0, 20.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-11.0, 20.0)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (-11.5, 18.5) for storing mined iron ore\n\n### Copper Ore Mining Site at Position (20.0, 20.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (20.0, 20.0)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (19.5, 18.5) for storing mined copper ore\n\n### Iron Plate Smelting Facility at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (2.0, 0.0)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### AttributeError on PipeGroup\n- Ensure that you are accessing valid attributes on the PipeGroup object. The 'fluid_box' attribute does not exist on PipeGroup; check the documentation for correct attributes.\n\n### Exception: No Coal to Insert\n- Before attempting to insert coal into the boiler, verify that you have coal in your inventory. If not, gather or mine coal first.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Not Receiving Electricity\n- Check the connection of electric poles to ensure that inserters are receiving power. Ensure that all necessary electric poles are connected to a power source.\n\n### Boiler Out of Fuel\n- Regularly check the fuel levels of boilers and ensure they are refueled with coal or other appropriate fuel sources to maintain operation.\n\n### Assembling Machine Missing Resources\n- Ensure that all required resources (e.g., copper plates for copper cable production) are available in the assembling machine's input inventory."}
