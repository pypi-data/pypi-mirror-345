{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-12.5, 24.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (-12.5, 24.5)\n- Boiler at position (-5.5, 25.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Multiple Pipe Groups connecting these components, with pipes at various positions including (-4.5, 23.5), (-3.5, 23.5), etc.\n- Electricity Group with poles at positions such as (7.5, 10.5), (17.5, -0.5), and others.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (15.0, 0.0) with a status of no ingredients to smelt.\n- Wooden Chest at position (5.5, 0.5) containing iron ore.\n- Inserters at positions (17.5, 0.5) and (16.5, 0.5), both with warnings of not receiving electricity.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Boiler and Steam Engine Not Connected\n- Ensure all components of the electricity generator are properly connected. Check that the pipes are correctly placed and connected to the boiler and steam engine to allow fluid flow.\n\n### Errors when Placing Pipes\n- Verify that the target tile for placing pipes is not obstructed by other entities. Adjust the position or clear obstructions before attempting to place pipes.\n\n### Errors with Unsupported Operand Types\n- When performing operations on entities, ensure that the data types are compatible. Avoid using unsupported operations between different data types.\n\n### Errors with Entity Placement\n- Before placing an entity, confirm that the target position is clear of other objects. If an entity cannot be placed, consider moving existing entities or selecting an alternative location.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Not Receiving Power\n- Ensure that inserters are connected to a power source. Check the connections between inserters and electric poles to resolve power supply issues."}
