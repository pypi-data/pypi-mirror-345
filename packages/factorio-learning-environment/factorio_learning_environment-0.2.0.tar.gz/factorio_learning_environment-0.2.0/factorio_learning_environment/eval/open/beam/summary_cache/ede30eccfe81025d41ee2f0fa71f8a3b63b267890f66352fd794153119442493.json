{"content": "I see the issue now. Let me analyze what's happening:\n\n1. Current State:\n- We have limited iron plates (only 1, not 40 as previously assumed)\n- We can't directly craft iron gear wheels because it requires a specific crafting machine\n- The recipe shows it needs 2 iron plates per gear wheel\n\n2. Problem:\n- We need an assembly machine to craft iron gear wheels\n- Direct crafting isn't possible for this item\n- We need more iron plates first\n\nLet's try a new approach:\n\n```python\n# First check our current inventory\ninventory = inspect_inventory()\nprint(f\"Current inventory: {inventory}\")\n\n# We need to smelt more iron plates first\nprint(\"Looking for stone furnaces...\")\nfurnaces = get_entities({Prototype.StoneFurnace})\nprint(f\"Found {len(furnaces)} furnaces\")\n\n# Find nearest iron ore\nore_location = nearest(Resource.IronOre)\nprint(f\"Found iron ore at: {ore_location}\")\n\nif furnaces:\n    # Use existing furnace\n    furnace = furnaces[0]\n    print(f\"Using furnace at {furnace.position}\")\n    \n    # Move to furnace\n    move_to(furnace.position)\n    \n    # Add fuel and ore\n    print(\"Adding fuel and ore...\")\n    insert_item(Prototype.Coal, furnace, quantity=5)\n    insert_item(Prototype.IronOre, furnace, quantity=10)\n    \n    print(\"Waiting for smelting...\")\n    # Wait for smelting to complete\n    wait_for_item(Prototype.IronPlate, quantity=10)\n\n# Check final inventory\nfinal_inventory = inspect_inventory()\nprint(f\"Final inventory: {final_inventory}\")\n```\n\nThis new approach:\n1. Focuses on getting more iron plates first\n2. Uses existing furnaces\n3. Adds both fuel and ore\n4. Waits for smelting to complete\n\nWe need to build up our iron plate supply before we can proceed with crafting gear wheels in an assembly machine.", "summary_range": "[1-2032]"}
