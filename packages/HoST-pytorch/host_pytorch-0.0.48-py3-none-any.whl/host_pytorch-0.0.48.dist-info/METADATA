## HoST - Pytorch (wip)

Implementation of Humanoid Standing Up, from the paper <a href="https://taohuang13.github.io/humanoid-standingup.github.io/">Learning Humanoid Standing-up Control across Diverse Postures</a> out of Shanghai, in Pytorch

Besides for the set of reward functions, the other contribution is validating [an approach using multiple critics](https://openreview.net/forum?id=rJvY_5OzoI) out of Boston University

## Install

```bash
$ pip install HoST-pytorch
```

## Usage

```python
import torch
from host_pytorch import Agent
from host_pytorch.mock_env import Env, mock_hparams

env = Env()

agent = Agent(
    num_actions = (10, 10, 20),
    actor = dict(
        dims = (env.dim_state, 256, 128),
    ),
    critics = dict(
        dims = (env.dim_state, 256),
    ),
    reward_hparams = mock_hparams()
)

memories = agent(env)

agent.learn(memories)

agent.save('./standing-up-policy.pt', overwrite = True)
```
