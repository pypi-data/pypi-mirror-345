{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and deposits it into a chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates, but currently not receiving iron ore due to setup issues.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Inserter Setup\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items from the source (chest) to the destination (furnace). Repeated adjustments indicate potential misalignment or incorrect positioning.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Iron Ore\n- Verify that the inserter is operational and correctly configured to move iron ore from the chest to the furnace. Check for any blockages or misconfigurations that prevent the transfer.\n\n### Insufficient Fuel for Operations\n- Regularly check and maintain adequate coal supplies to refuel mining drills and inserters. Lack of fuel can halt operations.\n\n### Chest Overflow\n- Monitor the chest inventory to prevent overflow. Regularly extract items to maintain space for continuous mining operations."}
