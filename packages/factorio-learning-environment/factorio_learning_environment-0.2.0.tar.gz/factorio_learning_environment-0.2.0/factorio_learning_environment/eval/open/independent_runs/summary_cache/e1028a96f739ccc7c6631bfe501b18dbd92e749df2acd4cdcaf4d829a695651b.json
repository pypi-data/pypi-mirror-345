{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report (Updated)\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power generation facility at x=-9.5 to x=-2.5\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump (x=-9.5, y=-0.5) - working, producing water\n- Boiler (x=-6.5, y=0.0) - now fueled with coal (28 remaining), producing steam\n- Steam engine (x=-2.5, y=0.5) - working, connected to power network\n- Pipe network (system 1487/1488) connecting all components\n\n### Oil production facility at x=17.5 to x=37.5\nConsists of:\n- Pumpjack (x=17.5, y=40.5) - now placed and powered, producing crude oil\n- Oil refinery (x=27.5, y=40.5) - powered, set to BasicOilProcessing, showing FLUID_INGREDIENT_SHORTAGE\n- Storage tank (x=32.5, y=40.5) - empty\n- Chemical plant (x=37.5, y=40.5) - powered, set to PlasticBar recipe, showing ITEM_INGREDIENT_SHORTAGE\n- Wooden chest with coal (x=37.5, y=37.5) - contains 140 coal\n- Inserter (x=37.5, y=38.5) - powered but waiting for source items\n- Connected pipe network from pumpjack to refinery (system 1492)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Fluid system configuration errors\n- Refinery shows FLUID_INGREDIENT_SHORTAGE despite connected pumpjack:\n  - Verify refinery input connection points (x=28.5 y=43.5) are properly connected\n  - Check pipe directionality and fluid flow direction\n  - Ensure pumpjack output is reaching refinery input\n\n### Chemical plant operation issues\n- Chemical plant shows ITEM_INGREDIENT_SHORTAGE for coal:\n  - Verify inserter is correctly configured to move coal from chest\n  - Check inserter pickup/drop positions (currently reversed)\n  - Ensure chemical plant input slots are accessible\n\n### Power distribution problems\n- Pumpjack briefly showed NO_POWER status:\n  - Verify all power poles between steam engine and pumpjack are connected\n  - Check power network coverage in oil facility area\n\n### Entity placement mistakes\n- Repeated attempts to place pumpjack while too far away:\n  - Always move within 10 tiles before placing entities\n  - Verify position is clear before placement attempts\n\n### Previous errors still applicable:\n- Pipe connection verification (check all connections sequentially)\n- Production monitoring (verify refinery output before connecting downstream)\n- Entity inspection (check fluid contents before connection attempts)\n- Inserter configuration (verify pickup/drop positions)"}
