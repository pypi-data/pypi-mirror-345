{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Furnace at position (0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position (0, 0)) with fuel (coal: 14), input (iron-ore: 2), and output (iron-plate: 10).\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n### Errors related to smelting timeout\n- Ensure that there is sufficient fuel and input materials available for the furnace to operate. Check the inventory and add more coal or iron-ore as needed.\n- Monitor the furnace's inventory regularly to prevent running out of necessary materials, which can lead to smelting timeouts.\n- Avoid repeatedly extracting materials from the furnace without replenishing input resources, as this can lead to smelting timeouts."}
