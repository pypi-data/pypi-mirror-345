{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -80.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest (position 41.5, -80.5) with an inventory containing 341 coal.\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 41.0, -82.0) with a fuel inventory and currently working status. It has a drop position at (41.5, -80.5) and is connected to the wooden chest.\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position -15.0, -50.0) with a fuel inventory containing 50 coal and a result inventory containing 100 iron plates. The furnace is currently not working due to no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n- **Errors when extracting items from the wooden chest**: \n  - Ensure that the quantity being extracted does not exceed the available inventory in the wooden chest. For example, attempts to extract 10, 20, 50 units of coal have failed due to insufficient amounts.\n  \n- **Errors when picking up the wooden chest**: \n  - Inventory is full. Clear space in the inventory before attempting to pick up the wooden chest.\n\n- **Errors when inserting coal into the burner mining drill**: \n  - Ensure that the burner mining drill has enough capacity to accept coal. If the drop position (the wooden chest) is full, the mining drill may not be able to continue mining.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- **Utility Functions Defined**:\n  - `extract_item(Prototype.Coal, wooden_chest, quantity)`: This function has failed multiple times due to insufficient coal in the wooden chest.\n  - `pickup_entity(Prototype.WoodenChest, Position(41.5, -80.5))`: This function has failed due to a full inventory.\n\n- **Important Variables Assigned**:\n  - `wooden_chest`: Type - Entity\n  - `coal`: Type - Integer\n  - `iron_plate`: Type - Integer\n  - `wood`: Type - Integer"}
