{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace (position (0.0, 0.0)) with a full inventory of coal (50/50) and producing iron plates (25 in inventory).\n\n### Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of:\n- Wooden Chest (position (-14.5, -48.5)) containing iron ore (606 in inventory).\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill (position (-15.0, -50.0)) which is out of fuel and has a warning indicating that the chest at drop position (-14.5, -48.5) is full.\n\n### Additional Wooden Chest at position (2.5, 0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Wooden Chest (position (2.5, 0.5)) containing iron ore (661) and iron plates (100).\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n- **Errors when inserting into a full inventory**\n  - Ensure that the target entity (e.g., furnace) has available space in its inventory before attempting to insert items. The Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) is full of coal, preventing the insertion of more coal.\n\n- **Errors when using extracting but being too far**\n  - Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items. The Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) is out of fuel and cannot continue mining until the chest at (-14.5, -48.5) is emptied.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions**\n  - `insert_item(prototype, target, quantity)`: This function has failed multiple times when trying to insert coal into the Stone Furnace due to the inventory being full.\n\n- **Important Variables**\n  - `furnace`: type `Furnace`\n  - `burner_mining_drill`: type `BurnerMiningDrill`\n  - `wooden_chest`: type `Chest`\n  - `inventory`: type `Inventory` (various types for different entities)"}
