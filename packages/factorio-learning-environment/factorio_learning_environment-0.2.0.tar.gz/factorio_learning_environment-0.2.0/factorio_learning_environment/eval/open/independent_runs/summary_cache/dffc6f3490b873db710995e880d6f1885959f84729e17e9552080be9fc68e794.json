{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Smelting System around (-45, -80)\nComplex smelting setup consisting of:\n- Two furnaces at (45.0, -80.0) and (47.0, -80.0), both fueled with coal\n- Input inserters:\n  - Burner inserter at (44.5, -82.5) picking up from (44.5, -83.5) and dropping at (44.5, -81.5)\n  - Burner inserter at (46.5, -82.5) picking up from (46.5, -83.5) and dropping at (46.5, -81.5)\n- Output inserters:\n  - Burner inserter at (44.5, -81.5) picking up from (44.5, -80.5) and dropping at (44.5, -82.5)\n  - Burner inserter at (46.5, -81.5) picking up from (46.5, -80.5) and dropping at (46.5, -82.5)\n- Belt system with some coal and iron ore being transported\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Collision Errors\n- Before placing entities, check if the target location is free from other entities\n- When placing inserters near belts and furnaces, ensure proper spacing and alignment\n- Consider removing interfering entities before placing new ones\n- Pay attention to the exact positioning coordinates - even small decimal differences can cause collisions\n\n### System Design Tips\n- Plan the complete layout including input/output paths before placing entities\n- Leave adequate space between components for inserters and belts\n- Consider the working radius of inserters when positioning them relative to furnaces and belts\n\nNAMESPACE\n\n### Functions\nNo explicit functions defined in the provided logs\n\n### Important Variables\n- output_inserter1: EntityReference (burner-inserter)\n- output_inserter2: EntityReference (burner-inserter)\n\n### System State Variables\n- Inventory contains:\n  - wooden-chest: 4\n  - transport-belt: 28\n  - burner-inserter: 4\n  - coal: 3297\n  - iron-ore: 49\n  - iron-plate: 503"}
