{"content": "The current setup still indicates that the boiler is not receiving water, as shown by the `NO_INPUT_FLUID` status. Let's troubleshoot and ensure the pipeline is correctly aligned and connected:\n\n### Troubleshooting Steps:\n\n1. **Verify Pipe Connections:**\n   - Ensure that the pipes are correctly aligned and connected between the Offshore Pump and the Boiler. The connection points must match the input and output positions.\n\n2. **Check Boiler Alignment:**\n   - The boiler's input should be aligned with the pipe output from the Offshore Pump. If the boiler's direction is incorrect, rotate it to ensure proper alignment.\n\n3. **Inspect Pipe Length:**\n   - Ensure that there are enough pipes to bridge the gap between the Offshore Pump and the Boiler. If necessary, craft additional pipes.\n\n4. **Re-evaluate Connection Points:**\n   - Double-check the connection points to ensure they are correctly linked. The boiler should have a pipe connected to its input point.\n\n### Code to Reassess and Realign:\n\n```python\n# Check if the pipe group is correctly aligned\npipe_group = get_entity(Prototype.PipeGroup, Position(x=-13.5, y=-4.5))\nif pipe_group:\n    print(f\"Pipe Group Status: {pipe_group.status}\")\n\n# Rotate the boiler if needed\nif boiler.status == EntityStatus.NO_INPUT_FLUID:\n    # Rotate the boiler to ensure alignment with the pipe\n    rotate_entity(boiler, Direction.RIGHT)  # Adjust direction as necessary\n    print(\"Rotated boiler to ensure alignment with the pipe.\")\n\n# Recheck the entities and their statuses\nentities = get_entities()\nprint(f\"Entities on the map after adjustments: {entities}\")\n```\n\n### Additional Tips:\n\n- **Visual Inspection:** In a real-world scenario, visually inspect the setup to ensure the pipes are visibly connected.\n- **Use Debugging Tools:** If available, use any debugging tools or overlays to highlight fluid connections and ensure they are correctly established.\n- **Incremental Adjustments:** Make small adjustments and test after each one to isolate the issue effectively.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the connection issue and ensure the boiler receives water from the Offshore Pump.", "summary_range": "[1-360]"}
