Welcome to the **Club-Based Player Explorer**! This dashboard allows you to explore player data from FIFA 23.  
Here's how to use it:  
1. **Select a Club:** Use the dropdown to choose a club (e.g., Paris Saint-Germain).  
2. **Set Minimum Overall Rating:** Use the slider to filter players by their overall rating.  
3. **Explore Data:** View the filtered players in the table, their locations on the map, and their strengths in the radar plot.
