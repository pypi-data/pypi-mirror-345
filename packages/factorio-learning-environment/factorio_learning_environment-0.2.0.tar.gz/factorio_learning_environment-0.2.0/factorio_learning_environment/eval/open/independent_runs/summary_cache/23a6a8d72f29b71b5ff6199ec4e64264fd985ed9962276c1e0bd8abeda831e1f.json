{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Extraction and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, y=-60.0) with fuel inventory containing coal. It is currently operational but has a warning indicating that the chest at the drop position is full.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (4.5, y=-58.5) containing iron ore. This chest is the drop point for the mining drill.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (-15.0, y=-48.0), (-13.0, y=-48.0), and (-11.0, y=-48.0) used for smelting iron ore into iron plates. The furnaces have varying statuses, with some indicating full output and others lacking ingredients.\n\n### Storage Area\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Multiple Wooden Chests** at various positions (e.g., 5.5, y=-60.5; 7.5, y=-60.5; etc.) storing iron plates and iron ore.\n- **Iron Chests** at positions (-3.5, y=-52.5) and (-6.5, y=-50.5) with significant iron plate storage.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Extracting from Chests\n- Ensure that the chest is not full before attempting to extract items. If the chest is full, empty it to continue operations.\n\n### Errors when Furnaces are Full or Lack Ingredients\n- Regularly check the output inventory of furnaces to prevent them from becoming full, which halts production.\n- Ensure a consistent supply of ingredients to the furnaces to maintain continuous operation.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- None defined in the logs provided.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `iron_ore`: int, representing the amount of iron ore extracted or attempted to be extracted.\n- `iron_plate`: int, representing the amount of iron plates stored in various chests.\n- `fuel_inventory`: dict, representing the fuel status of mining drills and furnaces."}
