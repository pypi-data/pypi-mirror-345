{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 41.0, -82.0) with fuel source full and warnings indicating the chest at drop position is full.\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position -15.0, -50.0) with no ingredients to smelt and a fuel inventory containing coal.\n\n### Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -80.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest (position 41.5, -80.5) containing coal.\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at position (-15.5, -50.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position -15.5, -50.5) and a furnace at position (-15.0, -50.0).\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n- **Errors when inserting items into the furnace**\n  - Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into the furnace. The error indicates that there was no iron ore available to insert.\n\n- **Errors when the furnace has no ingredients or fuel**\n  - Regularly check the status of the furnace to ensure it has both ingredients and fuel. If the furnace shows `EntityStatus.NO_INGREDIENTS` or `EntityStatus.NO_FUEL`, take action to provide the necessary resources.\n\n- **Errors when using extracting but being too far**\n  - Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n- **Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity**\n  - Ensure you can place an entity on a tile before attempting to place it.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions Defined:**\n  - `insert_item(Prototype.IronOre, furnace, quantity=4)`: This function failed due to insufficient iron ore in the inventory.\n\n- **Important Variables Assigned:**\n  - `furnace`: Entity (type: Furnace)\n  - `current_inventory`: Dictionary (type: Inventory) containing {'wood': 6, 'coal': 2920, 'iron-plate': 721}\n  - `nearest_iron_ore_position`: Tuple (type: Position) with values (-15.5, -50.5)"}
