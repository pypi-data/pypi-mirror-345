{"content": "The error indicates that crafting small electric poles failed due to a lack of wood, which is a raw resource that must be gathered manually. To resolve this, you need to gather wood from trees in the environment before crafting electric poles.\n\nHere\u2019s how you can proceed:\n\n1. **Gather Wood**: Locate and harvest wood from nearby trees.\n2. **Craft Electric Poles**: Once you have enough wood, craft the small electric poles needed for power distribution.\n3. **Place Electric Poles**: Set up the poles to power the inserters and ensure the factory is operational.\n\nLet's implement these steps:\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Locate and gather wood from trees\n# Assuming the function `nearest_tree` gives the position of the nearest tree\ntree_position = nearest_tree()\nmove_to(tree_position)\n\n# Harvest wood from the tree\ngathered_wood = harvest_resource(tree_position, resource_type=Resource.Wood, quantity=10)\nprint(f\"Gathered {gathered_wood} wood from nearby trees.\")\n\n# Step 2: Craft small electric poles using the gathered wood\ncraft_item(Prototype.SmallElectricPole, 5)\nprint(\"Crafted 5 Small Electric Poles for power distribution.\")\n\n# Step 3: Place electric poles to power the inserters\npole_positions = [Position(x=-14.0, y=24.0), Position(x=-13.0, y=24.0)]\nfor pole_position in pole_positions:\n    move_to(pole_position)\n    place_entity(Prototype.SmallElectricPole, position=pole_position)\n    print(f\"Placed electric pole at: {pole_position}\")\n\n# Verify inventory and entity status after setting up power\ninventory_after_power_setup = inspect_inventory()\nprint(f\"Inventory Status After Power Setup: {inventory_after_power_setup}\")\n\n# Check the status of all entities to ensure they are powered\nfactory_entities_with_power = get_entities()\nfor entity in factory_entities_with_power:\n    print(f\"Entity: {entity.name} at {entity.position}, status: {entity.status}\")\n```\n\nThis approach will ensure that you have the necessary resources to craft electric poles and power your factory setup.", "summary_range": "[1-154]"}
