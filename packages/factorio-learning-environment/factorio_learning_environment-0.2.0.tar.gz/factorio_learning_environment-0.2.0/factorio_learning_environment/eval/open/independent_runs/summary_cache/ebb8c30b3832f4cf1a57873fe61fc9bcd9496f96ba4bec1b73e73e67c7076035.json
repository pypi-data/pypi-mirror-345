The agent made several attempts to supply and craft a Lab for Automation Science Pack research; however, no Lab was placed because of inventory shortages and sub-ingredient deficits. In addition, while the agent referenced existing smelting furnaces during operations, these were not newly created structures. For example:\n\u2022 An iron smelting furnace at Position(x=5.0, y=5.0) was used to produce additional iron plates.\n\u2022 A copper smelting furnace at Position(x=-27.0, y=-60.0) was used to produce copper plates.\nTheir use is noted only as part of resource processing, but no structure has been added as a result of these steps.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 API Parameter Misuse (get_entities):\n  \u2013 Ensure the function is called with the correct parameter signature. In one case a keyword argument 'radius' was used unexpectedly, and later positional arguments were passed to a function that accepts none. Verify the API documentation before use.\n\n\u2022 Lab Placement and Inventory Verification:\n  \u2013 Check that the Lab item is present in inventory before attempting placement. The error \u201cCould not place lab at (0.5, 2.5), No lab in inventory\u201d indicates that a prior inventory verification is necessary.\n\n\u2022 Handling Null Returns in Entity Retrieval:\n  \u2013 When filtering retrieved labs, confirm that the returned value is not None (or default to an empty list) to avoid iteration errors such as \u201c\u2018NoneType\u2019 object is not iterable.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Crafting Resource Dependencies:\n  \u2013 Before crafting complex items (like a Lab), validate that all required sub-ingredients (e.g. iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, copper-cables) are sufficiently available. Address shortages by ensuring that smelting and crafting processes complete their production of these components.\n\n\u2022 Sequential Error Resolution:\n  \u2013 Resolve each sub-ingredient shortage in the correct order. For example, ensure iron plates and copper plates are produced first, followed by their derivative items, to meet all prerequisites for Lab crafting."}
