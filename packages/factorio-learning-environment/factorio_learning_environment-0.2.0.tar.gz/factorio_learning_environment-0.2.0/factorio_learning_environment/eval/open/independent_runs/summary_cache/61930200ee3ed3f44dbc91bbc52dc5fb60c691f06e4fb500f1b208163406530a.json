{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) extracting iron ore.\n- **Furnace 1** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0) processing iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Furnace 2** at position (x=-10.0, y=-48.0) processing iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter 1** at position (x=-14.5, y=-47.5) transferring iron ore to Furnace 1.\n- **Burner Inserter 2** at position (x=-11.5, y=-45.5) waiting for source items.\n- **Storage Chest** at position (x=-6.5, y=-48.5) containing 850 iron plates.\n- **Destination Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-46.5) containing 93 iron ore.\n\n### Coal Supply System\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) transferring coal to Furnace 1.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-8.5, y=-47.5) transferring coal to Furnace 2.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items without sufficient inventory\n- Ensure you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into an entity. For example, attempting to insert coal into a furnace without having coal in the inventory will result in an error.\n\n### Inserter waiting for source items\n- Check the supply chain to ensure that the inserters have access to the necessary source items. This may involve ensuring that the upstream processes are functioning correctly and supplying the required items.\n\n### Inserter waiting for space in destination\n- Ensure that the destination for the inserter is not full and can accept more items. This may involve managing the output inventory of furnaces or chests to prevent blockage.\n\n### Evaluating expansion opportunities\n- Regularly assess the current production and storage capabilities to identify opportunities for expansion. This can help in increasing efficiency and preventing bottlenecks in the production line."}
