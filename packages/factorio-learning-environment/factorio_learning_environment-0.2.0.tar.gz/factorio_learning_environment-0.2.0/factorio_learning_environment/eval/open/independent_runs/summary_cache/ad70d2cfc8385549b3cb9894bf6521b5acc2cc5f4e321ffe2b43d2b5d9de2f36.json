{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, -60.0) which is working and has a warning: \"chest at drop position is full. Empty the chest at (4.5, -58.5) to continue mining.\"\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (5.5, -60.5), (7.5, -60.5), (6.5, -60.5), (9.5, -60.5), (8.5, -60.5), and (4.5, -58.5) with the latter containing iron ore.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (-15.0, -48.0), (-13.0, -48.0), and (-11.0, -48.0). The furnace at (-15.0, -48.0) has warnings: \"no ingredients to smelt\" and \"furnace result is full.\" The furnaces at (-13.0, -48.0) and (-11.0, -48.0) are working.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Full Chest\n- Ensure that the chest at the drop position of the burner mining drill is emptied regularly to prevent mining interruptions.\n\n### Errors due to Lack of Ingredients in Furnaces\n- Regularly supply the furnaces with the necessary ingredients to maintain continuous production.\n- Monitor the furnace result inventory to ensure it does not become full, which can halt production.\n\n### Errors due to Lack of Fuel\n- Ensure a consistent supply of coal to the burner mining drill to avoid interruptions in mining operations.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions**: None defined.\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `wooden-chest`: int\n  - `coal`: int\n  - `iron-ore`: int\n  - `iron-plate`: int\n  - `iron-gear-wheel`: int"}
