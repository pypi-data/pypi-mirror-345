{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-13.5, 20.0)\nConsists of boiler (position -13.5, 20.0) and connected to steam engine (position -10.0, 0.0).\n\n### Lab at position(-17.5, 23.5)\nConnected to steam engine (position -10.0, 0.0).\n\n### Assembling machine at position(-21.5, 25.5)\nConnected to steam engine (position -10.0, 0.0).\n\n### Pipe groups\nConsists of the following entities:\n- PipeGroup (position -4.5, 21.5)\n- PipeGroup (position -4.5, 23.5)\n\n### Electric poles\nConsists of multiple small electric poles at various positions:\n- Small electric pole (position -15.5, 20.5)\n- Small electric pole (position -14.5, 20.5)\n- Small electric pole (position -14.5, 21.5)\n- Small electric pole (position -15.5, 21.5)\n\n### Furnaces\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace (position 5.0, -73.0)\n- Furnace (position -18.0, -49.0)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when removing electricity poles\n- Ensure that the electricity pole is not being referenced incorrectly. Check for any potential issues with the code that accesses the pole's properties.\n\n### Errors when placing boiler\n- Ensure that the target location is clear before placing the boiler. Check for any nearby entities that may block placement.\n\n### Errors when connecting entities\n- Verify that the entities being connected are compatible and within range. Ensure that the connection points are correctly identified.\n\n### Errors related to power supply\n- Ensure that all machines requiring electricity are connected to a power source. Check for any disconnections in the electric pole network."}
