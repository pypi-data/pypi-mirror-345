{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0)\n  - Status: WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION\n  - Warnings: Output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Drop position: (x=-16.5, y=-52.5)\n  - Resources: 39998 units of iron ore\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)\n  - Status: NO_INGREDIENTS\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Fuel: 14 units of coal\n  - Furnace result: 60 units of iron plate\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- **Transport Belt and Wooden Chest Placement**: Ensure that the desired location is free of other entities or obstructions before attempting to place a transport belt or wooden chest.\n- **Burner Inserter Placement**: Verify that the target tile is unoccupied and suitable for placing a burner inserter.\n  \n### Errors when moving entities\n- **Stone Furnace Movement**: Before moving a stone furnace, confirm that the target location is valid and that the furnace can be placed there. Ensure there is no existing entity occupying the target position.\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities\n- **Entity Retrieval**: When using `get_entity` to retrieve a stone furnace, ensure the specified position is accurate and that the entity exists at that location. Double-check the coordinates to prevent retrieval errors.\n\n### General Inventory Management\n- **Output Blockage**: Address warnings related to output blockage by ensuring there is a sink entity or storage available to accept the output from the mining drill.\n- **Ingredient Availability**: Ensure that the stone furnace has the necessary ingredients to smelt by providing the required resources."}
