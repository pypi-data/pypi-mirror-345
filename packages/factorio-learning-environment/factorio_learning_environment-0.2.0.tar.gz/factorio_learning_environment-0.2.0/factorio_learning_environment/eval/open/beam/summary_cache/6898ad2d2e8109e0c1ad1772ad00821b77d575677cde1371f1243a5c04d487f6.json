{"content": "# The error indicates that I cannot craft the transport belts directly because they require a specific crafting or smelting machine, which I have not set up. This is a common oversight when trying to craft items that need a machine instead of being able to craft them directly from the inventory.\n# \n# To craft transport belts, I need to use an assembly machine. Since I don't have one in my inventory, I will need to craft an assembly machine first.\n\n# Let's ensure I have the materials to craft an assembly machine. I will check my inventory for the required components:\n# - 1 iron gear wheel\n# - 1 iron plate\n# - 1 electronic circuit\n\n# I already have enough iron gear wheels and plates, but I need to check if I have electronic circuits. \n\n# Checking my inventory for electronic circuits.\ninventory = inspect_inventory()\nprint(f\"Current Inventory: {inventory}\")  # Displaying current inventory to check for electronic circuits.\n\n# If I have the electronic circuits, I will proceed to craft an assembly machine.
