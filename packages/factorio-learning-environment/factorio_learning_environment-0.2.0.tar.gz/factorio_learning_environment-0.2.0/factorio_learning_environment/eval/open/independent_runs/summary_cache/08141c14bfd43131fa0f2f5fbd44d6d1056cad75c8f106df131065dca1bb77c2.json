{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-18.5, 19.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position -18.5, 19.5), boiler (position -13.5, 20.0), and offshore pump (position -11.5, 26.5). The steam engine is currently not connected to a power network and has no input liquid, while the boiler is full and functioning.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(x)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position x1) and a furnace at position(y1)\n- Burner mining drill (position x2) and a furnace at position(y2)\n- Burner mining drill (position x3) and a furnace at position(y3)\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position x1) and a furnace at position(y1)\n- Assembling machine at position(z1) and inserter at position(a) that puts into assembling machine\n- Beltgroup (position) that connects the furnace at position y1 to assembling machine at position(z1)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting pipes\n- Ensure that the positions you are trying to connect with pipes are valid and accessible. Check for any obstacles or incorrect placements that may prevent the connection.\n\n### Errors when placing lab\n- Confirm that the selected position for placing the lab is not occupied by another entity. If multiple valid positions are available, choose one that is clear.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it. Check for existing structures that may block placement.\n\n### Errors with pipe placement assertions\n- Verify that the positions you are attempting to place pipes are not obstructed by other entities. Ensure that the pipe connections are feasible and that there is enough space for placement."}
