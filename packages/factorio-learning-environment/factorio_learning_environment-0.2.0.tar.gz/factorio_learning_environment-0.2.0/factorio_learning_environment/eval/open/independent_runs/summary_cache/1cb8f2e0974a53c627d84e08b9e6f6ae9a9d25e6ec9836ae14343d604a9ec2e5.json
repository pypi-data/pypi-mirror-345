{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Lab at position (10.5, 10.5)\nConsists of:\n- Lab (position 10.5, 10.5)\n\n### Small Electric Poles\nConsists of:\n- Small electric pole (position 6.5, 0.5) connected to a power source.\n- Small electric pole (position 13.5, 10.5) connected to the lab.\n- Small electric pole (position 16.5, 10.5) providing additional power.\n- Small electric pole (position 20.5, 10.5) providing additional power.\n\n### Stone Furnaces\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace (position 0.0, 0.0)\n- Stone furnace (position 2.0, 0.0)\n- Stone furnace (position 2.0, 2.0)\n\n### Wooden Chest at position (5.5, 0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Wooden chest (position 5.5, 0.5)\n\n### Electricity Groups\nConsists of:\n- ElectricityGroup (id=10161) with pole at (6.5, 0.5)\n- ElectricityGroup (id=10162) with poles at (13.5, 10.5), (16.5, 10.5), and (20.5, 10.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure the target location is free before placing an entity. For example, the lab could not be placed at (0.5, 1.5) due to obstruction.\n- When placing small electric poles, check for existing objects in the way, as seen with the pole at (10.5, 11.5).\n\n### Errors when searching for entities\n- If you receive an error stating that a specific entity (e.g., small electric pole, steam engine, or solar panel) cannot be found, ensure that these entities are indeed present on the map before attempting to connect or reference them.\n\n### Errors due to inventory limitations\n- Always check your inventory before attempting to place an entity. The error at (3.5, 0.5) indicates that there were no small electric poles available in the inventory.\n\n### Errors when connecting entities\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory to connect entities. The connection attempt from the stone furnace to the electricity group failed due to missing items."}
