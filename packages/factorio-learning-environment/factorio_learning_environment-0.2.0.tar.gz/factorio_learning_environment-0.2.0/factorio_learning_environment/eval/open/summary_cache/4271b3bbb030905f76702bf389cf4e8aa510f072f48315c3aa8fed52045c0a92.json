{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron ore mining and smelting structure at position around (17.5, 72.5)\nConsists of the following connected entities:\n- Electric mining drill at position (17.5, 72.5) facing down, currently powered but output blocked due to furnace belt blockage.\n- Stone furnace at position (18.0, 75.0) used for smelting iron ore, fueled with coal, currently working but with full output inventory.\n- Two wooden chests at positions (19.5, 75.5) and (21.5, 75.5), serving as storage for smelted iron plates.\n- Burner inserter at position (20.5, 75.5) with spacing=1, moving iron plates from furnace to first chest.\n- Additional wooden chest at (21.5, 77.5) placed to receive iron plates, with a burner inserter at (20.5, 77.5) feeding it.\n- Small electric pole at (15.5, 75.5) newly placed near furnace, connected to power network.\n- Burner inserter at (20.5, 75.5) fueled with coal, but one burner inserter at (20.5, 77.5) is out of fuel.\n- Output blockage warning at furnace belt drop position affecting mining drill operation.\n\nThis structure enables extraction, smelting, and staged storage of iron plates, with improved power connectivity and output handling, though some inserters require fuel and output belt blockage persists.\n\n### Steam power generation structure at position around (-9.5, -0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, -0.5) extracting water.\n- Boiler at position (-5.0, 2.5) fueled with coal, currently working.\n- Steam engine at position (0.5, 6.5) connected to boiler by pipes, currently working and generating power.\n- Small electric poles near boiler (-4.5, -0.5), steam engine (0.5, 3.5), and newly placed pole at (15.5, 75.5) connected to power network.\n\nThis structure reliably generates electricity from steam power, supplying the factory\u2019s electric network.\n\n### Iron gear wheel assembly structure at position around (25.5, 80.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine 2 placed at (25.5, 80.5), set to craft iron gear wheels but currently not connected to power network and missing iron plates.\n- Input burner inserter at (20.5, 77.5) feeding into the assembly area.\n- Output wooden chest at (25.5, 82.5) placed to receive assembling machine output.\n- Attempted placement of burner inserter next to assembling machine output chest failed due to tile occupation.\n\nThis structure is intended for iron gear wheel production but currently lacks power and sufficient input materials.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity placement conflicts due to occupied tiles\n- Multiple attempts to place small electric poles near steam engine and furnace failed due to existing entities occupying target tiles.\n- Attempted to place burner inserter next to assembling machine output chest failed because the chest occupied the tile.\n- To avoid these errors, always check tile occupancy before placement.\n- Increase spacing, change direction, or adjust reference position when placing entities near others to find free tiles.\n\n### Inserter inventory full or out of fuel issues\n- Failed to insert coal into burner inserter at (20.5, 75.5) because its inventory was full.\n- Another burner inserter at (20.5, 77.5) was out of fuel, causing it to stop working.\n- Ensure inserters have sufficient fuel and manage their inventories to avoid insertion failures.\n- Monitor inserter fuel levels and avoid overfilling inventories.\n\n### Crafting and recipe dependency errors\n- Failed to place assembling-machine-1 due to no assembling machine in inventory.\n- Failed to craft assembling-machine-1 because required iron plates could not be crafted without a crafting machine or furnace.\n- Assembling machine 2 at (25.5, 80.5) not connected to power network and missing iron plates, preventing crafting iron gear wheels.\n- To mitigate, ensure required crafting machines and materials are available before crafting.\n- Connect assembling machines to power network to enable operation.\n- Manage input materials to assembling machines to meet recipe requirements.\n\n### Output blockage and power connectivity warnings\n- Mining drill at (17.5, 72.5) reported \"furnace belt at drop position is blocked,\" causing output blockage.\n- Furnace output inventory was full, preventing further smelting output.\n- Assembling machine 2 not connected to power network, preventing operation.\n- Ensure output belts and chests are clear and properly connected to accept items.\n- Verify electric poles connect all machines to the power network to ensure operation.\n\nNAMESPACE\nNo user-defined functions have been defined by"}
