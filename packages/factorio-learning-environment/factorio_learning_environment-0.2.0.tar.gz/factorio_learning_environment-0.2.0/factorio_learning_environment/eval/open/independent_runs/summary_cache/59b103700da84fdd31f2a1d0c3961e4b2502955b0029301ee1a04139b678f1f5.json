Utilize nearest buildable area searches to confirm viable placement.\n\n\u2022 Connection and Fluid Compatibility Failures:\n\u2003\u2013 Several connection attempts using connect_entities failed because the fluid types at source and target did not match or extraneous fluids were present (e.g., failures involving positions (-4.5, 26.5) and source at (-3.5, 22.5)).\n\u2003\u2013 Ensure that connection points are free of interfering fluids and that the output\u2019s fluid type aligns with what the target expects. Reposition components when necessary to create an unobstructed, compatible connection.\n\n\u2022 Pipeline Extension and Repositioning Challenges:\n\u2003\u2013 Persistent failures to extend the steam pipeline led to manual bridging attempts and repositioning of the steam engine, yet connections still could not be established.\n\u2003\u2013 After repositioning major components (as with the steam engine moved to (2.5, 24.5)), confirm that the new locations provide a direct and clear connection path. Remove or avoid residual obstructions from earlier failed placements.\n\n\u2022 General Stabilization and Buildable Area Validation:\n\u2003\u2013 Repeated waiting intervals suggest that achieving network stabilization alone does not resolve placement issues.\n\u2003\u2013 Validate candidate locations rigorously before placement and allow for additional stabilization time only after confirming that the buildable area is truly clear of conflicts."}
