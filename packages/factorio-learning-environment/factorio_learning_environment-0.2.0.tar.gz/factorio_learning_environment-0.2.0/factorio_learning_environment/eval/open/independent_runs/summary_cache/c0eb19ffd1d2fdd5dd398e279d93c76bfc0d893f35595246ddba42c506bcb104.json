Verify that the connected chests contain the necessary materials.\n\n### No Iron Ore to Insert\n- Ensure that your inventory contains iron ore before attempting to transfer it to furnaces or chests. Regularly check and manage your inventory levels to prevent such issues.\n\n### Chest at Drop Position is Full\n- Regularly clear out chests that are used as drop points for mining drills to prevent them from becoming full and halting production."}
