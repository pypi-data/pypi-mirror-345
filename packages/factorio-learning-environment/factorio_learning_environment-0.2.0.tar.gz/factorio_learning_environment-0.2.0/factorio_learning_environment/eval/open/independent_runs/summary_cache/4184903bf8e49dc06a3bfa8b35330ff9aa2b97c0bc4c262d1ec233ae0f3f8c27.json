{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-1.5, 24.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (-1.5, 24.5)\n- Boiler at position (-5.5, 24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe Group connecting the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine with pipes at positions (-8.5, 23.5), (-9.5, 22.5), (-8.5, 22.5), (-7.5, 22.5), (-6.5, 22.5), and (-7.5, 23.5)\n- Small Electric Poles around the generator area, not successfully connected due to placement issues\n\n### Smelting Facility at Position (9.0, -64.0) and (6.0, -62.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (9.0, -64.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n- Stone Furnace at position (6.0, -62.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) not receiving electricity\n- Wooden Chest at position (7.5, -61.5) and (6.5, -59.5) storing iron plates\n\n### Research Lab at Position (unknown)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab with automation science packs but not receiving power\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities on Occupied Tiles\n- Ensure that the target tile is free from other entities before attempting to place a new entity. Remove any existing entities that may be blocking the placement.\n\n### Errors when Placing Pipes Overlapping Water\n- Avoid placing pipes on tiles overlapping water. Pipes cannot be placed on water tiles, so choose a different location for placement.\n\n### Errors in Connecting Electric Poles\n- Check for any blockages that might prevent the connection of electric poles. Ensure that there is a clear path for the connection and that poles are placed correctly within the network.\n\n### Errors with Power Connection\n- Ensure that all components of the power network are correctly placed and connected. Verify that there are no blockages or misplacements preventing the connection of power lines."}
