{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nNo structures have been successfully placed on the map as all attempts to place entities have failed. The map remains empty of any constructed structures.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure the target tile is unoccupied before attempting to place any entity. Many placement attempts failed due to occupied tiles.\n- Verify that the coordinates specified for placing entities are valid and within the buildable area of the map.\n- When placing entities like chests, furnaces, and inserters, ensure there is adequate space around them for proper functionality and connectivity.\n\n### Errors related to undefined variables\n- Ensure all variables, such as 'new_chest', are properly defined before use in automation scripts to avoid undefined variable errors.\n\n### Errors with building box size\n- When using building boxes, ensure the size is appropriate for the intended placement area. If a suitable place cannot be found, consider decreasing the size of the BuildingBox or using multiple smaller BuildingBoxes."}
