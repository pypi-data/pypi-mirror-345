{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Coal mining operation at position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of a BurnerMiningDrill at position (41.0, -82.0) and a BurnerInserter at position (39.5, -81.5) that is connected to the drill. The inserter has a pickup position at (39.5, -82.5) and a drop position at (39.5, -80.5). There is also a wooden chest at position (41.5, -83.5) that is likely used for storing the mined coal.\n\n### Iron plate production at position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of a Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) that is used for smelting iron ore into iron plates. The furnace has a fuel inventory containing coal and a furnace source inventory containing iron ore. The furnace result inventory contains iron plates.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n* **Inventory full errors**: Ensure that the inventory of the entity being inserted into is not full before attempting to insert items. This can be done by checking the entity's inventory capacity and the number of items being inserted.\n* **No items to insert errors**: Ensure that the agent has the required items in its inventory before attempting to insert them into an entity. This can be done by checking the agent's inventory for the required items.\n* **Output blocked by item on the ground errors**: Ensure that there is a sink entity in place to accept the output of a production entity. This can be done by placing a chest or other storage entity near the production entity.\n* **Furnace result is full warnings**: Ensure that the furnace result inventory is not full before attempting to smelt more items. This can be done by checking the furnace result inventory capacity and the number of items being smelted.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n* **Utility functions**:\n\t+ `insert_item`: Inserts items into an entity. Failure modes: inventory full, no items to insert. Success modes: items inserted successfully.\n\t+ `harvest_resource`: Harvests resources from the environment. Failure modes: nothing within reach to harvest. Success modes: resources harvested successfully.\n* **Important variables**:\n\t+ `coal`: The amount of coal in the agent's inventory. Type: integer.\n\t+ `iron_ore`: The amount of iron ore in the agent's inventory. Type: integer.\n\t+ `iron_plate`: The amount of iron plates in the agent's inventory. Type: integer.\n\t+ `entities`: A list of entities on the map. Type: list of Entity objects."}
