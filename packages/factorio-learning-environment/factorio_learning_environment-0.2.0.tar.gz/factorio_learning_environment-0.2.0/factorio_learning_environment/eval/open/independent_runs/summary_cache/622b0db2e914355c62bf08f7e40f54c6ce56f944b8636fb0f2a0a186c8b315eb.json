Regularly check and replenish your coal supply.\n\n### Warnings of Full Storage\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are full to ensure continuous operation of mining drills and inserters. This prevents stoppage due to lack of space for mined resources.\n\n### Electricity Network Issues\n- Connect steam engines to the power network to ensure they are operational. Ensure that all necessary connections are made and that there is a sufficient supply of steam.\n\n### Fluid System Connectivity\n- Ensure that all pipes are correctly connected to maintain fluid flow. Check for any disconnected pipes or missing connections that might hinder fluid transportation.\n\n### Inserter and Belt Connectivity\n- Verify that inserters and belts are correctly positioned to ensure smooth transfer of items between entities. Adjust positions if items are not being transferred as expected."}
