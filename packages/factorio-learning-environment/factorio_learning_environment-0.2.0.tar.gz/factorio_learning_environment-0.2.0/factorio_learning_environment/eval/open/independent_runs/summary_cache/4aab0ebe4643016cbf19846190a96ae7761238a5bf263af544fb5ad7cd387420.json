For example, attempting to place a pipe without having it in inventory resulted in an error.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient crafting materials\n- Verify you have enough materials before crafting. Attempting to craft pipes without sufficient iron plates led to an error.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
