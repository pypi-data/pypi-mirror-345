Repeated failures citing \"existing objects in the way\" imply that clearance routines need to be more effective.\n\n\u2022 API Data and Connection Validation:\n  - Validate that complete connection endpoint data is provided prior to invoking connection methods; errors indicating \"Insufficient data for connection attempt\" must be addressed by ensuring all necessary parameters are available.\n\n\u2022 Manual Belt Placement Routine Checks:\n  - Reassess manual placement routines to confirm that inventory updates, clearance operations, and positional parameters are properly synchronized. Consistent failures signal a need to review both distance calculations and obstruction checks before placement.\n"}
