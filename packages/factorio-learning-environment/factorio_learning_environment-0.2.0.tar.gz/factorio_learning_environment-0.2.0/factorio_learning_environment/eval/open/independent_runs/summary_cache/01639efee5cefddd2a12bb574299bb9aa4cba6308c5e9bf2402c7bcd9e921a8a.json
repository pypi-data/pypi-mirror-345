{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-20.0, -70.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -70.0) fueled with coal, currently lacking ingredients to smelt.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-18.0, -70.0) processing iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-20.5, -66.5) waiting for source items, connected to transport belts.\n- Transport Belt network connecting furnaces and inserters.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) processing iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5) transferring items.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-12.5, -54.5) storing iron ore.\n- Transport Belt network facilitating movement of resources.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining Facility at Position (-23.0, -68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) extracting copper ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-23.5, -69.5) storing copper ore.\n- Transport Belt network connecting mining drill to storage.\n\n### Coal Mining Facility at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) extracting coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5) storing coal.\n\n### Miscellaneous Storage\n- Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5) storing coal, iron ore, and iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (3.5, 0.5) currently empty.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Ingredients in Furnaces\n- Ensure that furnaces have a consistent supply of raw materials to avoid production halts. Consider setting up automated inserters or belts to maintain a steady input of resources.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Verify that inserters have access to source items by checking the connectivity and supply of input resources. Adjust the positioning or supply chain to resolve waiting issues.\n\n### Efficient Resource Management\n- Regularly check and manage inventory levels to prevent resource shortages or overflows, which can disrupt production lines."}
