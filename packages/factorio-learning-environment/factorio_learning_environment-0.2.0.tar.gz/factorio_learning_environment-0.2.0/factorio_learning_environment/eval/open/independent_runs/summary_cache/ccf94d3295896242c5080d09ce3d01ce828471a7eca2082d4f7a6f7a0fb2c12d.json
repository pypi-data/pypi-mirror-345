{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (x=-23.0, y=-68.0) connected to a stone furnace at position (x=-19.0, y=-65.0)\n- Burner inserter at position (x=-20.5, y=-66.5) transferring items from the mining drill to the furnace\n- Wooden chest at position (x=-24.5, y=-67.5) for storage\n- Belt group starting at position (x=-24.5, y=-69.5) and extending to position (x=-21.5, y=-64.5) for item transport\n\n### Copper Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0) connected to a stone furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\n- Burner inserter at position (x=2.5, y=0.5) transferring items from the furnace to a wooden chest at position (x=3.5, y=0.5)\n- Wooden chests at positions (x=1.5, y=0.5) and (x=-14.5, y=-54.5) for storage\n- Belt group at position (x=-14.5, y=-55.5) for item transport\n\n### Coal Mining Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (x=53.0, y=-83.0) with a wooden chest at position (x=52.5, y=-84.5) for storage\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placement. Remove any existing entities from the target position before placing a new one, as seen in the failed attempt to place a belt at position (x=-23.5, y=-69.5).\n\n### Errors with inserters waiting for source items\n- Verify that the source entities for inserters have the necessary items to transfer. The inserter at position (x=-20.5, y=-66.5) is waiting for source items, indicating a potential issue with the supply chain feeding into it."}
