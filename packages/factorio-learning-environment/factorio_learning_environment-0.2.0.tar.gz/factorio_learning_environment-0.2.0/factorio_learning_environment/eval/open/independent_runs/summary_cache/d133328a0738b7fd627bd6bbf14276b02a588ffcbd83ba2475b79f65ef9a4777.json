{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-11.5, 18.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position -11.5, 18.5), boiler (position -11.5, 25.0), and offshore pump (position -9.5, 24.5). The steam engine is currently not connected to the power network, and the boiler is also not connected.\n\n### Copper plate factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace (position 0.0, 0.0) with coal as fuel and currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n- Furnace (position 5.0, 5.0) with coal as fuel and currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n- Lab (position unknown) with no power and is set to research automation.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting entities to the power network\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to connect entities. In this case, small electric poles are needed to connect the boiler to the offshore pump.\n\n### Errors when crafting items\n- Gather raw resources (like wood) before attempting to craft items that require them. The recipe for wood must be available, and wood must be collected before crafting small electric poles.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
