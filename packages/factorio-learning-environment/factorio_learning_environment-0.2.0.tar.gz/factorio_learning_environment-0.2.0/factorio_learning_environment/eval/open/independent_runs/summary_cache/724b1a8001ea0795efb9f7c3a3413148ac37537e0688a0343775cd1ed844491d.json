{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-16.0, y=-49.0) with coal fuel and iron ore source, producing iron plates.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0) with coal fuel and iron ore source, producing iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-47.5) transferring items between the transport belt and the furnace.\n- Transport Belt network connecting the furnaces and inserters, facilitating the movement of resources.\n\n### Storage and Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=-13.5, y=-46.5) for temporary storage of items.\n- Iron Chest at position (x=-11.5, y=-44.5) for additional storage capacity.\n- Burner Inserters positioned strategically to move items between chests and belts.\n\n### Belt and Inserter Network\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Multiple Transport Belts positioned to connect various parts of the production line, ensuring smooth item flow.\n- Burner Inserters at various positions, such as (x=-14.5, y=-45.5) and (x=-13.5, y=-45.5), facilitating resource movement between belts and chests.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Insufficient Inventory\n- Ensure that you have enough resources in your inventory before attempting to supply items to structures. For example, make sure there is enough iron ore before trying to insert it into a furnace.\n\n### Errors when Inserters are Waiting for Source Items\n- Check that the source items are available and within reach of the inserters. Adjust the position of inserters or ensure that the supply chain is not interrupted.\n\n### Errors with Full Output in Furnaces\n- Regularly check the output inventory of furnaces to prevent them from becoming full, which can halt production. Use chests or additional belts to manage overflow.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the inserters are properly aligned and have access to the items they are supposed to move. Adjust the inserter's position or the belt direction if necessary."}
