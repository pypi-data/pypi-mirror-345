"""
Unit tests for rust binding test library

Run this test script to verify that functions can be compiled and run, and produce
expected results

n.b. The rust module needs to be compiled the first time this is run, but pytest will
hide the output of the rust compiler, so it may appear to hang for a little while.
Subsequent compilations should be much shorter
