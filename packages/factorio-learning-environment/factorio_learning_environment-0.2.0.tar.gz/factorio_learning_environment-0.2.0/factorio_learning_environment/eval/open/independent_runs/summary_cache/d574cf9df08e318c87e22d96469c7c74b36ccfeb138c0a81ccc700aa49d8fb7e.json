{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-11.5, 18.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position -11.5, 18.5), boiler (position -11.5, 25.0), and offshore pump (position -9.5, 24.5). The steam engine and boiler are currently not connected, while the offshore pump is operational.\n\n### Pipes layout around the boiler and steam engine\nConsists of the following pipe groups:\n- Pipe group (position -13.5, 20.5) - Status: EMPTY\n- Pipe group (position -9.5, 21.5) - Status: FULL_OUTPUT\n- Pipe group (position -11.5, 23.5) - Status: EMPTY\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when trying to connect boiler to steam engine\n- Ensure that the positions of the boiler and steam engine are aligned correctly for pipe connections. Verify that there are no obstacles in the way.\n\n### Errors when connecting offshore pump to boiler\n- Confirm that the offshore pump is within the effective range of the boiler and that there are no existing pipes obstructing the connection.\n\n### Errors when removing pipes\n- Make sure to remove pipes in a sequence that does not disrupt the existing connections. Check the layout before removal to avoid unnecessary disconnections.\n\n### General connection errors\n- Always inspect the current layout of entities before attempting to connect or disconnect. This helps in identifying potential issues with connections beforehand."}
