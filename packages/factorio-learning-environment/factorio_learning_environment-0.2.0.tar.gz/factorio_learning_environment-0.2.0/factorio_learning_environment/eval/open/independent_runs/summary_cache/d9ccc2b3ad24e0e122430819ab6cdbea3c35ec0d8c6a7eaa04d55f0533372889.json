{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-4.5, 23.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Boiler at position (-4.5, 23.0)\n- Small electric pole at position (-4.5, 21.5)\n- Small electric pole at position (-6.5, 23.5) (currently blocked)\n- Pipe connections surrounding the boiler for fluid transport\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied positions\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it. In this case, a small electric pole cannot be placed at (-6.5, 23.5) because another entity already exists there.\n\n### Errors related to boiler connections\n- The boiler is reporting warnings such as 'no input liquid' and 'no fluid present in connections'. Make sure to connect the boiler to a valid fluid source to avoid these warnings."}
