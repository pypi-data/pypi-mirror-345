{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Electricity generator at position(111.5, -32.0)\nConsists of boiler at position(111.5, -32.0) and offshore pump at position(106.5, -32.5)\n\n### NAMESPACE\n* Defined functions: \n  + connect_entities\n* Important variables: \n  + offshore_pump: Entity\n  + boiler: Entity\n  + Prototype.Pipe: Prototype\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n* Errors when using connect_entities function\n  - Ensure the correct number of arguments are passed to the function. The function takes 3 positional arguments: the two entities to connect and the prototype of the entity to use for connection.\n  - Ensure the positions of the entities are integers, as the function may not be able to handle float values.\n* Errors when accessing entity positions\n  - Ensure that the entity position is accessed correctly. The position of an entity is an attribute of the entity object, not a nested attribute. \n* Errors when using entity positions in functions\n  - Ensure that the entity positions are passed to functions in the correct format. Some functions may require integer positions, while others may be able to handle float values."}
