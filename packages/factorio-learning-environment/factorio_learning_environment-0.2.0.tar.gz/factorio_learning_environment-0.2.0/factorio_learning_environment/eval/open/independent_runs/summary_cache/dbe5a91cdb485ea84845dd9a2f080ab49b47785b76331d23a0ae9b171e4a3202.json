{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-10.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (-10.0, -50.0)\n- Burner Inserter at position (-10.5, -48.5) connected to the furnace\n- Wooden Chest at position (-8.5, -49.5)\n- Burner Inserter at position (-7.5, -49.5) connected to the wooden chest\n- Burner Inserter at position (-5.5, -49.5)\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Transport System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0)\n- BeltGroup connecting the mining drill to the furnace with belts at positions:\n  - Belt at position (-14.5, -54.5)\n  - Belt at position (-13.5, -54.5)\n  - Belt at position (-12.5, -54.5)\n  - Belt at position (-15.5, -52.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Belts to Stone Furnace\n- Ensure you use an inserter to connect belts to a stone furnace. Belts cannot be directly connected to a stone furnace.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Inventory Items\n- Before attempting to insert items into an entity, ensure you have the required items in your inventory.\n\n### Low Iron Plate Production\n- Investigate the production chain to identify bottlenecks or inefficiencies that may be causing low iron plate output. Consider checking fuel levels, inserter functionality, and resource availability."}
