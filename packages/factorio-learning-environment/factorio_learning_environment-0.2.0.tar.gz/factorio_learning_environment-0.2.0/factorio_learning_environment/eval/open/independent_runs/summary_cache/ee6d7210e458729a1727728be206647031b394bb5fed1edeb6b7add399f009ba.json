{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (8 units)\n  - Status: Working\n  - Warnings: Output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Neighbours: Stone Furnace\n  - Drop Position: (-16.5, -52.5)\n  - Resources: Iron Ore (40,000 units)\n- **Stone Furnace** at Position (-14.0, -49.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (14 units)\n  - Status: No Ingredients\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Furnace Result: Iron Plate (60 units)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied locations\n- Ensure that the target location is free of other entities before attempting to place a new entity. This includes checking for existing structures or items on the ground.\n\n### Errors when moving entities to occupied locations\n- Verify that the destination location is clear of other entities before moving an entity. This prevents conflicts and ensures smooth relocation.\n\n### Errors when connecting belts\n- When connecting belts, ensure that the path is clear and that belts are not being directly connected to non-compatible entities like Stone Furnaces. Use inserters to input items into furnaces.\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities\n- Double-check the position coordinates when attempting to retrieve an entity. Ensure that the entity type exists at the specified position to avoid retrieval errors."}
