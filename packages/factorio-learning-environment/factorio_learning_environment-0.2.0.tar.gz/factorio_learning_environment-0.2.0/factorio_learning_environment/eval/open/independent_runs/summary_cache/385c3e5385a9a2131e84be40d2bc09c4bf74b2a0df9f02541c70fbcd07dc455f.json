{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-46.5, -123.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-46.5, -123.5)\n- Boiler at position (-44.5, -124.0)\n- Pipe Group at position (-46.5, -122.5) connecting the offshore pump and boiler\n- Steam Engine at position (-40.5, -113.5)\n- Small Electric Poles around the steam engine for power distribution\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -76.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-15.5, -77.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-19.0, -73.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n- Stone Furnace at position (6.0, -62.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) not receiving electricity, intended to move items from the furnace to a Wooden Chest at position (6.5, -59.5)\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (9.0, -64.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n\n### Storage and Logistics\nConsists of:\n- Wooden Chest at position (7.5, -61.5) containing iron plates\n- Wooden Chest at position (6.5, -59.5) containing iron ore, iron plates, and copper plates\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Insufficient Inventory Items\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities. For example, attempting to insert coal into a drill without having coal in the inventory will result in an error.\n\n### Errors When Connecting Power Network\n- Verify that you have the necessary items, such as small electric poles, in your inventory before attempting to connect them to the power network. Failure to do so will prevent successful connections.\n\n### Errors Due to Misplaced or Unpowered Entities\n- Ensure that all entities, such as inserters and labs, are properly connected to the power network to avoid issues like \"not receiving electricity\" or \"no power.\" Check connections and ensure that power poles are correctly placed to supply electricity."}
