{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Copper plate mine at position (41.0, -80.0)\nConsists of following entities\n-  Burner mining drill (position (41.0, -82.0)) and a furnace at position (41.0, -80.0)\n-  Burner inserter (position (39.5, -79.5)) that puts into the furnace at position (41.0, -80.0)\n-  Belt group that connects the furnace at position (41.0, -80.0) to the burner mining drill at position (41.0, -82.0)\n\n### Copper plate mine at position (60.0, -60.0)\nConsists of following entities\n-  Furnace (position (60.0, -60.0))\n\n### Electricity generator at position (117.5, -30.5)\nConsists of \n-  Offshore pump (position (106.5, -32.5))\n-  Boiler (position (111.5, -32.0))\n-  Steam engine (position (117.5, -30.5))\n-  Small electric pole (position (115.5, -32.5))\n-  Pipe group that connects the offshore pump at position (106.5, -32.5) to the boiler at position (111.5, -32.0) and then to the steam engine at position (117.5, -30.5)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n### Errors when using connect_entities function\n-  Ensure that the correct number of arguments are passed to the connect_entities function. The function takes 3 positional arguments.\n-  Ensure that the positions passed to the connect_entities function are integers, not floats.\n\n### Errors when accessing entity attributes\n-  Ensure that the correct attribute is accessed for the entity. For example, the position attribute of an entity is accessed using entity.position, not entity.position.position.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n-  No utility functions have been defined by the agent.\n-  Important variables:\n  -  pump: entity\n  -  boiler: entity\n  -  steam_engine: entity\n  -  offshore_pump: entity\n  -  Prototype.Pipe: prototype\n  -  Prototype.SteamEngine: prototype\n  -  Position: class\n  -  Entity: class\n  -  Inventory: class\n  -  Direction: enum\n  -  EntityStatus: enum"}
