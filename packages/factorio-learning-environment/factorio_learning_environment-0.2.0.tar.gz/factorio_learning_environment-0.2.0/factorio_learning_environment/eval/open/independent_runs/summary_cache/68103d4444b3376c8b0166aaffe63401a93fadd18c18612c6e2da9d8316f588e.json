{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (x=53.0, y=-83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=53.0, y=-83.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=52.5, y=-84.5) for coal storage.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Transport System at Position (x=-23.0, y=-68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-23.0, y=-68.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=-23.5, y=-69.5) for copper ore storage.\n- Transport Belt network connecting the mining drill to various positions for ore transportation.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Transport System at Position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-14.0, y=-53.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-54.5) for iron ore storage.\n- Transport Belt network connecting the mining drill to various positions for ore transportation.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (x=0.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=1.5, y=0.5) for storing coal, iron ore, and iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=2.5, y=0.5) for transferring items between chests.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Stale Entity Data\n- Ensure that entity data is up-to-date before performing operations. Stale data can lead to unexpected behavior or errors.\n\n### Attribute Errors with BeltGroup Objects\n- Verify that the correct attributes are being accessed for each object type. BeltGroup objects do not have a 'prototype' attribute. Ensure you are using the correct methods and attributes for the specific object type.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Check that the source chest or entity has the required items for the inserter to transfer. Ensure that the inserter is correctly positioned and configured to pick up items from the source.\n\n### Out of Fuel Warnings\n- Regularly refuel burner mining drills and inserters to maintain continuous operation. Monitor fuel levels and automate refueling if possible.\n\n### No Ingredients to Smelt in Furnaces\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary raw materials to process. Check the input inventory and supply chain to prevent production halts.\n\n### Chest Full Warnings\n- Monitor chest inventories and ensure there is enough space for incoming items. Consider expanding storage capacity or automating item transfers to prevent overflow."}
