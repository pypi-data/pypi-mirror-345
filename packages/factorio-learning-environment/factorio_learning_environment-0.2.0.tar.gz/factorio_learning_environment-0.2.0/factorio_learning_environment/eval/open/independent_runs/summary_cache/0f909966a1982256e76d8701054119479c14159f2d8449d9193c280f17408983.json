It has been employed repeatedly for copper ore and iron ore smelting, with inserted ores being converted into copper plates and iron plates. The furnace remains at position (0.0, 0.0) and continues to serve as the central processing structure on the map.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 Repeated furnace output delays  \n  - When smelting copper ore or iron ore, verify fuel levels and furnace conditions to reduce the number of waiting attempts. Checking timing and ensuring sufficient fuel can help achieve the expected plate counts.\n\n\u2022 Crafting and research prerequisite issues  \n  - For assembling machine crafting, ensure that the relevant technology is unlocked before attempting production.  \n  - For automation research, maintain lab power and secure an adequate science pack supply to prevent research progress from stalling.\n\n\u2022 Misplaced or missing inventory items required for structure placement  \n  - Confirm that build prerequisite items, such as Lab components, are available in the inventory before attempting to place or power a structure."}
