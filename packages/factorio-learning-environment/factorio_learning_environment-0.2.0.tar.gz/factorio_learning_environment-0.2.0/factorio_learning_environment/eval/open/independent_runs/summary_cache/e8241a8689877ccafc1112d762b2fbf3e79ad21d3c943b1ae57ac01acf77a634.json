{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (19.5, -1.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (19.5, -1.5)\n- Boiler at Position (20.5, -4.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (22.5, -7.5)\n- Pipe network connecting these entities, including positions (18.5, -3.5), (19.5, -2.5), (20.5, -5.5), and others.\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (2.0, 0.0)\n\n### Copper Plate Mine at Position (5.0, 5.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (5.0, 5.0)\n\n### Fluid Transport System\n- PipeGroup at Position (4.5, -9.5) with fluid 'water'\n- PipeGroup at Position (19.5, -2.5) with fluid 'water'\n- Additional PipeGroups at various positions for fluid transport\n\n### Electricity Network\n- Small Electric Poles at multiple positions including (-2.5, 0.5), (-3.5, 0.5), and others, forming an electricity network with ID 5782.\n\n### Miscellaneous Structures\n- Lab at unspecified position, status: MISSING_SCIENCE_PACKS\n- Wooden Chest at Position (-3.5, 0.5)\n- Inserter at Position (-3.5, 1.5) connected to the electricity network\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Attribute Errors with PipeGroup\n- Ensure that the PipeGroup object is correctly accessed and manipulated. The 'fluid' attribute does not exist directly on PipeGroup; check for correct attribute usage.\n\n### Connection Errors with Pipes\n- Verify that all entities are correctly aligned and positioned before attempting to connect them with pipes. Ensure that there are no obstructions and that the entities are within the connection range.\n\n### Inserter Power Issues\n- Ensure that inserters are connected to a power source. Check the electricity network for any disconnected poles or insufficient power supply.\n\n### Boiler and Steam Engine Connection Issues\n- Ensure that boilers and steam engines are properly connected with pipes and that there is a continuous flow of water. Check for any missing pipes or incorrect connections that may prevent fluid flow."}
