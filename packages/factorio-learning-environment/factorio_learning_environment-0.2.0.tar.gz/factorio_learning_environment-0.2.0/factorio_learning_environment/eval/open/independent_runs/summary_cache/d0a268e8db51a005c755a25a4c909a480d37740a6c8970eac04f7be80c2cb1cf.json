{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, -60.0) with a drop position at (4.5, -58.5), extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (5.5, -60.5), (4.5, -58.5), (7.5, -60.5), (6.5, -60.5), (9.5, -60.5), and (8.5, -60.5) for storing extracted iron ore.\n- **Iron Chest** at position (-5.5, -50.5) for storing iron ore and iron plates.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (-15.0, -48.0), (-13.0, -48.0), and (-11.0, -48.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-14.5, -50.5), (-13.5, -50.5), (-12.5, -50.5), (-11.5, -50.5), (-10.5, -50.5), (-9.5, -50.5), (-8.5, -50.5), (-7.5, -50.5), and (-6.5, -50.5) for storing iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Full Chests\n- Ensure that chests used for storing resources are not full to prevent interruptions in mining and production processes. Regularly check and empty chests to maintain workflow efficiency.\n\n### Errors with Chest Warnings\n- Address warnings such as \"chest at drop position is full\" by clearing out the contents of the chest at the specified position to allow continuous operation of mining drills.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- None defined or invoked in the provided steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `iron_ore: int` - Represents the quantity of iron ore extracted and stored.\n- `iron_plate: int` - Represents the quantity of iron plates produced and stored.\n- `coal: int` - Represents the quantity of coal used as fuel for furnaces and mining drills.\n- `wood: int` - Represents the quantity of wood in the inventory.\n- `iron_gear_wheel: int` - Represents the quantity of iron gear wheels in the inventory."}
