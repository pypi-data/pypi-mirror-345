{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo new structures have been successfully placed on the map. Multiple attempts were made to supply a Lab at (0.5, 2.5), but none succeeded due to missing inventory and resource shortages. No other production facilities were newly created\u2014even though existing furnaces (such as one at (5.0, 5.0) for smelting iron and a copper furnace at (\u201327.0, \u201360.0)) were referenced in processing, they were not placed by the agent.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 API Call Errors with get_entities\n\u2003\u2013 Avoid passing unexpected keyword arguments (such as \u201cradius\u201d) or supplying positional parameters to a function that requires none. Verify the correct function signature before making calls.\n\u2022 Lab Placement Failures\n\u2003\u2013 Ensure that the required Lab item is available in inventory prior to attempting placement at a target position.\n\u2022 Handling NoneType in Entity Retrieval\n\u2003\u2013 Validate that entity-retrieval functions do not return None before iterating over results.\n\u2022 Lab Crafting Shortcomings\n\u2003\u2013 Confirm that all intermediary components (for example, iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, copper-cables) are available in sufficient quantities before attempting to craft a Lab. Check that upstream processes (such as smelting and prior crafting steps) have successfully produced these prerequisites."}
