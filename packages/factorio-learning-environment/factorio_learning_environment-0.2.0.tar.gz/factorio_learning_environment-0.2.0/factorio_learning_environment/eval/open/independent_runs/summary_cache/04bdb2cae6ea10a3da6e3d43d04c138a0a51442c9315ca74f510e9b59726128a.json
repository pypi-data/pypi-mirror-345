{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\nConsists of offshore pump (position -9.5, 24.5), boiler (position not specified), and steam engine (position not specified).\n\n### Copper plate factory at position (x=1.0, y=1.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace (position 1.0, 1.0) with fuel (coal) and producing copper plates.\n- Burner inserter (position 8.5, 1.5) that transfers items from the furnace to the lab.\n- Lab (position 6.5, 1.5) for research activities.\n\n### Storage chests\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest (position 3.5, 1.5) containing iron plates.\n- Wooden chest (position 3.5, 3.5) containing iron plates.\n- Wooden chest (position 3.5, 5.5) with no items.\n\n### Pipe network\nConsists of a pipe group (position not specified) that connects various pipes for fluid transport.\n\n### Electricity group\nConsists of multiple electric poles (positions not specified) providing power to nearby entities.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing electric poles\n- Ensure the target location for placing electric poles is clear of any obstructions, including other entities and unplaceable terrain (like water).\n\n### Errors when retrieving entities\n- Verify that the specified position has an entity of the type you are trying to retrieve. If the entity is not found, check if it has been removed or never existed at that position.\n\n### Repeated errors\n- The same issues with placing electric poles and retrieving the steam engine have been encountered multiple times. Addressing the obstructions before attempting to place poles and confirming entity positions will help mitigate these errors."}
