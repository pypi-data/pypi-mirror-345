{"content": "The attempt to load stone into the active furnace has once again yielded unexpected results:\n\n### Active Furnace Output Status:\n- The active furnace currently contains **3 pieces of stone**, indicating that only part of the intended input was successfully registered. This continues to suggest a recurring issue with the furnace's ability to fully recognize the input quantity.\n- The furnace status is **\"WORKING,\"** but it remains idle in terms of processing, as it still lacks the necessary amount of stone to initiate smelting.\n\n### Overall Inventory Overview:\n- **Current Inventory**:\n  - 4 pieces of stone furnaces\n  - 7 pieces of coal remaining\n  - 5 pieces of iron ore\n  - **1 piece of copper ore available.**\n  - **21 pieces of iron plates available.**\n\n### Observations:\n- The furnace has not registered the full **5 pieces of stone** that were intended for insertion, which is preventing it from engaging in the smelting process.\n- The Copper Ore remains unprocessed, highlighting an ongoing issue with the furnace's operational readiness.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Extract the Remaining Stone**: I will extract the **3 pieces of stone** currently in the furnace to reset its state.\n2. **Retry Loading Stone**: After extraction, I will attempt to load **2 pieces of stone** into the furnace again.\n3. **Insert Copper Ore**: Along with the stone, I will also include the **1 piece of Copper Ore** to engage the furnace in the smelting process.\n4. **Validate Smelting Operation**: Finally, I will verify that the furnace starts processing correctly.\n\nLet's proceed to extract the remaining stone from the active furnace. \n\"\"\"\n\n# Extract the remaining stone from the active furnace\nextract_item(Prototype.Stone, active_furnace, quantity=3)  # Extract the 3 pieces of stone currently in the active furnace\n\n# Check the inventory status of the furnace after extraction\nactive_furnace_status_after_extraction = inspect_inventory(active_furnace)  # Inspect the status after extraction\noverall_inventory_after_extraction = inspect_inventory()  # Check total inventory after extraction.\n\nprint(f\"Active Furnace inventory status after extracting stone: {active_furnace_status_after_extraction}\")  # Status of the furnace after extraction.\nprint(f\"Overall current inventory after extracting stone: {overall_inventory_after_extraction}\")  # Total after operations.\nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")  # Review entities displayed on the map.", "summary_range": "[1-366]"}
