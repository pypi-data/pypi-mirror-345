{"content": "Given the persistent issue with inserting coal into the furnace, let's try a different approach to ensure that the insertion logic is correctly executed. We'll add detailed logging to trace each step and verify that the insertion command is being executed properly.\n\n### Revised Approach\n\n1. **Verify Player Inventory**: Ensure the player has coal.\n2. **Identify and Reset Furnace**: Remove the existing furnace and place a new one.\n3. **Insert Coal**: Attempt to insert coal and log the process.\n4. **Verify Furnace Inventory**: Check the furnace inventory after insertion.\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Verify coal availability in the player's inventory\nplayer_inventory = inspect_inventory()\ncoal_available = player_inventory.get(Prototype.Coal, 0)\nassert coal_available > 0, \"Player lacks sufficient coal.\"\n\n# Step 2: Locate and reset the furnace\nfurnaces_nearby = get_entities({Prototype.StoneFurnace}, position=furnace_position, radius=1)\nassert furnaces_nearby, \"No furnace found at the specified position.\"\n\n# Handle the first furnace found\nfurnace = furnaces_nearby[0]\nprint(\"Furnace before reset:\", furnace)\n\n# Remove the existing furnace\npickup_entity(furnace)\nprint(\"Furnace removed for reset.\")\n\n# Place a new furnace\nnew_furnace = place_entity(Prototype.StoneFurnace, position=furnace_position)\nprint(\"New furnace placed:\", new_furnace)\n\n# Step 3: Attempt to insert coal\ntry:\n    print(\"Attempting to insert coal into the new furnace...\")\n    insertion_success = insert_item(Prototype.Coal, new_furnace, quantity=1)\n    print(\"Coal insertion success:\", insertion_success)\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(\"Error during coal insertion:\", e)\n\n# Step 4: Verify the furnace inventory\npost_insertion_inventory = inspect_inventory(new_furnace)\nprint(\"Furnace inventory after insertion attempt:\", post_insertion_inventory)\n\n# Assert that coal is present in the furnace\nassert post_insertion_inventory.get(Prototype.Coal, 0) > 0, \"Coal insertion did not reflect in the furnace inventory.\"\n\n# Final state of the player's inventory\nprint(\"Player inventory after insertion:\", inspect_inventory())\n\n# Check the current state of all entities\nprint(\"Current entities in the environment:\", get_entities())\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- **Ensure Coal Availability**: Double-check that coal is available in the player's inventory.\n- **Reset Furnace**: Completely reset the furnace by removing and replacing it.\n- **Log Insertion Process**: Log every step of the insertion process to trace any issues.\n- **Verify Inventory**: After attempting insertion, verify the furnace inventory to ensure coal is present.\n\nIf the issue persists, consider checking for any game-specific constraints or rules that might be affecting item insertion into the furnace.", "summary_range": "[1-126]"}
