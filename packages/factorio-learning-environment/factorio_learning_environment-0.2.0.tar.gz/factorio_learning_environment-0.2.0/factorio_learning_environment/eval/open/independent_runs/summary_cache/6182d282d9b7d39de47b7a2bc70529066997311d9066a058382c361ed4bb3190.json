Check the status of the electric poles and their connections before attempting to connect to other structures.\n\n### Errors when connecting to the stone furnace\n- Verify that the stone furnace is powered before attempting to connect. If it shows 'EntityStatus.NO_POWER', check the connections and ensure that the electric poles are functioning correctly.\n\n### Attribute errors in code\n- Review the code for correct attribute usage. For example, ensure that objects being accessed have the expected attributes (e.g., 'ElectricityGroup' should have a valid structure and not be treated as a list).\n\n### General placement errors\n- Make sure to check the placement of entities to avoid conflicts with existing structures or tiles. Ensure that the intended position is clear before placing new entities."}
