{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Setup at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and deposits it into the chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates, but currently not receiving iron ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Alignment and Fueling\n- Ensure the inserter is correctly aligned to transfer items from the chest to the furnace. Frequent repositioning indicates a need for consistent alignment.\n- Keep the inserter fueled to maintain continuous operation. Monitor fuel levels and refuel as necessary.\n\n### Errors with Furnace Operation\n- Verify that the furnace is receiving iron ore from the inserter. Check the inserter setup if the furnace is not receiving materials.\n\n### Errors with Resource Management\n- Ensure sufficient coal is available in the inventory for refueling mining drills and inserters. Gather coal as needed to maintain operations.\n\n### Errors in Crafting\n- Note that coal is a raw resource and cannot be crafted. It must be gathered directly from the environment. Avoid attempting to craft coal.\n\n### Errors with Chest Management\n- Regularly check and manage the chest inventory to prevent it from becoming full, which can halt mining operations. Extract items as necessary to free up space."}
