{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (4.0, y=-60.0) with a drop position at (4.5, y=-58.5).\n- Wooden Chests for storage at positions:\n  - (4.5, y=-58.5) containing iron ore.\n  - (5.5, y=-60.5), (6.5, y=-60.5), (7.5, y=-60.5), (8.5, y=-60.5), (9.5, y=-60.5) containing iron plates.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage Area\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chests at positions:\n  - (-4.5, y=-52.5) containing iron plates.\n  - (-5.5, y=-52.5) containing iron ore.\n  - (-6.5, y=-50.5), (-7.5, y=-50.5), (-8.5, y=-50.5), (-9.5, y=-50.5), (-10.5, y=-50.5), (-11.5, y=-50.5), (-12.5, y=-50.5), (-13.5, y=-50.5), (-14.5, y=-50.5) containing various amounts of iron plates.\n  - (-15.5, y=-49.5) recently added for excess iron plate storage.\n\n### Iron Smelting Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnaces at positions:\n  - (-15.0, y=-48.0), (-13.0, y=-48.0), (-11.0, y=-48.0) with warnings of no ingredients to smelt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inventory Management Errors\n- Ensure there is enough space in the inventory before attempting to extract items from chests. This will prevent repeated errors of \"Not enough space in inventory to extract iron ore from chest.\"\n\n### Chest Capacity Management\n- Before attempting to insert items into a chest, verify that the chest has sufficient capacity to accommodate the items. This will prevent errors such as \"Failed to insert iron-plate into wooden-chest\" due to full inventory.\n\n### Resource Allocation\n- Regularly monitor and manage the inventory of chests and furnaces to ensure efficient resource allocation and prevent warnings like \"chest is full\" or \"no ingredients to smelt.\"\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `wooden-chest`: int (count: 6)\n- `wood`: int (count: 22)\n- `iron-plate`: int (count: 5000)\n- `iron-gear-wheel`: int (count: 4)"}
