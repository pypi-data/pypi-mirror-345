For example, the error \"Could not insert: No coal to insert from your inventory\" indicates a lack of coal in the inventory when trying to refuel drills.\n\n### Errors When Inserters Are Waiting for Source Items\n- Check that the source entities (e.g., chests or drills) have items available for inserters to transfer. Inserters waiting for source items may indicate a blockage or empty source.\n\n### Warnings for Full Chests\n- Regularly empty chests that are at drop positions for drills to prevent mining operations from halting due to full storage.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `insert_item`: Attempts to insert a specified quantity of an item into a target entity. Ensure the item is available in the inventory before calling this function.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `coal_drill`: Represents a drill entity intended to be refueled with coal.\n- `iron_ore_drill`: Represents a drill entity intended to be refueled with coal.\n- `quantity`: Integer specifying the number of items to insert or extract."}
