{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll generate a new report:\n\n# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Transport System (around position 41,-82)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (41.0, -82.0) mining coal\n- Iron chest (41.5, -83.5) storing coal output\n- Wooden chest (41.5, -80.5) as intermediate storage\n- Burner inserter (42.5, -80.5) moving coal from wooden chest to transport belt\n- Transport belt system:\n  - Belt at (43.5, -80.5) pointing DOWN\n  - Belt at (43.5, -81.5) pointing RIGHT\n\n### Iron Smelting Area (around position 45,-81)\nConsists of:\n- Two stone furnaces:\n  - First furnace at (45.0, -81.0)\n  - Second furnace at (47.0, -81.0)\n- Wooden chest (49.5, -80.5) storing iron plates\n\n### Transport Belt Network\n- Main belt group running from (42.5, -68.5) to (42.5, -77.5) with 10 belts\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Conflicts\n- Before placing entities, verify the target location is clear of other entities\n- Common error when trying to place burner-inserter where other entities exist\n- Consider checking surrounding tiles for space before placement attempts\n\n### Entity Position Verification\n- Always verify entity existence before trying to interact with it\n- Use get_entity() calls with proper error handling\n- Multiple attempts to access non-existent inserters suggest need for better position tracking\n\n### Belt System Issues\n- Transport belt blockage causing upstream inserter waiting states\n- Ensure proper item flow by managing belt capacity and throughput\n- Clear blocked belts to maintain system operation\n\n# NAMESPACE\n\n### Important Variables\n- second_inserter: BurnerInserter\n- belt1, belt2: TransportBelt\n\n### System States\n- EntityStatus.WORKING: Seen on mining drill and belts\n- EntityStatus.WAITING_FOR_SPACE_IN_DESTINATION: Common on inserters\n- EntityStatus.NO_INGREDIENTS: Observed on furnaces\n- EntityStatus.NORMAL: Standard state for chests\n\n### Inventory States\n- Coal levels tracked across multiple entities\n- Iron plate production being monitored\n- Transport system inventory management"}
