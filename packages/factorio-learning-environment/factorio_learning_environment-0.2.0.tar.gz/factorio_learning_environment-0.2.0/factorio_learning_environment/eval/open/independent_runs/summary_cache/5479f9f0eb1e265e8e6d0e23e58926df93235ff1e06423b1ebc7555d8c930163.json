{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position (-0.5, -9.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam engine at position (-0.5, -9.5)\n- Boiler at position (-4.5, 23.0)\n- Offshore pump at position (-10.5, 25.5)\n- Multiple small electric poles providing power connectivity\n\n### Copper plate mine at position (0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill at position (0, 0) and a furnace at position (0, 0)\n- Burner mining drill at position (5, 5) and a furnace at position (5, 5)\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine at position (z1) and inserter at position (a) that puts into assembling machine\n- Beltgroup that connects the furnace at position (y1) to assembling machine at position (z1)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting entities\n- Ensure that there are no obstructing pipes or other entities between the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine when attempting to connect them. Clear any obstructions before reconnecting.\n\n### Errors when using electric networks\n- Verify that all electric poles are properly connected to the electricity network. Check the status of the poles and ensure they are not too far from the entities they are meant to power.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing. Check for existing entities in the target area.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items."}
