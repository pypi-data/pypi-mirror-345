Following several pipeline connection attempts, a candidate water pipe placed at (2.5, 19.5) was successfully merged with a water supply pipe from (2.5, 21.5) so that the boiler now achieves FULL_OUTPUT status with no warnings.\n- Steam Engine (position: 5.5, 5.5) \u2013 Generates electricity.\n\u2003\u2022 Remains NOT_CONNECTED, with unresolved issues linking it to the boiler\u2019s steam output.\n\n### Pipe Production Facility at position (3.5, 0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling Machine (position: 3.5, 0.5) \u2013 Configured for pipe crafting; warnings indicate it is not receiving electricity and is missing required iron-plate resources.\n- Iron Chest (position: 1.5, 0.5) \u2013 Stores crafted pipes.\n- Electricity Network: Small Electric Poles at (2.5, 2.5), (3.5, 2.5), (4.5, 3.5), (6.5, 0.5), (5.5, 0.5), (3.5, -2.5) and (3.5, -1.5). (Note: An attempted pole placement at (4.5, 0.5) failed due to an obstruction.)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 Raw Resource and Fuel Supply Errors\n\u2003- Avoid attempting to craft raw resources (e.g. coal); these must be harvested directly.\n\u2003- Verify that the required fuel is available in the inventory before attempting to insert it into boilers.\n\n\u2022 Water Pipeline Connection Issues\n\u2003- Ensure that target positions for water pipe placement are clear of existing entities; remove any interfering pipes before proceeding.\n\u2003- Confirm that the player is positioned within the maximum allowed placement distance when attempting to lay a new pipe.\n\u2003- Check that the configuration of source water pipes matches the boiler\u2019s input requirements to allow a valid connection.\n\n\u2022 Steam Network Connection Challenges\n\u2003- When linking the boiler\u2019s steam output to the steam engine, verify that neither connection point is obstructed.\n\u2003- Ensure that both entities are within a permissible range and that connection points align properly to allow fluid transfer.\n\n\u2022 General Pipeline and Placement Guidelines (from previous observations)\n\u2003- Always clear potential obstructions around connection points for both fluid and electric networks.\n\u2003- Use modular segments for long-distance connections and maintain sufficient resource levels during assembly."}
