(Example: 'python' was not defined)\n* Errors when inserting items into a furnace\n  - Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into a furnace. (Example: No iron-ore to insert into the furnace)\n* Errors when getting non-existent entities\n  - Ensure that the entity exists at the specified position before attempting to retrieve it. (Example: No entity of type steam-engine found at the specified position)\n* Errors when accessing empty lists\n  - Ensure that the list is not empty before attempting to access its elements. (Example: list index out of range)\n* Errors when entities are not powered\n  - Ensure that entities that require power are connected to a power source. (Example: Assembling machine status: EntityStatus.NO_POWER)\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n* Important variables:\n  - `coal` (int)\n  - `iron-ore` (int)\n  - `furnace` (Entity)\nNo utility functions have been defined by the agent."}
