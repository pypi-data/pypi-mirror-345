{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0): Extracts iron ore and deposits it into the adjacent chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5): Stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates but currently not receiving iron ore due to inserter setup issues.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Setup Errors\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items from the chest to the furnace. Frequent repositioning indicates potential misalignment or setup issues.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Ingredients\n- Verify that the inserter is operational and properly fueled to ensure consistent transfer of iron ore to the furnace. Regularly check and refuel the inserter to maintain functionality.\n\n### Chest Overflow\n- Regularly extract items from the chest to prevent overflow and ensure continuous operation of the mining drill. An overflowing chest can halt the mining process.\n\n### Inserter Fuel Management\n- Keep the inserter fueled with coal to prevent it from running out of fuel and stopping the transfer process. Regular checks and refueling are necessary to maintain continuous operation."}
