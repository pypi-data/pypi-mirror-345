{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nCurrently, there are no successfully placed structures on the map. The agent attempted to place wooden chests at various coordinates, but all placement attempts failed due to obstructions or errors. Consequently, no structures have been established.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using Position objects\n- Ensure that Position objects are used correctly. The error `TypeError: 'Position' object is not callable` indicates that a method was attempted to be called on a Position object incorrectly. Verify that you are accessing attributes or methods of Position objects properly.\n\n### Errors due to undefined functions\n- The error `NameError: name 'builtins' is not defined` suggests that there is a reference to a function or variable that is not defined. Make sure all functions and variables are properly defined and imported before use.\n\n### Errors when placing chests\n- Ensure that the target tile for placing chests is not occupied by another entity. The repeated failure to place chests at various coordinates indicates potential obstructions. Check for nearby entities before attempting placement and ensure the target location is clear.\n\n### Lack of resources\n- The message `No iron ore available to supply to furnaces` suggests a shortage of resources. Ensure a steady supply of necessary resources like iron ore to maintain production processes.\n\n### Errors when placing into occupied tiles\n- When attempting to place chests, ensure that the target location is not already occupied by other entities such as inserters or furnaces. Check the area for existing entities and choose a clear spot for placement."}
