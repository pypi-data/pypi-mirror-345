{"content": "The error indicates that crafting Small Electric Poles failed due to a lack of copper cables, which in turn require copper plates. This suggests that the copper plates have been used up or were not produced in sufficient quantity.\n\nTo resolve this, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Verify Copper Ore Availability**: Ensure there is enough copper ore to smelt into copper plates.\n2. **Smelt Copper Ore**: Insert copper ore into the furnace to produce copper plates.\n3. **Craft Copper Cables**: Once copper plates are available, craft copper cables.\n4. **Craft Electric Poles**: Use the copper cables and wood to craft Small Electric Poles.\n5. **Place Electric Poles**: Set up the poles to power the inserters.\n\nLet's proceed with these steps to ensure the necessary components are available for crafting and powering the setup.\n\n```python\n# Check if there is copper ore available in the inventory\ninventory = inspect_inventory()\ncopper_ore_available = inventory.get(Prototype.CopperOre, 0)\n\nif copper_ore_available > 0:\n    # Move to the furnace and insert copper ore for smelting\n    move_to(furnace_entity.position)\n    insert_item(Prototype.CopperOre, furnace_entity, quantity=copper_ore_available)\n    print(f\"Inserted {copper_ore_available} copper ore into the furnace for smelting.\")\n\n    # Wait for copper plates to be produced\n    for _ in range(30):\n        copper_plates_ready = inspect_inventory(furnace_entity).get(Prototype.CopperPlate, 0)\n        if copper_plates_ready >= 5:\n            break\n        sleep(1)\n\n    # Craft copper cables once copper plates are ready\n    if copper_plates_ready >= 5:\n        craft_item(Prototype.CopperCable, 5)\n        print(\"Crafted 5 Copper Cables successfully.\")\n\n        # Now craft small electric poles\n        craft_item(Prototype.SmallElectricPole, 5)\n        print(\"Crafted 5 Small Electric Poles for power distribution.\")\n\n        # Place the electric poles near the inserters to power them\n        pole_positions = [Position(x=-14.0, y=24.0), Position(x=-13.0, y=24.0)]\n        for pole_position in pole_positions:\n            move_to(pole_position)\n            place_entity(Prototype.SmallElectricPole, position=pole_position)\n            print(f\"Placed electric pole at: {pole_position}\")\n\nelse:\n    print(\"No copper ore available.
