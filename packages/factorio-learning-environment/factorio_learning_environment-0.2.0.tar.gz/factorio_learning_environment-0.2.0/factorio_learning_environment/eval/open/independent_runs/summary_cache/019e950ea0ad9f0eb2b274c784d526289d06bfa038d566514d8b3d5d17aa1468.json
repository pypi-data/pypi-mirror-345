{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Coal Mining and Storage System at position (x=42.0, y=-83.0)\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=42.0, y=-83.0) extracting coal.\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=45.0, y=-83.0) extracting coal.\n- **Chest** at position (x=42.5, y=-79.5) storing coal.\n- **Chest** at position (x=45.5, y=-79.5) storing coal.\n- **BeltGroup** connecting mining drills to chests:\n  - Input belts: (x=43.5, y=-81.5) \u2192 (x=41.5, y=-81.5) and (x=46.5, y=-81.5) \u2192 (x=44.5, y=-81.5).\n  - Output belts: (x=41.5, y=-81.5) \u2192 (x=41.5, y=-79.5) and (x=44.5, y=-81.5) \u2192 (x=44.5, y=-79.5).\n\n#### Iron Plate Smelting System at position (x=4.0, y=-60.0)\n- **Furnace** at position (x=4.0, y=-60.0) smelting iron plates.\n- **Furnace** at position (x=6.0, y=-60.0) smelting iron plates.\n- **Furnace** at position (x=8.0, y=-60.0) smelting iron plates.\n- **Chest** at position (x=10.5, y=-59.5) storing iron plates.\n- **Chest** at position (x=14.5, y=-59.5) storing iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserters** moving items between furnaces and chests:\n  - Inserter at (x=12.5, y=-59.5) moving items to chest at (x=14.5, y=-59.5).\n  - Inserter at (x=13.5, y=-59.5) moving items to chest at (x=14.5, y=-59.5).\n  - Inserter at (x=15.5, y=-59.5) moving items to chest at (x=16.5, y=-59.5).\n\n#### Additional Storage System at position (x=16.5, y=-79.5)\n- **Chest** at position (x=16.5, y=-79.5) for additional storage.\n- **Chest** at position (x=18.5, y=-79.5) for additional storage.\n\n---\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when inserting items without sufficient inventory\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities like furnaces or chests. For example, inserting iron ore into a furnace requires iron ore in your inventory.\n\n#### Errors when placing entities without sufficient inventory\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to place entities. For example, placing a wooden chest requires a wooden chest in your inventory.\n\n#### Errors due to blocked transport belts\n- Clear transport belts at drop positions to allow mining drills to continue operating. For example, clear the belt at (x=42.5, y=-81.5) and (x=45.5, y=-81.5) to resume coal mining.\n\n#### Errors due to full chests\n- Ensure chests have space before attempting to insert items. For example, the chest at (x=14.5, y=-59.5) is full and cannot accept more iron plates.\n\n#### Errors due to waiting for source items\n- Ensure inserters have access to source items before attempting to move them. For example, the inserter at (x=15.5, y=-59.5) is waiting for items to move to the chest at (x=16.5, y=-59.5)."}
