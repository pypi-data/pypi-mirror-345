{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Smelting Operation at position (-13.0, -50.0)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-13.0, -50.0): Used to smelt iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-11.5, -49.5): Transfers iron plates from the furnace to the chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-10.5, -49.5): Collects iron plates produced by the furnace.\n\n#### Smelting Operation at position (-13.0, -47.0)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-13.0, -47.0): Used to smelt iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-11.5, -46.5): Transfers iron plates from the furnace to the chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-10.5, -49.5): Collects iron plates produced by the furnace.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when placing entities in occupied tiles\n- Ensure the target tile is free before placing an entity. Use `place_entity_next_to` with appropriate spacing or direction to avoid conflicts with existing entities.\n\n#### Errors when extracting items from entities\n- Verify that the entity contains the desired item before attempting extraction. Ensure the smelting process is complete and the furnace has produced the item.\n\n#### Errors when inserting items into entities\n- Check your inventory for the required items before attempting to insert them into an entity. Ensure you have sufficient resources (e.g., coal, iron ore) in your inventory.\n\n#### Errors with inserter placement and rotation\n- Carefully plan the placement and rotation of inserters to ensure they can pick up and drop items correctly. Adjust spacing and direction to avoid conflicts with nearby entities.\n\n#### Errors with smelting timeout\n- Ensure the furnace has sufficient fuel and input materials (e.g., iron ore) before starting the smelting process. Monitor the furnace status to avoid timeouts."}
