{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Furnace Structure\n- **Stone Furnace**: Positioned at (x=0.0, y=0.0), fueled with coal, currently holding 50 units of coal. The furnace has produced 21 iron plates but is currently inactive due to no ingredients to smelt and a full fuel source.\n\n### Pipe System\n- **Pipe Group**: Located at position (x=-12.5, y=21.5), the pipe system is currently empty. It consists of pipes connecting the following coordinates: (x=-12.5, y=21.5), (x=-11.5, y=21.5), (x=-11.5, y=22.5), (x=-10.5, y=22.5), (x=-10.5, y=23.5), and (x=-9.5, y=23.5).\n\n### Electricity Network\n- **Electricity Group**: This network includes electric poles at various positions, such as (x=3.5, y=23.5), (x=-5.5, y=25.5), (x=0.5, y=24.5), and others. However, the network currently has a voltage of 0, indicating it is not operational.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Offshore Pump Placement\n- Ensure the offshore pump is placed at a suitable position near water. Verify that the selected tile is adjacent to a water source before attempting to place the pump.\n\n### Errors with Boiler and Steam Engine Placement\n- Check the terrain and ensure the selected position for placing boilers and steam engines is suitable and unoccupied. Avoid placing these entities on unsuitable or obstructed tiles.\n\n### Connection Errors between Offshore Pump and Boiler\n- Verify the alignment and connectivity of pipes between the offshore pump and boiler. Ensure that all pipe connections are correctly established and that there are no gaps or misalignments.\n\n### Electric Pole Connection Issues\n- Ensure that electric poles are placed within the connection range of each other. Verify that there are no obstacles preventing the connection between poles.\n\n### Errors in Move Command\n- When using move commands, ensure that the position arguments are correctly formatted as integers. Avoid using string indices for position arguments.\n\n### Errors in Picking Up Entities\n- When picking up entities, ensure that the second argument in the function is a valid Position object. Double-check the function call for correct argument types."}
