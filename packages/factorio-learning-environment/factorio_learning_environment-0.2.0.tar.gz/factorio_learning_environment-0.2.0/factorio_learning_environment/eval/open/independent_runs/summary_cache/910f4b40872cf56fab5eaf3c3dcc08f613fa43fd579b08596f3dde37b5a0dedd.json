Verify the availability of pipes in the inventory and ensure they are placed at the correct coordinates.\n\n### Boiler Connection Errors\n- Make sure the boiler is properly connected to the water source. Check that all necessary pipes are in place and connected to the offshore pump.\n\n### Power Connection Issues\n- Verify that all entities requiring power are connected to the electricity network. Ensure that small electric poles are properly placed and connected to provide power to inserters and the lab.\n\n### Inserter Power Issues\n- Ensure that inserters are connected to a power source. Check the placement of electric poles to confirm they are within range to supply power to inserters.\n\n### Furnace Ingredient Errors\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Check the inventory and supply chain to confirm that the required resources are being delivered to the furnaces."}
