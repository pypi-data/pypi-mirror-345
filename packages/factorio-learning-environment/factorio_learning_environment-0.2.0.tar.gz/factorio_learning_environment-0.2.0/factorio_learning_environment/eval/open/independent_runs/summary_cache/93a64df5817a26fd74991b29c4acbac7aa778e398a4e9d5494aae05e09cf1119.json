consider underground pipelines or pipe-to-ground modules; ensure connection points are unobstructed.\n\n\u2022 Entity Placement and Collision Issues  \n\u2003\u2013 Numerous pipe groups and interfering entities cause collisions when attempting placements in candidate directions with varied spacings.  \n\u2003\u2013 Mitigation: Verify that target tiles are unoccupied and maintain sufficient separation between entities.\n\n\u2022 Fuel, Resource, and Power Supply Shortfalls  \n\u2003\u2013 Multiple production units (drills, inserters, furnaces, assembling machines) face issues like out-of-fuel, missing inputs, or lack of electricity.  \n\u2003\u2013 Mitigation: Regularly replenish required fuels and ingredients;

review and correct the approach for position computations."}
