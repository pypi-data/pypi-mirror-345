{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-10.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-10.0, -50.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-10.5, -48.5) for transferring items into the stone furnace.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-8.5, -49.5) for storing iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-7.5, -49.5) for transferring items from the wooden chest.\n\n### Conveyor Belt System\nConsists of several BeltGroups:\n- BeltGroup with inputs from (x=-15.5, y=-54.5) to (x=-13.5, y=-54.5) and outputs from (x=-12.5, y=-54.5) to (x=-10.5, y=-54.5).\n- BeltGroup with inputs from (x=-21.5, y=-51.5) to (x=-19.5, y=-51.5) and outputs from (x=-15.5, y=-51.5) to (x=-15.5, y=-53.5).\n- BeltGroup with inputs from (x=-14.5, y=-50.5) to (x=-16.5, y=-50.5) and outputs from (x=-16.5, y=-55.5) to (x=-14.5, y=-55.5).\n- BeltGroup with inputs from (x=-9.5, y=-50.5) to (x=-9.5, y=-52.5) and outputs from (x=-9.5, y=-53.5) to (x=-9.5, y=-55.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Iron Plate Production Issues\n- Ensure that the stone furnace has both fuel and ingredients to smelt. The furnace is currently out of fuel and lacks ingredients, leading to low production.\n\n### Errors when Extracting Items\n- Ensure that the target entity, such as a wooden chest, contains the items you intend to extract. The error occurred when attempting to extract iron ore from a chest that did not contain it.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Make sure that the inserters have access to source items. The inserters are currently waiting for source items, which may indicate a supply chain issue."}
