{"content": "The repeated attempts to connect the assembling machine to a power source have not been successful. The assembling machine remains without power, as indicated by the \"NO_POWER\" status and the warning \"not connected to power network.\" Here are some suggestions to address this issue:\n\n### Troubleshooting Steps:\n\n1. **Verify Pole Placement:**\n   - Ensure the electric pole is placed within the effective range of the assembling machine. The pole should be close enough to cover the machine's power needs.\n\n2. **Check Power Source:**\n   - Confirm that the electric pole itself is connected to a power source. If there is no power generation (e.g., steam engine, solar panel) connected to the pole, it will not supply power to the machine.\n\n3. **Inspect Power Network:**\n   - Use the `inspect_power_network()` function to check if the pole is part of a connected power network. This can help identify if there are any breaks in the power grid.\n\n4. **Reposition and Reconnect:**\n   - Try repositioning the pole slightly closer to the assembling machine and ensure there are no obstructions.\n   - Use `connect_entities()` to explicitly connect the pole to the assembling machine.\n\n5. **Debugging:**\n   - Print the status of the power network and entities to verify connections.\n   - Use `inspect_entity()` on the electric pole to ensure it has power.\n\n### Example Code for Power Network Inspection:\n```python\n# Check the power network status\ntry:\n    power_network_status = inspect_power_network()\n    print(\"Power Network Status:\", power_network_status)\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"Error inspecting power network: {e}\")\n\n# Inspect the electric pole to ensure it is powered\ntry:\n    pole_status = inspect_entity(new_pole)\n    print(\"Electric Pole Status:\", pole_status)\nexcept Exception as e:\n    print(f\"Error inspecting electric pole: {e}\")\n```\n\n### Additional Tips:\n- Ensure that the electric pole is not only placed but also connected to a power-producing entity.\n- Verify that the assembling machine's position is within the coverage area of the electric pole.\n- If the power network is complex, ensure there are no disconnected segments.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to diagnose and resolve the power connectivity issue for the assembling machine.", "summary_range": "[1-116]"}
