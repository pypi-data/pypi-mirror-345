{"content": "Based on the execution logs and entity data, here's the updated report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of three stone furnaces in a row:\n- Furnace 1 at position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Furnace 2 at position (2.0, 0.0)\n- Furnace 3 at position (4.0, 4.0)\nAll furnaces are working and processing copper ore into copper plates\n\n### Storage System\nSeries of wooden chests storing various materials:\n- Chest at (6.5, 11.5) storing iron plates (1161)\n- Chest at (12.5, 11.5) storing mixed materials (iron plates, copper plates, electronic circuits)\n- Chest at (14.5, 11.5) storing iron plates (full - 1600)\n- Chest at (16.5, 11.5) storing copper plates (850)\n\n### Copper Cable Assembly Line\nLocated around position (9.5, 11.5), consists of:\n- Assembling machine for producing copper cables\n- Two burner inserters at (7.5, 11.5) and (11.5, 11.5) for input/output\n- Connected to storage chests on both sides\n\n### Power Generation System\nLocated around y-position 24.5, consists of:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Boiler at (-7.0, 24.5)\n- Steam engine at (-2.5, 24.5)\n- Connected pipe network for water and steam transport\n- Electric pole network connecting various structures\n\n### Science Pack System\nLocated at the southern part of the facility:\n- Lab with automation and logistic science pack inputs\n- Burner inserter at (0.5, 30.5)\n- Storage chest at (0.5, 31.5) containing science packs\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Power Supply Issues\n- Ensure boiler has constant fuel supply - multiple instances of boiler running out of fuel\n- Steam engine showing \"not connected to power network\" - verify electrical connections\n\n### Assembly Machine Issues\n- Assembly machine showing \"not receiving electricity\" - check power pole connections\n- Unable to extract copper cable from assembly machine - ensure required resources (copper plates) are available and machine is powered\n\n### Resource Management\n- Monitor coal levels closely - multiple instances of attempting to insert coal when inventory is empty\n- Keep track of furnace fuel levels to maintain continuous operation\n\n### Storage Management\n- One storage chest is completely full (iron plates) - consider adding more storage or better distribution\n- Monitor chest contents to prevent overflow situations"}
