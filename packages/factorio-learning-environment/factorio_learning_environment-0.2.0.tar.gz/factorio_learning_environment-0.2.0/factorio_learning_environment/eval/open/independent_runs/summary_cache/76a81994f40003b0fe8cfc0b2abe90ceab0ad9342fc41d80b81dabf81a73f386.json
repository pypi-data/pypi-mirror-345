{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo new structures have been successfully placed on the map during these execution steps. The agent repeatedly attempted to locate, craft, and place a Lab at (0.5, 2.5) to supply Automation Science Packs for research. All such attempts have failed because the required Lab item was missing and the necessary sub-ingredients were not available. In parallel, the agent referenced pre\u2010existing furnace entities (an iron furnace at Position(x=5.0, y=5.0) used for smelting iron ore into iron plates and a copper furnace at Position(x=-27.0, y=-60.0) used for smelting copper ore into copper plates). These furnaces were simply utilized for processing raw materials rather than newly constructed.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 API Usage Errors\n\u2003\u2013 Incorrectly calling get_entities with unsupported keyword arguments (e.g. using \u201cradius\u201d) or extra positional arguments caused type errors. Use the correct function signature and pass only supported arguments.\n\n\u2022 Inventory and Placement Issues\n\u2003\u2013 Attempts to place a Lab failed because no Lab item was available in the inventory. Verify resource availability before initiating placement.\n\n\u2022 Null Iteration Problems\n\u2003\u2013 Iterating over the result of get_entities without checking for a None value produced errors. Always validate that the returned value is iterable.\n\n\u2022 Crafting and Dependency Shortfalls\n\u2003\u2013 Lab crafting errors arose from missing sub-ingredients such as iron-gear-wheels and electronic-circuits (which themselves require sufficient iron-plates, copper-plates, and copper-cables). Ensure that every item in the production chain is available in the required quantities before attempting complex recipes."}
