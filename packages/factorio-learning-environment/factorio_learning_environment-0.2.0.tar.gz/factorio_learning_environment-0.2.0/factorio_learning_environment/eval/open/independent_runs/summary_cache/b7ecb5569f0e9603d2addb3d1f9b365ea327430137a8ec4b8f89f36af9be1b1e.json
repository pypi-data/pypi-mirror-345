{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnace** at position (x=-16.0, y=-49.0) fueled by coal, currently full with iron plates.\n- **Furnace** at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0) fueled by coal, actively working with iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-47.5), waiting for source items, connected to the furnace at (x=-14.0, y=-49.0).\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-47.5), working and connected to the furnace at (x=-14.0, y=-49.0).\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-13.5, y=-46.5), used for storage.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-14.5, y=-45.5), waiting for source items, connected to transport belts and a wooden chest.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-45.5), waiting for source items, connected to transport belts and a wooden chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-13.5, y=-44.5), storing iron ore and iron plates.\n- **Iron Chest** at position (x=-11.5, y=-44.5), used for storage.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-11.5, y=-45.5), waiting for source items, connected to transport belts and an iron chest.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-9.5, y=-44.5), waiting for source items, connected to transport belts.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-14.5, y=-43.5), waiting for source items, connected to transport belts and a wooden chest.\n\n### Transport Belt Network\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **BeltGroup** with inputs from (x=-11.5, y=-46.5) to (x=-9.5, y=-46.5) and outputs from (x=-8.5, y=-45.5) to (x=-8.5, y=-43.5).\n- **BeltGroup** with inputs from (x=-12.5, y=-44.5) to (x=-12.5, y=-46.5) and outputs from (x=-12.5, y=-45.5) to (x=-11.5, y=-46.5).\n- **Individual Belts** connecting various positions, including (x=-16.5, y=-48.5) to (x=-16.5, y=-46.5), (x=-14.5, y=-45.5) to (x=-14.5, y=-47.5), and (x=-14.5, y=-45.5) to (x=-14.5, y=-43.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the inserters have access to the source items they are supposed to pick up. Check if the source items are available and within reach of the inserters.\n\n### Errors with Full Output in Furnaces\n- Regularly check the output slots of furnaces to ensure they are not full. Consider using inserters to automatically remove items from the furnace output to prevent production halts."}
