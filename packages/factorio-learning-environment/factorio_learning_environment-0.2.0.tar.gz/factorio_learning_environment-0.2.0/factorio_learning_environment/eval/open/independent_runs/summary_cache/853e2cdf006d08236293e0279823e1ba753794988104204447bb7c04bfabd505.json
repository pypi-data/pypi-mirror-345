{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Two stone furnaces located at positions (0.0, 0.0) and (2.0, 0.0).\n  - Each furnace is fueled with coal and is currently producing iron plates.\n  - The furnaces have a status indicating \"no ingredients to smelt\" at times, suggesting intermittent supply issues.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Resources\n- Ensure a consistent supply of iron ore and coal to the furnaces to maintain continuous production. Regularly check inventory levels and replenish resources as needed.\n\n### Errors When Placing Chests\n- Before attempting to place a chest, verify that the target tile is unoccupied. If placement fails, consider repositioning or removing obstructing entities.\n\n### Errors When Placing Transport Belts\n- Check the target area for obstructions before placing transport belts. Ensure there is a clear path and sufficient space for the belts to be placed.\n\n### Errors When Placing Inserters\n- Verify that the target location for inserters is free from obstructions. If placement fails, inspect the area for any entities that might be blocking the intended position."}
