{"content": "**EXISTING STRUCTURES**\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=41.0, y=-80.0)\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0) connected to a Stone Furnace at position (x=-20.0, y=-71.0)\n\n### Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=43.5, y=-79.5)\n\n**ERROR TIPS**\n\n### Errors due to insufficient inventory\n- Ensure that there is enough coal in the inventory before attempting to insert it into furnaces or drills. This will prevent errors like \"Could not insert: No coal to insert from your inventory.\"\n\n### Errors when entities run out of fuel\n- Regularly check and refuel entities such as Burner Mining Drills and Stone Furnaces to prevent them from running out of fuel and halting production.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\n- No utility functions have been defined by the agent in the given steps.\n- Important variables:\n  - `iron_furnace`: Represents the iron furnace entity.\n  - `copper_furnace`: Represents the copper furnace entity.\n  - Inventory variables such as `coal`, `iron-plate`, and `copper-plate` are tracked for resource management."}
