{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (0.0, 0.0) and (2.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with 4 units of iron ore and 87 iron plates.\n- Stone Furnace at position (2.0, 0.0) with 5 units of iron ore and 86 iron plates.\n\n### Coal Mining and Distribution System at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) with 7 units of coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (41.5, -83.5) with 1 unit of coal, connected to a wooden chest at position (40.5, -83.5) and another wooden chest at position (42.5, -83.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (40.5, -83.5) and another at position (42.5, -83.5) with 8 units of coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (41.5, -80.5) with 1 unit of coal, connected to a wooden chest at position (41.5, -79.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -79.5) with 716 units of coal.\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (42.5, -83.5) to (45.5, -83.5) with 8 units of coal.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entity has available items for the inserter to pick up. This can be achieved by checking the inventory of the source entity and ensuring it is not empty.\n\n### Refueling Errors\n- Regularly check the fuel levels of burner entities to ensure they have enough fuel to operate continuously. Refuel them before they run out to avoid production halts."}
