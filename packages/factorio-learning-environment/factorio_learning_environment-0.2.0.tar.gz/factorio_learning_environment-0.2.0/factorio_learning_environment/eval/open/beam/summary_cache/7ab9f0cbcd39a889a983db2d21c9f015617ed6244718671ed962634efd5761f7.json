{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron and Copper Smelting Facility at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\n  - Currently contains 8 units of coal as fuel.\n  - Furnace result inventory includes 2 iron plates.\n  - Warnings indicate no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Iron Plate Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Inserter at position (1.5, 0.5) transferring iron plates from the furnace to a wooden chest.\n  - Status: Not receiving electricity.\n- Wooden Chest at position (2.5, 0.5)\n  - Currently empty.\n\n### Offshore Pump Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n  - Warnings indicate no fluid present in connections.\n- Offshore Pump at position (-7.5, 25.5)\n  - Warnings indicate no fluid present in connections.\n\n### Electricity Group\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Small Electric Pole at position (1.5, 1.5)\n  - Voltage: 0 (Not supplying power).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Extracting Items from Furnace\n- Verify that the furnace contains the desired items before attempting extraction. Multiple errors occurred when trying to extract copper plates from a furnace that did not contain the specified quantity.\n\n### Errors due to Insufficient Resources for Crafting\n- Ensure you have the required resources before attempting to craft items. For instance, crafting a furnace requires stone, and crafting an inserter requires sub-ingredients like electronic circuits and copper plates.\n\n### Errors in Crafting Sub-Ingredients\n- When crafting complex items, ensure all sub-ingredients are available. For example, crafting an inserter failed due to missing electronic circuits, which in turn required copper cables and copper plates. Ensure you have the necessary crafting machines or furnaces to produce these sub-ingredients.\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities without Inventory\n- Ensure the required entity is in your inventory before attempting to place it. For example, attempts to place a wooden chest and offshore pump failed due to these items not being in the inventory.\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities on Occupied Tiles\n- Ensure you can place an entity on a tile before attempting placement. For example, placing a small electric pole failed due to an existing object in the way.\n\n### Errors when Crafting Items with Missing Raw Resources\n- Gather necessary raw resources before crafting. For instance, crafting a wooden chest failed due to the absence of wood, which is a raw resource that must be gathered.\n\n### Errors in Powering Entities\n- Ensure that power sources are connected and functioning. The inserter is not receiving electricity because the electric pole is not supplying power. Additionally, ensure that power sources like steam engines are available and connected.\n\n### Errors when Placing Boiler on Water\n- Avoid placing boilers on water tiles. Multiple attempts to place a boiler failed due to the entity footprint overlapping water. Choose a different location on land for placement.\n\n### Errors in Using Undefined Functions\n- Ensure that all functions used in the code are defined. An error occurred due to the use of an undefined function 'inspect'. Verify function names and their availability before use.\n\n### Errors when Placing Offshore Pump without Inventory\n- Ensure you have the offshore pump in your inventory before attempting to place it. An attempt to place an offshore pump failed due to it not being in the inventory."}
