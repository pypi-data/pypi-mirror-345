{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (46.0, -82.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace at position (46.0, -82.0) that processes iron ore into iron plates and copper ore into copper plates/cables.\n- Wooden chest at position (47.5, -81.5) that collects the output from the furnace.\n- Burner inserter at position (48.5, -81.5) placed adjacent to the furnace and rotated to face a drop position at (49.5, -81.5) for transferring items.\n\nRecent Updates:\n- Steps 72\u201373: The furnace received 10 iron ore at (46.0, -82.0) and processed a portion into 2 iron plates, remaining with 6 iron ore as input. An entity update shows the furnace in a working state, the wooden chest empty, and the burner inserter with a warning indicating it is waiting for source items.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement and Tile Occupation\n- Verify that target tiles are unoccupied before placing any entity adjacent to critical structures to avoid spatial conflicts.\n\n### Inventory and API Argument Management\n- Ensure sufficient inventory before placement actions.\n- Use accurate entity references to prevent argument type errors during insertion operations.\n\n### Fuel and Entity State Management\n- Monitor and replenish fuel to prevent operational warnings. Regular observations of the burner inserter\u2019s fuel level, as well as the furnace\u2019s state, are key.\n- Confirm that entities are supplied with necessary source items before initiating transfers to avoid waiting states.\n\n### Timeout and Refresh Delays\n- Maintain timely updates on inventory and entity statuses to prevent delays. Refresh entity data as needed to obtain the most current state.\n\n"}
