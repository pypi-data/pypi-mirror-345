{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-18.5, 19.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam engine (position -18.5, 19.5)\n- Boiler (position -13.5, 20.0)\n- Offshore pump (position -11.5, 26.5)\n- PipeGroup (position -18.5, 16.5) connecting the steam engine to the boiler and offshore pump\n\n### Copper plate factory at position(-21.5, 25.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Assembling machine (position -21.5, 25.5)\n- Furnace (position -18.0, -49.0) with copper-ore input\n- PipeGroup (position -12.5, 21.5) connecting the factory to the water supply\n\n### Lab at position(-17.5, 23.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab (position -17.5, 23.5)\n\n### Furnace at position(5.0, -73.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace (position 5.0, -73.0)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to inserting items\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities. For example, you received an error when trying to insert coal into the boiler without having coal in your inventory.\n\n### Errors when setting recipes for furnaces\n- Make sure that the furnace is correctly placed and operational before setting its recipe. The error indicates that no building was found that could have its recipe set, which suggests the furnace may not be properly initialized or connected.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity on a tile before attempting to place it."}
