{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Collection and Transfer System at position (x=42.0, y=-83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=42.0, y=-83.0) with status NO_FUEL, output blocked by item on the ground.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=42.5, y=-81.5) with status WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS, fueled with coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=43.5, y=-80.5) to collect coal.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at position (x=-15.0, y=-49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-15.0, y=-49.0) with status FULL_OUTPUT, fueled with coal, processing iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure you can place an entity at a tile before attempting placement. Avoid placing entities where there is an existing object in the way.\n\n### Errors related to entity dimensions and positioning\n- Verify the dimensions and positions of entities before placing them to ensure they align correctly with other entities they interact with.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors in type casting and API usage\n- Ensure that variables are correctly typed and casted when using APIs. For instance, when using integer conversion functions, ensure the input is a valid string or number."}
