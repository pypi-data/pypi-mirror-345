{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line (x=1-3, y=1-3.5)\nConsists of:\n- Two stone furnaces at positions (1.0, 1.0) and (3.0, 1.0)\n- Two burner inserters at positions (1.5, 2.5) and (3.5, 2.5)\n- Two wooden chests storing iron plates at positions (1.5, 3.5) and (3.5, 3.5)\n\n### Copper Plate Production Line (x=2-4, y=7-9.5)\nConsists of:\n- Two stone furnaces at positions (2.0, 7.0) and (4.0, 7.0)\n- Two burner inserters at positions (2.5, 8.5) and (4.5, 8.5)\n- Two wooden chests storing copper plates at positions (2.5, 9.5) and (4.5, 9.5)\n\n### Research Facility (x=6.5-12.5, y=16.5-17.5)\nConsists of:\n- Two labs at positions (6.5, 16.5) and (12.5, 17.5)\n- Connected to power network\n- Currently researching logistics technology\n\n### Power Generation System (x=-5.5-13.5, y=26.5-35.5)\nConsists of:\n- Working offshore pump at position (2.5, 35.5)\n- Boiler at position (7.0, 35.5)\n- Steam engine at position (13.5, 35.5)\n- Two pipe groups:\n  - Water pipes connecting pump to boiler\n  - Steam pipes connecting boiler to engine\n- Extensive electricity pole network connecting power to facilities\n- Non-functional offshore pump at position (-5.5, 26.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Fluid Connection Issues\n- Ensure offshore pumps are properly connected to water tiles and have valid connection points\n- The offshore pump at (-5.5, 26.5) has no fluid connections - verify placement near water\n\n### Production Line Status\n- Furnaces are showing \"no ingredients to smelt\" warnings - ensure proper input material supply\n- Some inserters show \"chest is full\" warnings - consider adding more storage or improving item transport\n\n### Power Network Planning\n- When expanding the power network, ensure all machines requiring electricity are within connection range of power poles\n- Plan power pole placement to maintain continuous coverage between power sources and consumers"}
