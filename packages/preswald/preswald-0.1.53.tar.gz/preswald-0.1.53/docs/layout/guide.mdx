# Using the `size` Parameter in Components

The `size` parameter lets you control how much space a component occupies in a row, enabling you to create dynamic and responsive layouts.

---

## How the `size` Parameter Works

- **Default Behavior**: All components have a default `size=1.0`, taking up the full width of the row.
- **Custom Sizes**: You can specify a `size` less than `1.0` to allow multiple components to share the same row.
- **Row Limit**: The combined `size` of components in a row cannot exceed `1.0`.
- **Dependency**: A component only shares a row if another component is placed after it.

## Example: Multiple Components in One Row

Hereâ€™s an example of how to use the `size` parameter to arrange components in a row:

```python
from preswald import slider, button

# Two sliders sharing a row
slider1 = slider("Filter 1", min_val=0.0, max_val=10.0, default=5.0, size=0.5)
slider2 = slider("Filter 2", min_val=0.0, max_val=10.0, default=5.0, size=0.5)

# Button and slider sharing a row
submit_button = button("Submit", size=0.3)
threshold_slider = slider("Threshold", min_val=0.0, max_val=100.0, default=50.0, size=0.7)
```

- **Flexible Layouts**: Multiple components with smaller sizes can fit side by side in a single row.
- **Spacing Management**: Verify the combined sizes of all components in a row add up to `1.0` or less.
