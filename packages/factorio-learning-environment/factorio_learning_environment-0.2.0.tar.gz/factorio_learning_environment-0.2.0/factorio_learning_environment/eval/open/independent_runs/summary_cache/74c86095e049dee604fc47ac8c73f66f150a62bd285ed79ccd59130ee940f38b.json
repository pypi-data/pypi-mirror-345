Clear any existing objects that might be in the way.\n\n### Errors when Connecting Electric Poles\n- Verify that electric poles are properly aligned and within connection range. Ensure there are no gaps in the power network and that poles are correctly indexed.\n\n### Steam Engine Not Generating Power\n- Confirm that the steam engine is properly connected to both the water source and the power network. Ensure that all necessary fluids are present and flowing through the system.\n\n### Inserter Not Receiving Power\n- Check that the inserter is connected to an active power network. Ensure that electric poles are functioning and providing power to connected devices."}
