{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Setup at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) with coal as fuel, actively mining iron ore and transferring it to a chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5) storing iron ore mined by the drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5), intended to transfer iron ore from the chest to the furnace but currently misaligned.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0), intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates but not receiving iron ore due to misalignment of the inserter.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Alignment\n- Ensure that the inserter's pickup position aligns with the chest's position and the drop position aligns with the furnace's position. Misalignment prevents the transfer of iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Fueling\n- Regularly check the fuel levels of inserters to avoid them running out of fuel, which can halt the transfer process. Ensure inserters are refueled with coal or other suitable fuel.\n\n### Errors with Resource Availability\n- Ensure there is enough coal in the inventory to refuel entities like the burner inserter and mining drill. Running out of coal can cause operational interruptions.\n\n### Errors with Inventory Management\n- Before attempting to insert items into entities, verify that the required items are available in your inventory to avoid insertion errors."}
