{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System\n- **Offshore pump** at position (-9.5, 19.5) - Working, connected to water system\n- **Boiler** at position (18.0, 22.5) - Fueled with coal (47 units), steam output at 165\u00b0C but no input liquid\n- **Steam engine** at position (22.5, 22.5) - Not connected to power network despite nearby poles\n- **Pipes** (31 water pipes) forming partial fluid system\n\n### Oil Processing Complex\n- **Pumpjack** at position (17.5, 40.5) - Not receiving power despite nearby poles\n- **Oil refinery** at position (27.5, 40.5) - Recipe set to basic oil processing but no power\n- **Storage tank** at position (32.5, 22.5) - Empty, not receiving petroleum gas\n- **Pipes** (27 crude oil pipes) partially connecting pumpjack to refinery\n\n### Chemical Production Setup\n- **Chemical plant** at position (37.5, 22.5) - Recipe set to sulfur but no power/inputs\n- **Power poles** network with 434 poles, voltage at 3.57MW but critical components unpowered\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Fluid Connection Failures (Recurring)\n- Verify connection points are unobstructed before connecting (pumpjack-refinery connection failures)\n- Ensure fluid presence in source before connection attempts (empty storage tank connection)\n- Check power status of fluid-producing entities (pumpjack power verification)\n- Validate pipe routing matches entity connection points (chemical plant input mismatch)\n\n### Power System Issues\n- Confirm critical production chain components are powered (refinery/pumpjack power verification)\n- Verify power pole placement covers all production buildings\n- Check steam engine power network connection status\n\n### System Validation\n- Monitor fluid levels in storage before connection attempts\n- Verify all production chain components are operational before asserting throughput\n- Implement proper error handling for connection attempts\n- Check entity power requirements before placement\n\n### Connection Best Practices\n- Clear blocked connection points before retrying\n- Verify fluid types match between connected systems\n- Check entity directions align with connection points\n- Validate pipe routing distance limitations\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Functions\n- `connect_fluid_system(source: Entity, target: Entity, pipe_count: int) -> bool` - Needs additional power/fluid validation\n- `verify_power_connection(entity: Entity) -> bool` - Requires implementation to check power network coverage\n\n### Variables\n- `steam_engine_pos: Position` - Position of unconnected steam engine\n- `refinery_pos: Position` - Location of unpowered oil refinery\n- `chemical_plant_pos: Position` - Location of chemical plant with multiple issues\n- `output_chest_pos: Position` - Still undefined target position (40.5, 22.5)"}
