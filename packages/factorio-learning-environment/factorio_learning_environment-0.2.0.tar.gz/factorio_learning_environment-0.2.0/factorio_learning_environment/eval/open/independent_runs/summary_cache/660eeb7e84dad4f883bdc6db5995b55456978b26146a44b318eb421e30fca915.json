Currently contains 37 iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when extracting/inserting items into a chest\n- The agent is encountering a \"cannot access local variable 'x' where it is not associated with a value\" error when trying to extract items from its inventory and insert them into a chest. This suggests a problem with how the item transfer logic is implemented, specifically in accessing or referencing the item quantities or types to be transferred. Review the code that handles item extraction and insertion, paying close attention to variable scope and initialization.\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- The agent is failing to place a new chest near a full chest due to \"Placement conditions not met.\" This could be due to obstructions, incorrect tile targeting, or placement rules specific to chests (e.g., minimum distance from other structures). Before attempting placement, ensure the target tile is free of obstructions and satisfies all placement conditions.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Variables\n- Inventory contents: `dict[str, int]` = {'transport-belt': 6, 'coal': 600, 'iron-ore': 1800, 'copper-ore': 1289, 'iron-plate': 453}\n- Chest contents: `dict[str, int]` = {'iron-plate': 37}\n```"}
