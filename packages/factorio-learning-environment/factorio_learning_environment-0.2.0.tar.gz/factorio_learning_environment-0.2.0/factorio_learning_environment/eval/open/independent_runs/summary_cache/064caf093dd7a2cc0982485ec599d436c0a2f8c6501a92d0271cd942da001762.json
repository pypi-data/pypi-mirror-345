{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Facility at position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0) with a drop position at (x=-16.5, y=-52.5), currently fueled with coal and actively mining iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0), fueled with coal, used for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure there is enough space and the correct orientation when placing entities like Burner Inserters and Wooden Chests. Attempting to place these entities next to other structures often fails due to space constraints or incorrect positioning.\n\n### Errors when extracting or inserting items\n- Make sure the target entity for extraction or insertion is valid and contains the required resources. For instance, attempting to extract iron ore from an invalid position or inserting into a furnace without proper alignment can cause errors.\n\n### Errors when connecting entities\n- Use inserters to transfer items between entities such as chests and belts. Directly connecting belts to chests without an inserter will result in errors.\n\n### Warnings about blocked outputs\n- Ensure there is a sink entity (like a chest or belt) in place to accept outputs from mining drills. If the output is blocked, clear the area or place a suitable entity to receive the items.\n\n### Warnings about missing ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. If a furnace is not producing, check that it has both fuel and the required raw materials."}
