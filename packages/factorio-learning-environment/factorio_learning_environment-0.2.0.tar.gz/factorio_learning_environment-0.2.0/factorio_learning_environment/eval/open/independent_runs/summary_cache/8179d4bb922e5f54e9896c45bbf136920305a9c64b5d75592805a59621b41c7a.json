{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report (Updated)\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Operation at (15.5, 70.5)\n- Electric mining drill at (15.5, 70.5) facing DOWN\n- Output chest at (15.5, 72.5)\n- Connected to small electric pole at (17.5, 69.5)\n- Currently not powered (status: NO_POWER)\n\n### Copper Ore Mining Operation at (-46.5, 70.5)\n- Electric mining drill at (-46.5, 70.5) facing DOWN\n- Output chest at (-46.5, 72.5) containing 10 copper ore\n- Connected to small electric pole at (-44.5, 69.5)\n- Currently working (status: WORKING)\n\n### Water Supply System (Original)\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, -0.5) facing RIGHT\n- Extensive pipe network extending from (-8.5, -0.5) to (30.5, 63.5)\n- Currently working (status: WORKING) with water flowing\n\n### New Power Plant at (-9.5, 9.5)\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, 9.5) facing RIGHT\n- Boiler at (-6.0, 10.5) facing RIGHT (fuel: 45 coal)\n- Steam engine at (-1.5, 10.5) facing RIGHT\n- Connected pipe network:\n  - Water pipes from (-8.5, 9.5) to boiler\n  - Steam pipe at (-4.5, 10.5)\n- Currently working (status: WORKING)\n\n### Extended Water Pipe Network\n- Original water pipe system still operational\n- New water pipe segment added at (30.5, 63.5) containing 5998.52 units of water\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Distance Errors (Repeated)\n- Attempted to place offshore pump at (-11.0, 80.0) while at (20.5, 80.5)\n- Attempted to place boiler at (30.5, 65.5) while at (0, 0)\n- Attempted to place boiler at (31.0, 65.5) while at (0, 0)\n  - Always move within 10 tiles before placing entities\n  - Verify player position relative to target position\n\n### Fluid System Connection Issues\n- Failed to connect boiler at (31.0, 65.5) to itself (invalid self-connection)\n- Boiler at (-6.0, 10.5) shows NOT_CONNECTED status despite pipe connections\n  - Verify connection points are properly aligned\n  - Ensure fluid systems are properly initialized before connection attempts\n  - Check for blocked connection points\n\n### Entity Access Errors\n- Attempted to access non-existent electric mining drill at (15.5, 70.5)\n  - Verify entity exists before accessing\n  - Use proper entity detection methods before operations\n\n### General Tips (Updated)\n- When placing boilers, ensure proper clearance (3x2 tiles)\n- Verify all power plant components are properly connected:\n  - Offshore pump \u2192 pipes \u2192 boiler \u2192 steam engine\n- For long-distance operations, move closer before placement attempts\n- After placing entities, verify their connection status\n- Clear areas completely before rebuilding systems"}
