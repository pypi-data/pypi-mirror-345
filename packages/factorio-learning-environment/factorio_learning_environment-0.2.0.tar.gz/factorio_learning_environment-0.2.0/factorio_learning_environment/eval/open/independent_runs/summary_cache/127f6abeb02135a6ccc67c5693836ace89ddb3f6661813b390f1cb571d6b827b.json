{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0) used for smelting iron ore into iron plates. The furnace is currently working with coal as fuel and smelting iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter 1** at position (1.5, 0.5) transferring iron plates from the furnace to a wooden chest. It is fueled by coal and is currently working.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (2.5, 0.5) collecting iron plates from the burner inserter. The chest currently holds 23 iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter 2** at position (4.5, 0.5) intended to transfer items but is currently waiting for source items.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities without required items\n- Ensure you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to place entities like burner inserters or transport belts.\n\n### Errors when crafting without required sub-ingredients\n- Verify that you have all the necessary sub-ingredients in your inventory or accessible production facilities before attempting to craft complex items like transport belts.\n\n### Errors when connecting belts directly from chests\n- Use an inserter to transfer items from a chest to a belt, as belts cannot be directly connected to a chest.\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Check that the target tile is unoccupied before placing a new entity to avoid placement errors.\n\n### Errors when inserting items without sufficient inventory\n- Confirm that you have enough items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity, such as inserting coal into a burner inserter."}
