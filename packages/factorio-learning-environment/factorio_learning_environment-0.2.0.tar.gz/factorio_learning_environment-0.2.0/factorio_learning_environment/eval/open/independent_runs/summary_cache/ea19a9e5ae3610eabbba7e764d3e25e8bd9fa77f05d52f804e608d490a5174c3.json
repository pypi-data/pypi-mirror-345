The maximum distance allowed is 10 units.\n* Errors when attempting to insert items into a furnace when the required items are not available in the inventory\n  - Ensure that the required items are available in the inventory before attempting to insert them into the furnace.\n* Errors when attempting to craft items without the required sub-ingredients\n  - Ensure that all required sub-ingredients are available before attempting to craft an item. The required iron-plate amount for assembling-machine-1 is 9, and the required copper-plate amount for copper-cable is 5.\n* Errors when furnace is out of fuel or ingredients\n  - Ensure that the furnace has sufficient fuel and ingredients to operate. \n* Errors when chest is full\n  - Ensure that the chest is emptied before continuing to mine or produce items. \n* Errors when attempting to extract items that are not present in a chest or furnace\n  - Ensure that the required items are present in the chest or furnace before attempting to extract them.\n* Errors when entities are out of fuel\n  - Ensure that entities that require fuel have sufficient fuel to operate. \n* Errors when output is blocked\n  - Ensure that there is a sink entity in place to accept the output. \n* Errors due to undefined variables\n  - Ensure that all variables are defined before using them in the code. Check for typos and undefined names.\n* Errors when attempting to connect transport belts directly to entities that are not transport belts\n  - Ensure that transport belts are connected to other transport belts or to inserters that input or output items from the belt.\n* Errors when attempting to place entities at positions that are already occupied\n  - Ensure that the target position is clear of other entities before attempting to place a new entity.\n* Errors when attempting to get an entity that does not exist at a specified position\n  - Ensure that the entity exists at the specified position before attempting to get it.\n* Errors when attempting to use undefined names or variables in the code\n  - Check for typos and undefined names.\n* Errors when attempting to place an entity at a position that is too far away\n  - Move closer to the target position before attempting to place an entity.\n* Errors when attempting to place an entity at a"}
