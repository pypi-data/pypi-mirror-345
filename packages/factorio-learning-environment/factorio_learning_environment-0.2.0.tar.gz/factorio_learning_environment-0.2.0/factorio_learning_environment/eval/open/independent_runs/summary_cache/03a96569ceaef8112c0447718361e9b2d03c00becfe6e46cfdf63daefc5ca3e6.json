{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n  - Supplies iron ore to the production line.\n- **Furnace 1** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0)\n  - Converts iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Furnace 2** at position (x=-10.0, y=-48.0)\n  - Additional furnace for iron plate production.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (x=-14.5, y=-48.5), (x=-15.5, y=-48.5), (x=-6.5, y=-48.5), (x=-14.5, y=-46.5), (x=-7.5, y=-47.5), (x=-6.5, y=-47.5)\n  - Used for storing iron ore and iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserters** at positions (x=-13.5, y=-48.5), (x=-14.5, y=-47.5), (x=-8.5, y=-47.5), (x=-11.5, y=-45.5)\n  - Transfer items between chests, furnaces, and other entities.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inspecting Inventory\n- Ensure that the first argument passed to `inspect_inventory` is an Entity or Position object, not an integer. This will prevent `ValueError` when trying to inspect inventories.\n\n### Errors with Entity Retrieval\n- When using `get_entity`, confirm that the entity type and position are correct and that the entity exists at the specified location. This will prevent exceptions related to missing entities.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that source items are available for inserters to pick up. This can be achieved by maintaining a steady supply of resources to the source entities.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Space in Destination\n- Make sure that the destination for inserters is not full, allowing them to transfer items without being blocked. Regularly clear output from furnaces or chests to avoid this issue."}
