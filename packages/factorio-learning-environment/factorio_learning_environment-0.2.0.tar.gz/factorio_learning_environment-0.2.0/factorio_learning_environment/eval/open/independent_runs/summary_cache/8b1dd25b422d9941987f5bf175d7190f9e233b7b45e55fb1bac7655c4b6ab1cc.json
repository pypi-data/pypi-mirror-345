{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=5.5, y=21.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=5.5, y=21.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=-1.5, y=24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and the boiler to the steam engine\n- Small Electric Pole at position (x=3.5, y=20.5) connecting the steam engine to the lab\n\n### Lab at Position (x=2.5, y=0.5)\n- Lab conducting Automation research\n- Connected to the electricity network via small electric poles\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) for smelting copper ore into copper plates\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Insufficient Materials for Crafting\n- Ensure you have enough materials in your inventory before attempting to craft items. For example, copper plates and copper cables are needed for crafting small electric poles.\n\n### Incorrect Entity Connections\n- Verify that you have the necessary items in your inventory to connect entities. For instance, connecting pipes or electric poles requires having those items available.\n\n### Entity Not Found Errors\n- Double-check the positions and existence of entities before attempting operations like extraction or insertion. Ensure the entity exists at the specified position.\n\n### Name Errors in Code\n- Ensure all variable names are correctly defined and match the intended usage. For example, ensure 'Lab' is properly defined in the context it is used.\n\n### Assertion Errors\n- Verify that all systems are functioning as expected. For instance, ensure the steam engine is working by checking its status and fuel levels.\n\n### Insufficient Fuel\n- Regularly check fuel levels in boilers and other fuel-dependent entities to prevent interruptions in operations."}
