{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (52.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (52.0, -82.0) extracting coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (53.5, -80.5) receiving coal from the drill.\n- Burner Inserter at position (52.5, -79.5) transferring coal from the chest at (53.5, -80.5) to another chest at (52.5, -78.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -78.5) storing coal.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-12.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-12.0, -51.0) extracting iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) processing iron ore into iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-11.5, -49.5) storing iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-11.5, -48.5) transferring iron ore from the chest at (-11.5, -49.5).\n- Burner Inserter at position (-8.5, -48.5) waiting for source items.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -46.5) waiting for source items.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Multiple inserters (positions: 52.5, -79.5; 52.5, -76.5; -11.5, -48.5; -8.5, -48.5; -13.5, -46.5) are waiting for source items. Ensure that the source entities have items available for the inserters to pick up. Check for blockages or missing items in the production line.\n\n### Chest Full Warning\n- The chest at position (-11.5, -49.5) is full, preventing further mining by the drill at (-12.0, -51.0). Regularly empty chests that are part of active production lines to avoid halting production.\n\n### Furnace No Ingredients Warning\n- The stone furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) has no ingredients to smelt. Ensure a continuous supply of raw materials to maintain production efficiency.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Defined Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined by the agent in the provided logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `inventory`: Dictionary holding current inventory items and their counts. Example: `{'wooden-chest': 3, 'wood': 10, 'coal': 635, 'iron-ore': 1014, 'iron-plate': 1165}`.\n\nNo utility functions have been invoked, and no additional variables have been assigned beyond those mentioned in the logs."}
