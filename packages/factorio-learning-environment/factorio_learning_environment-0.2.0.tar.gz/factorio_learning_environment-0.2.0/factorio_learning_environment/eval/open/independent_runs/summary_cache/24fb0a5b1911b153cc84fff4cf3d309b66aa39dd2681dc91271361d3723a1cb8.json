{"content": "I'll create a report based on the provided logs:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining Setup at (40.0, -85.0)\n- Burner mining drill positioned at (40.0, -85.0)\n- Wooden chest at (40.5, -83.5) for collecting coal\nCurrent status: Drill needs fuel, chest contains 18 coal\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Setup at (3.0, -60.0)\n- Burner mining drill at (3.0, -60.0) mining iron ore, facing right\n- Burner inserter at (4.5, -60.5) to transfer ore\n- Stone furnace at (6.0, -60.0) for smelting iron plates\nCurrent status: System stalled - drill waiting for space in destination, inserter waiting for items, furnace has no ingredients but contains 6 iron plates in result inventory\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement and Configuration Issues\n- Ensure proper spacing between entities - multiple attempts were made to position the iron mining setup correctly\n- When placing inserters, verify both pickup and drop positions align with source and destination entities\n- Check entity rotation before finalizing placement - inserters needed multiple adjustments to face the correct direction\n\n### Resource Management\n- Maintain adequate fuel (coal) supply for all burner entities\n- Ensure to add fuel to both mining drills and inserters when placing them\n- Keep track of coal reserves - one mining drill stopped due to lack of fuel\n\n### Space Management\n- Clear any items on ground that might block entity output\n- Ensure proper item flow by having receiving entities (like furnaces) in correct positions relative to inserters\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nFunctions:\n- insert_item(prototype: Prototype, entity: Entity, quantity: int) -> Entity\n  Success: When inventory has items to insert\n  Failure: When trying to insert items not in inventory\n\nVariables:\n- drill_status: EntityStatus\n- inserter_status: EntityStatus\n- furnace_status: EntityStatus\n- coal_inventory: Dict[str, int]"}
