{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone furnace at position(-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone furnace (position -15.0, -50.0) which is currently processing iron ore into iron plates. The furnace has a warning indicating that the result inventory is full.\n\n### Burner mining drill at position(41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 41.0, -82.0) which is currently mining resources. It has been refueled and is working, but there is a warning that the chest at the drop position (41.5, -80.5) is full and needs to be emptied to continue mining.\n- Wooden chest (position 41.5, -80.5) which is currently holding coal.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(x)\nConsists of following entities\n-  Burner mining drill (position x1) and a furnace at position(y1)\n-  Burner mining drill (position x2) and a furnace at position(y2)\n-  Burner mining drill (position x3) and a furnace at position(y3)\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n- Errors when inserting items into the stone furnace:\n  - Ensure that the furnace's result inventory is not full before inserting items. If it is full, you need to either remove the items or expand the storage capacity.\n  \n- Errors when using the burner mining drill:\n  - The wooden chest at the drop position is full. Empty the chest at (41.5, -80.5) to allow the burner mining drill to continue mining resources.\n\n- Errors when harvesting resources:\n  - Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before attempting to harvest items.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the current execution logs.\n- Important variables assigned:\n  - `wooden-chest`: type `int`\n  - `wood`: type `int`\n  - `coal`: type `int`\n  - `iron-plate`: type `int`\n  - `iron-ore`: type `int`"}
