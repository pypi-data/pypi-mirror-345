{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-13.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) extracting iron ore, refueled with coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) storing extracted iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-14.5, -46.5) transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n\n### Coal Mining and Smelting Facility at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) extracting coal, refueled with coal.\n- Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -80.5) storing extracted coal.\n- Stone Furnace at position (43.0, -82.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (43.5, -80.5) transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors When Inserting Items Without Inventory\n- Ensure that the inventory contains the required items before attempting to insert them into another entity. This will prevent errors related to \"No iron-ore to insert from your inventory.\"\n\n### Errors Due to Full Chests\n- Regularly check and empty chests at drop positions to prevent mining drills from stopping due to full storage. This will ensure continuous operation of mining drills.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Ingredients in Furnace\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt by regularly supplying them with raw materials. This will prevent furnaces from stopping with a \"no ingredients to smelt\" warning."}
