{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 20.0)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine (position not specified)\n- Boiler at position (-5.5, 20.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Multiple PipeGroups connecting the offshore pump to the boiler, with various positions and statuses indicating they are empty.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (4.0, -60.0)\nConsists of:\n- Furnace at position (4.0, -60.0) with coal as fuel and iron plates as a result.\n- Furnace at position (5.0, -60.0) with coal as fuel and iron plates as a result.\n\n### Coal Mining Facility\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (42.0, -84.0) dropping into a Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -85.5) containing coal.\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) dropping into a Wooden Chest at position (40.5, -83.5) containing coal.\n\n### Electrical Infrastructure\n- Multiple Electricity Groups with poles at various positions, all with zero voltage, indicating they are not currently powered.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Reconnecting Offshore Pump to Boiler\n- Ensure you have enough pipes in your inventory to connect the offshore pump to the boiler.\n- Verify that you have enough iron plates to craft additional pipes if necessary.\n\n### Errors with Fueling Mining Drills\n- Check that all burner mining drills have sufficient fuel to operate. Refill them with coal or another suitable fuel source to avoid operational downtime.\n\n### Errors with Power Supply\n- Ensure that all electrical entities are connected to a power source and that the power source is operational to provide the necessary electricity.\n\n### Errors with Furnaces Not Receiving Ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Check the supply lines and ensure that raw materials are being delivered to the furnaces.\n\n### Errors with Electric Mining Drill Not Receiving Power\n- Connect the electric mining drill to a power network that is operational. Ensure that the power network is connected to a functional power source."}
