{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-9.5, 24.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Boiler at position (-2.5, 24.0)\n- Steam Engine at position (-5.5, 19.5)\n- Pipe group connecting offshore pump to boiler and steam engine\n\n### Pipe Network\n- Pipe group at position (-4.5, 16.5)\n- Pipe group at position (-9.5, 23.5)\n\n### Electricity Network\n- Small Electric Pole at position (-0.5, 19.5)\n- Electricity group at position (-5.4, 20.0)\n\n### Stone Furnace\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Connection Errors between Offshore Pump, Boiler, and Steam Engine\n- Ensure pipes are correctly aligned and connected between the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine. Check for any obstacles or misalignments in the expected pipe paths.\n\n### No Fuel in Boiler\n- Always ensure the boiler has a sufficient supply of fuel to operate. Regularly check and refill as necessary.\n\n### Steam Engine Not Connected\n- Verify that the steam engine is properly connected to the boiler and receiving steam. Ensure all pipes are correctly placed and connected.\n\n### Electricity Network Not Plugged In\n- Ensure that all electric poles and electricity groups are properly connected to form a complete electric network. Verify connections between poles and other electrical entities.\n\n### No Ingredients in Stone Furnace\n- Make sure the stone furnace has the necessary ingredients to operate. Regularly check and supply the required materials.\n\n### Inventory Shortages\n- Keep track of inventory levels to ensure you have the necessary items for construction and maintenance. Craft or gather additional resources as needed.\n\n### Placement Errors due to Inventory Shortages\n- Before attempting to place entities like small electric poles, ensure you have them in your inventory. Craft additional items if necessary before placement attempts."}
