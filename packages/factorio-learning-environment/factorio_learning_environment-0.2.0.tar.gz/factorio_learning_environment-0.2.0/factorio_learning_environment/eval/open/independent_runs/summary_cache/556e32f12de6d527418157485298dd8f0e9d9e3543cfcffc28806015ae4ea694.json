{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at position (-7.5, 22.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (-5.5, 19.5)\n- Boiler at position (-2.5, 24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe Group connecting the Offshore Pump and Boiler\n- Small Electric Poles at positions (-7.5, 22.5), (-6.5, 22.5), and (-1.5, 20.5) to connect the Steam Engine to the power network\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when attempting to connect entities without required items\n- Ensure you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to connect entities. For example, ensure you have pipes before connecting a boiler to a steam engine.\n\n### Errors when placing entities without required items\n- Verify that you have the required items in your inventory before placing them. For example, ensure you have small electric poles before attempting to place them.\n\n### Errors when inserting items without sufficient inventory\n- Check your inventory to ensure you have enough items before attempting to insert them into entities. For example, ensure you have coal before inserting it into a boiler.\n\n### Errors when connecting pipes\n- Ensure that the entities you are trying to connect with pipes are correctly aligned and that you have enough pipes in your inventory.\n\n### Errors with power network connections\n- Make sure all parts of the power network are connected properly and that there are no gaps in the electric pole connections to ensure entities are powered.\n\n### Assertion errors for entity status\n- Regularly check the status of your entities to ensure they are working as expected. If an entity is not working, investigate and resolve the underlying issue, such as lack of fuel or missing connections."}
