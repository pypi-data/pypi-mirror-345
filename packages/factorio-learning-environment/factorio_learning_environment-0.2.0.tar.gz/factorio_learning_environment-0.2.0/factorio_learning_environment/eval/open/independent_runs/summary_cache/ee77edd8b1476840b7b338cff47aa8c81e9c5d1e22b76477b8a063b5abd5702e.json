The logs indicate that there were attempts to place various entities, but none have been successfully established due to placement errors.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied or invalid tiles\n- Ensure that the target tile is unoccupied and valid for the entity you are trying to place. This can be done by checking the tile's status before attempting to place an entity. Errors were encountered when attempting to place:\n  - Transport Belt at x=65.0 y=-105.0\n  - Stone Furnace at x=5.0 y=5.0\n  - Burner Inserter at x=-50.0 y=50.0 and x=-100.0 y=100.0\n  - Wooden Chest at x=0.0 y=10.0, x=10.0 y=0.0, and x=0.0 y=0.0\n\n### General Tips\n- Regularly check the map for available space before placing structures to avoid placement errors.\n- Consider the layout and connectivity of structures to ensure efficient resource flow and avoid overlapping entities."}
