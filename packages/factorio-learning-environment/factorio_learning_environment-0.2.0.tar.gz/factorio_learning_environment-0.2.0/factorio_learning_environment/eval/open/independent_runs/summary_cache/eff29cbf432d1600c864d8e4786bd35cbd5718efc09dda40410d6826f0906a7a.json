{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at Position (-1.5, 24.5)\n- Boiler at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe network connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0)\n- Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5) for storage of produced items\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) for moving items between entities\n\n### Electricity Network\n- Small Electric Poles at various positions, including (5.5, -60.5), (7.5, -60.5), and (5.5, -59.5), connecting various entities to the power network\n\n### Research Lab\n- Lab with input of automation science packs, currently not conducting research\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Retrieving Entities\n- Ensure that the entity type and position are correct when using `get_entity`. Double-check the position coordinates and entity type to avoid retrieval errors.\n\n### Timeout Errors in Entity Retrieval\n- When using `get_entities` with a radius, ensure that the area specified contains the entities you are trying to retrieve. Consider increasing the radius or adjusting the position to include the desired entities.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Not Receiving Power\n- Verify that inserters are properly connected to a power source. Check the connections between inserters and small electric poles to ensure they are within range and correctly aligned.\n\n### Errors with Steam Engine Not Connected to Power Network\n- Ensure that the steam engine is properly connected to the electricity network. Check for any missing connections or poles that may be preventing power distribution.\n\n### Errors with Boilers Out of Fuel\n- Regularly check fuel levels in boilers and ensure they are refueled to maintain continuous operation."}
