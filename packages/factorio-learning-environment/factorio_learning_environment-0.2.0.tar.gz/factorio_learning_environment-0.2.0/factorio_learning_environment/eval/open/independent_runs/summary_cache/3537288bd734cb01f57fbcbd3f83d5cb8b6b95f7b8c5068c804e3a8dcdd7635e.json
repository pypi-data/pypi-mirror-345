{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-16.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (x=-16.0, y=-51.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (4 units)\n  - Energy: 2666.67\n  - Status: Working\n  - Warnings: Output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Neighbours: Stone Furnace\n  - Drop Position: (x=-16.5, y=-52.5)\n  - Resources: Iron Ore (40,000 units)\n- Stone Furnace at Position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal (14 units)\n  - Energy: 1600.0\n  - Status: No Ingredients\n  - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt\n  - Furnace Source: Empty\n  - Furnace Result: Iron Plate (60 units)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied or incorrect positions\n- Ensure the target tile is unoccupied and suitable for the entity before attempting placement. This applies to Transport Belts, Burner Inserters, Wooden Chests, and other entities.\n\n### Errors related to entity retrieval\n- Verify the existence and correct position of entities before attempting to retrieve them. This will prevent errors such as \"Could not get Prototype.StoneFurnace at position x=-16.0 y=-53.0\".\n\n### Errors due to blocked outputs\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity or appropriate infrastructure to accept outputs from entities like mining drills to avoid warnings about blocked outputs.\n\n### Errors when refueling or interacting with entities\n- Move closer to the target entity before interacting, such as refueling, to ensure successful execution."}
