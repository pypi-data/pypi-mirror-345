Regularly check and balance inventories to prevent blockages.\n\n#### Inserter Waiting for Space in Destination\n- Clear blockages on transport belts or ensure that the destination inventory has space to receive items. Regularly manage inventory spaces to prevent stoppages.\n\n#### Chest Full Warnings\n- Regularly clear out chests that are full to allow continuous operation of mining drills and inserters. Consider expanding storage capacity if necessary."}
