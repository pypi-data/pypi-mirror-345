{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Manual Iron Smelting Setup at (5.0, -73.0)\nConsists of two furnaces working in parallel:\n- Stone furnace at (5.0, -73.0)\n- Stone furnace at (7.0, -73.0)\nBoth furnaces are operational and smelting iron ore into plates\n\n### Automated Iron Mining & Smelting Setup 1 at (-20.0, -55.0)\nComplete mining and smelting operation consisting of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-20.0, -55.0) mining iron ore\n- Stone furnace at (-19.0, -53.0) positioned at drill's drop position\nBoth entities are fueled with coal and operational\n\n### Automated Iron Mining & Smelting Setup 2 at (-15.0, -50.0)\nComplete mining and smelting operation consisting of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-15.0, -50.0) mining iron ore\n- Stone furnace at (-14.0, -48.0) positioned at drill's drop position\nBoth entities are fueled with coal and operational\n\n### Incomplete Mining Setup at (-7.0, -56.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-7.0, -56.0) (non-operational due to lack of fuel)\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to crafting requirements\n- When crafting items that require smelted materials (like iron plates), ensure they are smelted in a furnace first as they cannot be directly crafted\n\n### Errors related to item extraction\n- Verify that items are actually present in the target entity before attempting extraction\n- Check the entity status and inventory before attempting to extract items\n\n### Errors related to inventory management\n- Always verify required items are in inventory before attempting to use them\n- When placing mining drills, ensure you have coal in inventory for fueling them\n\n### Errors related to entity placement\n- When working with building coordinates, use proper attribute access methods instead of dictionary-style access\n- Place furnaces exactly at mining drill drop positions to ensure proper material flow\n- Ensure proper spacing between entities to avoid blocking and inefficient setups\n\n### Errors related to automation\n- Monitor entity status regularly to ensure proper operation\n- Place furnaces at exact drop positions of mining drills to prevent material flow issues\n- Keep track of fuel levels in burner entities to maintain continuous operation"}
