{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production (Position 0,0 and 2,0)\nTwo furnaces dedicated to producing iron plates:\n- Furnace 1 at (0,0) with coal fuel (25) and no ingredients\n- Furnace 2 at (2,0) with coal fuel (25) and no ingredients\nBoth furnaces are idle due to lack of ingredients\n\n### Copper Plate Production (Position 4,4 and 6,4)\nTwo furnaces dedicated to producing copper plates:\n- Furnace 3 at (4,4) with coal fuel (28) and no ingredients\n- Furnace 4 at (6,4) with coal fuel (29) and no ingredients\nBoth furnaces are idle due to lack of ingredients\n\n### Power Generation System (Position -7.5, 18.5)\nComplete power generation setup consisting of:\n- Steam engine at (-7.5, 18.5), working status, containing 200 steam at 165\u00b0\n- Boiler at (-7.5, 22.0), working with 2 coal, containing water (199.99) and steam (199.96)\n- Offshore pump at (-7.5, 25.5), working status, containing water (99.96)\n- Connected pipe groups:\n  - Steam pipes at (-7.5, 15.5)\n  - Empty pipes at (-7.5, 20.5)\n  - Water pipes at (-8.5, 23.5)\n- Electricity distribution network with multiple poles at positions (-9.5,18.5), (-5.5,18.5), (-1.5,18.5), (-0.5,5.5), (3.5,7.5), (7.5,7.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Lab Related Errors\n- Lab entity is missing from the map\n- Ensure lab is properly placed before attempting to access it\n- Verify lab recipe requirements before crafting (needs iron gear wheels, electronic circuits, and transport belts)\n- Cannot place lab without having it in inventory first\n\n### Research Prerequisites Errors\n- Check technology prerequisites before starting research\n- Steel Processing must be researched before Advanced Material Processing\n- Verify research requirements are met before attempting to start new research\n\n### Resource Management\n- Monitor coal levels in boiler to prevent running out of fuel\n- Keep track of ore supplies to maintain continuous plate production\n- Ensure furnaces have both fuel and ingredients to operate efficiently\n\n### Entity Placement and Access\n- Verify entity existence at specified coordinates before attempting to access\n- Double check coordinates when trying to access specific entities\n- Ensure required items are in inventory before attempting to place new entities\n\n### Production Management\n- Monitor furnace ingredient levels to prevent idle time\n- Keep track of fuel levels in all production buildings\n- Balance production between iron and copper based on needs\n\n### Inventory Management\n- Check inventory contents before attempting to use or place items\n- Maintain adequate supplies of basic materials for crafting\n- Keep track of science pack requirements for research"}
