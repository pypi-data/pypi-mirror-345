If necessary, gather more resources from the environment.\n\n# To proceed, I will:\n- Check the status of the furnaces again to see how much Iron Ore and Coal they are consuming.\n- Consider crafting more Small Electric Poles if the inventory allows.\n\n# Let's check the current status of the furnaces and then decide on crafting actions.\nprint(f\"Current Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")  # Log the current state of all entities to verify their operational status.", "summary_range": "[1-1498]"}
