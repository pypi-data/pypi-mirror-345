{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with a fuel inventory containing coal and producing iron plates.\n\n### Offshore Pump Station\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5), currently not connected to any fluid system, indicating it is not operational.\n\n### Research Lab\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab with automation science packs in input but currently lacks power, indicating it is not operational.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Attribute Errors with Boiler Dimensions\n- Ensure that the attributes you are trying to access, such as `tile_dimensions`, exist on the object. Verify the correct attribute names and their availability in the documentation or by inspecting the object.\n\n### Type Errors with ModelPrivateAttr\n- When performing arithmetic operations or type conversions, ensure that the operands are of compatible types. Avoid using internal attributes like `ModelPrivateAttr` directly in calculations. Instead, ensure you are using accessible and appropriate data types.\n\n### Unsupported Operand Type Errors\n- When adding or performing operations with different data types, ensure both operands are compatible. Convert or cast data types appropriately before performing operations.\n\n### No Ingredients to Smelt Warning\n- Ensure that the furnace has the necessary ingredients to process. Check the inventory and supply the required raw materials for smelting.\n\n### No Power in Lab\n- Ensure that the lab is connected to a power source. Check the electrical network and ensure the lab is properly connected and receiving power.\n\n### Offshore Pump Not Connected\n- Ensure that the offshore pump is connected to a fluid system. Check the connections and ensure they are correctly established to allow fluid flow."}
