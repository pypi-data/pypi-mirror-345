{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining Operation at (-15, -15)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at position (24.0, -15.0)\n- Wooden chest at position (23.5, -16.5) for coal storage\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Operation at (-14, 23)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at position (-14.0, 23.0)\n- Wooden chest at position (-14.5, 21.5) for iron ore storage\n\n### Iron Smelting Setup at (-10, 20)\nConsists of:\n- Two stone furnaces at positions (-11.0, 20.0) and (-9.0, 20.0)\n\n### Copper Processing Setup at (22, 20)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at position (20.0, 20.0)\n- Wooden chest at position (20.5, 21.5) for copper ore storage\n- Stone furnace at position (24.0, 20.0)\n- Burner inserter at position (22.5, 20.5) to feed furnace\n- Burner inserter at position (20.5, 22.5) to handle chest operations\n- Output chest at position (24.5, 17.5) for copper plates\n- Burner inserter at position (24.5, 18.5) to move processed plates\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with belt connections\n- Cannot connect belts directly from chests - must use inserters as intermediaries\n- When creating belt connections, ensure the path is clear and valid for belt placement\n- Belt connections should be planned with proper consideration of inserter positions and directions\n\n### Entity placement issues\n- Ensure proper spacing between entities to allow for belt and inserter connections\n- Consider the direction and orientation of inserters when planning material flow\n- Plan the layout considering the tile dimensions of different entities (mining drills are 2x2, furnaces are 2x2, chests and inserters are 1x1)\n\n### Resource management\n- Multiple mining drills are out of fuel - implement a fuel distribution system\n- Furnaces are idle due to lack of ingredients - ensure proper material flow from mining to smelting"}
