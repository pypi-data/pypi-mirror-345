Check for water or other entities in the way.\n\n### Errors when crafting sub-ingredients\n- When crafting an item, ensure all sub-ingredients can be crafted. In this case, copper plates could not be crafted, which are required for automation science packs. Ensure the copper plate production line is working.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Variables\n- None\n"}
