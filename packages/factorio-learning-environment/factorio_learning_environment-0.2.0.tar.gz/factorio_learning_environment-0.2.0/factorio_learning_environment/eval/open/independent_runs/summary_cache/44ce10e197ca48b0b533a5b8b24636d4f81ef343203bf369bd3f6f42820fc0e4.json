{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(52.5, 51.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position 52.5, 51.5), which is currently not connected to a power network, has no input liquid, and no fluid present in connections.\n\n### Offshore pump at position(-9.5, 24.5)\nConsists of offshore pump (position -9.5, 24.5) that is working and connected to a pipe network.\n\n### Copper plate factory at position(1, 1)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace (position 1.0, 1.0) which is currently out of ingredients to smelt.\n- Burner inserter (position 8.5, 1.5) which is out of fuel.\n- Lab (position 6.5, 1.5) that has no power and is currently researching automation.\n- Additional furnaces and chests located at various positions (3.5, 1.5), (10.0, 1.0), (3.5, 3.5), and (3.5, 5.5).\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting coal into steam engine\n- Ensure that the steam engine has available space for coal before attempting to insert items. Check if the engine is operational and accepting fuel.\n\n### Errors when connecting pipes\n- Verify the positions of the offshore pump and steam engine to ensure they are within the correct range for pipe connections. Ensure that the pipe connection is valid and that the entities are compatible.\n\n### NameError in script\n- Check for proper definitions of variables and ensure that all necessary libraries or modules are imported correctly to avoid undefined names in the script."}
