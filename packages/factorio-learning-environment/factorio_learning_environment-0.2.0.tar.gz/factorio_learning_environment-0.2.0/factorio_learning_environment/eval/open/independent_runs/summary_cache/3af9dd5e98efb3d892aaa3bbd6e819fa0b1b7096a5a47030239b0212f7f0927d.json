{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-4.5, 23.0)\nConsists of boiler (position -4.5, 23.0) and steam engine (position -0.5, -9.5).\n\n### Offshore pump at position(-7.5, 25.5)\nConsists of offshore pump (position -7.5, 25.5).\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 0, 0) and a furnace at position(1, 0).\n- Burner mining drill (position 2, 0) and a furnace at position(3, 0).\n- Burner mining drill (position 4, 0) and a furnace at position(5, 0).\n\n### Copper cable factory\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner mining drill (position 0, 0) and a furnace at position(1, 0).\n- Assembling machine at position(2, 0) and inserter at position(3, 0) that puts into assembling machine.\n- Beltgroup (position 4, 0) that connects the furnace at position 1, 0 to assembling machine at position(2, 0).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting boiler to steam engine\n- Ensure that the distance between connected entities does not exceed the maximum connection range. The current distance is 32.75 units, which is too far for a connection.\n\n### Errors when placing small electric poles\n- Ensure that the target location for placing a small electric pole is clear of other entities. The attempt to place a small electric pole at the steam engine's position failed due to an existing object in the way.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
