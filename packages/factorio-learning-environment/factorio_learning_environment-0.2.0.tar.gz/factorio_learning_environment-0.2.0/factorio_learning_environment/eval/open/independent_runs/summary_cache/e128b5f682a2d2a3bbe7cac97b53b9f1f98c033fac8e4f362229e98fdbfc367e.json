{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (41.0, -80.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) fueled by coal.\n- Stone Furnace at position (41.0, -80.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility at Position (-20.0, -71.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-21.0, -73.0) fueled by coal, extracting copper ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -71.0) for smelting copper ore into copper plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Insufficient Inventory Items\n- Ensure that you have enough items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into machines. For example, the error when trying to insert coal into the copper drill occurred because there was no coal available in the inventory.\n\n### Errors Due to Fuel Shortages\n- Regularly check and refuel mining drills and furnaces to prevent them from running out of fuel, which causes them to stop working.\n\n### Errors Due to Blocked Output\n- Ensure that the output of mining drills is not blocked by items on the ground. Make sure there is a sink entity, such as a furnace or chest, in place to accept the output.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `insert_item`: This function is used to insert items into machines. It failed when there was no coal in the inventory to insert into the copper drill.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `copper_drill`: Represents the copper mining drill entity.\n- `iron_drill`: Represents the iron mining drill entity.\n- `stone_furnace`: Represents the stone furnace entity for smelting ores."}
