{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-12.5, 24.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam engine at position (-12.5, 24.5)\n- Boiler at position (-5.5, 25.0)\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipes connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine\n- Electric pole at position (-13.5, 24.5) intended to connect the steam engine to the power network\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (15.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (15.0, 0.0) with coal as fuel and iron plates in the result inventory\n- Inserter at position (16.5, 0.5) and another at position (17.5, 0.5), both lacking power\n- Wooden chests at positions (5.5, 0.5) and (18.5, 0.5) for storage\n\n### Pipe Network\nConsists of multiple pipe groups connecting various entities:\n- Pipe group at position (-1.5, 17.5)\n- Pipe group at position (1.5, 17.5)\n- Pipe group at position (-12.5, 21.5)\n- Pipe group at position (-6.5, 20.5)\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Multiple electric poles, including one at position (17.5, -0.5), intended to supply electricity to inserters and other machinery\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Steam Engine and Boiler Not Connected\n- Ensure all components of the electricity generation system are correctly connected. The steam engine and boiler require proper fluid connections and must be linked to the power network.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Not Receiving Power\n- Verify that inserters are within the range of electric poles and that the electricity network is functional. Ensure that electric poles are correctly placed to supply power to all necessary entities.\n\n### Errors with Offshore Pump Not Connected\n- Ensure the offshore pump is correctly connected to the pipe network and that there are no missing pipes. This will allow the pump to supply water to the boiler.\n\n### Errors with Full Inventory in Boiler\n- Regularly check and manage the inventory of the boiler to prevent it from becoming full, which can halt operations.\n\n### Errors with Missing Pipes\n- Ensure all necessary pipes are placed to connect the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine. Missing pipes can disrupt the flow of fluids, preventing the system from functioning.\n\n### Errors with Entity Placement\n- Before placing entities, verify that the target tile is unoccupied and suitable for the entity type to avoid placement errors."}
