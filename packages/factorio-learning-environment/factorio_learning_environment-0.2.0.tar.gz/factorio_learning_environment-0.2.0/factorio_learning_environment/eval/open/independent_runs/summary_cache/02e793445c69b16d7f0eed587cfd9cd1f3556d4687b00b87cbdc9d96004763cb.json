{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) which is extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) which stores the extracted iron ore (currently contains 412 units).\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) which is intended to transfer iron ore from the wooden chest to a furnace. However, it is currently misaligned or not functioning properly, as indicated by the repeated repositioning and alignment attempts.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) which is supposed to smelt iron ore into iron plates. It is currently not receiving iron ore and has a warning of \"no ingredients to smelt\".\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure there is enough space and no collisions with existing entities when placing new entities. Consider adjusting spacing, direction, or reference position to avoid placement errors.\n\n### Inserter Alignment and Operation Issues\n- Verify the alignment and setup of inserters to ensure they are correctly positioned to transfer items between entities. Repeated repositioning suggests a persistent misalignment issue that needs addressing.\n- Ensure that inserters are fueled and have a clear path to operate effectively.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Ingredients\n- Check the inserter setup and ensure it is correctly configured to deliver iron ore to the furnace. The furnace's warning of \"no ingredients to smelt\" indicates a failure in the supply chain that needs rectification."}
