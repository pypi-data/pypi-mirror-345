{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Smelting Area at (0,0)\nConsists of two stone furnaces:\n- Stone furnace at Position(0,0) with coal fuel and iron plate output\n- Stone furnace at Position(2,0) with coal fuel and iron plate output\n\n### Copper Smelting Area at (4,4)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace at Position(4,4) with coal fuel and copper plate output\n\n### Power Generation System at (-9.5,24.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at Position(-9.5,24.5)\n- Boiler at Position(-7.0,24.5) connected via pipes\n- Steam engine at Position(-2.5,24.5) connected via pipes\n- Electric pole network at positions (4.5,8.5), (4.5,20.5), (0.5,24.5), (4.5,12.5), (4.5,16.5)\n\n### Research Lab\n- Lab structure (position not specified) connected to power network\n- Currently loaded with automation science packs but no power\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inventory Related Errors\n- Ensure required items are in inventory before attempting to insert into furnaces\n- Verify you have crafted/gathered required items before placing structures (e.g., stone furnace, offshore pump)\n- Raw resources like wood cannot be crafted and must be gathered from the environment\n\n### Recipe/Technology Related Errors\n- Research required technologies before attempting to craft items (e.g., assembling machine 1 requires automation technology)\n- Complex items require their sub-components to be crafted first (e.g., lab requires iron gear wheels and electronic circuits)\n\n### Furnace Operation Errors\n- Cannot mix different ore types in the same furnace (e.g., cannot insert copper ore into furnace containing iron ore)\n\n### Entity Connection Errors\n- Ensure you have required connection items (like pipes) in inventory before attempting to connect entities\n- When building power systems, ensure all components are properly connected and have required resources\n\n### Resource Management\n- Maintain adequate coal supplies for furnaces and boilers\n- Keep track of intermediate products needed for complex crafting recipes"}
