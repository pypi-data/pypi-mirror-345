Clear any obstructing entities or adjust the layout to allow for a clear connection path.\n\n### Errors with Steam Engine Not Generating Power\n- Verify that the steam engine is properly connected to the power network and receiving steam from the boiler. Check for any disconnections or missing pipes in the fluid system.\n\n### Boiler Not Producing Steam\n- Ensure that the boiler has sufficient fuel and water supply to produce steam. Check the fluid connections and fuel inventory to confirm proper operation.\n\n### Inserter Not Receiving Electricity\n- Check the connection of inserters to the power network. Ensure that they are within range of a powered electric pole and that the electricity network is functioning correctly."}
