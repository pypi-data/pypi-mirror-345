The keys of `kwargs` dicts are always strings, the type hint is for the values,
which in this case could be anything.

## 1.1.0.20240703 (2024-07-03)

Update assertpy/extracting.pyi so that kwargs are not required (#12229)

The recent change to better type the `sort` and `filter` kwargs had the
side effect of making them required. So we fix to supply a default
argument.
