{"content": "\"\"\"\nThe extraction of stone from the active furnace has been successful:\n\n### Active Furnace Output Status:\n- The active furnace now shows an empty inventory, indicating that all stone has been successfully removed.\n- The furnace status remains **\"WORKING\"**, but without any materials to process.\n\n### Overall Inventory Overview:\n- **Current Inventory**:\n  - 4 pieces of stone furnaces\n  - 7 pieces of coal remaining\n  - **1 piece of stone** available (after extraction).\n  - 5 pieces of iron ore\n  - **1 piece of copper ore** available.\n  - **21 pieces of iron plates** available.\n\n### Observations:\n- The furnace is now clear of any stone, which allows for new materials to be inserted.\n- The remaining inventory shows that there is still only **1 piece of stone**, which is insufficient for smelting operations.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Insert Copper Ore**: I will now attempt to insert the **1 piece of Copper Ore** into the furnace, as it is currently empty and should accept this input.\n2. **Monitor Furnace Engagement**: After inserting the Copper Ore, I will check if the furnace begins processing any materials.\n\nLet's proceed by inserting the Copper Ore into the active furnace. \n\"\"\"\n\n# Load the Copper Ore into the active furnace now that it is empty\ninsert_item(Prototype.CopperOre, active_furnace, quantity=1)  # Insert the available piece of Copper Ore into the active furnace\n\n# Check the inventory status of the furnace after loading Copper Ore\nactive_furnace_inventory_status_after_copper_insertion = inspect_inventory(active_furnace)  # Inspect the status of the furnace post-insertion\noverall_inventory_after_copper_loading = inspect_inventory()  # Check total inventory after inserting copper ore.\n\nprint(f\"Active Furnace inventory status after loading Copper Ore: {active_furnace_inventory_status_after_copper_insertion}\")  # Status of the furnace after loading copper ore.\nprint(f\"Overall current inventory after loading Copper Ore: {overall_inventory_after_copper_loading}\")  # Total inventory post operations.\nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")  # Review entities available on the map.", "summary_range": "[1-360]"}
