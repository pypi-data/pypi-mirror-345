{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-21.0, -62.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (-21.0, -62.0) with fuel 'coal' and a result of 'iron-plate'.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-17.5, -64.5) transferring items to a wooden chest at position (-16.5, -64.5).\n- BeltGroup connecting various entities, facilitating the movement of items.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Storage at Position (-23.0, -68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) extracting 'copper-ore'.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-23.5, -69.5) storing extracted copper ore.\n- Transport Belts connecting the mining drill to the storage chest.\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) extracting 'coal'.\n- Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5) storing extracted coal.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Transport at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) extracting 'iron-ore'.\n- Transport Belts and a Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5) facilitating the movement of iron ore.\n\n### Miscellaneous Structures\n- Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with warnings of 'no ingredients to smelt' and 'furnace fuel source is full'.\n- Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5) storing 'coal' and 'iron-plate'.\n- Burner Inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) waiting for source items.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Connecting Belts to Furnaces\n- Ensure that the target entities (furnaces) are properly initialized and have the necessary attributes before attempting to connect belts. Errors such as \"'NoneType' object has no attribute 'tile_dimensions'\" indicate that the target entity may not be correctly set up.\n\n### Inserter Output Blockage\n- Make sure there is a destination entity available to accept items from inserters. The warning 'output blocked by item on the ground' suggests that the inserter has no place to drop its output.\n\n### Furnace Ingredient Warnings\n- Verify that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. The warning 'no ingredients to smelt' indicates that the furnace is lacking input materials.\n\n### Inserter Source Item Availability\n- Ensure that inserters have access to source items. The status 'waiting for source items' indicates that the inserter is unable to find items to transfer."}
