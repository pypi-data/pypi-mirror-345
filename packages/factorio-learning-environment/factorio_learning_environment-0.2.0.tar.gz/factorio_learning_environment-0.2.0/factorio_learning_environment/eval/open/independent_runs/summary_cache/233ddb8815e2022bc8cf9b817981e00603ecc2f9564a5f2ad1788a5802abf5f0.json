{"content": "# Factorio Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position (52.5, 51.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam engine (position 52.5, 51.5) connected to a small electric pole (position 50.5, 50.5).\n\n### Offshore pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump (position -9.5, 24.5).\n\n### Furnace at position (1.0, 1.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace (position 1.0, 1.0).\n\n### Chest at position (3.5, 1.5)\nConsists of:\n- Wooden chest (position 3.5, 1.5).\n\n### Lab at position (6.5, 1.5)\nConsists of:\n- Lab (position 6.5, 1.5).\n\n### Burner inserter at position (8.5, 1.5)\nConsists of:\n- Burner inserter (position 8.5, 1.5).\n\n### Additional Chests\n- Wooden chest (position 3.5, 3.5).\n- Wooden chest (position 3.5, 5.5).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing steam engine\n- Ensure the target location for placing the steam engine is clear of obstructions or unplaceable terrain (e.g., water).\n\n### Errors with undefined names\n- Ensure that all necessary libraries and variables are properly defined before use, particularly when using built-in functions.\n\n### Errors when inspecting surrounding area\n- Verify that the function calls for inspecting the area are correctly implemented and that the required parameters are defined.\n\n### Errors when finding valid buildable positions\n- Check the area around the intended position for buildable space before attempting to place an entity. If no valid position is found, consider relocating the target position."}
