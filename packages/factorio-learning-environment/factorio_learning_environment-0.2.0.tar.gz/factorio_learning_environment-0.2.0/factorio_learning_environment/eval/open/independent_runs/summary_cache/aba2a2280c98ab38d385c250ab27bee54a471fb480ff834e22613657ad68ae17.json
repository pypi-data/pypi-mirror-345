{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (5.5, 21.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (5.5, 21.5)\n- Boiler at position (-1.5, 24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting offshore pump to boiler with water at positions [(x=-9.5, y=23.5), (x=-8.5, y=23.5), ..., (x=-3.5, y=23.5), (x=-3.5, y=24.5)]\n- PipeGroup connecting boiler to steam engine with steam at positions [(x=-1.5, y=22.5), (x=-0.5, y=22.5), ..., (x=3.5, y=24.5), (x=4.5, y=24.5), (x=5.5, y=24.5)]\n- ElectricityGroup with small electric poles at positions [(x=1.5, y=14.5), (x=1.5, y=2.5), (x=1.5, y=6.5), (x=1.5, y=10.5), (x=3.5, y=20.5)]\n\n### Copper Plate Production at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\n\n### Lab at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Lab with input for automation science pack and status as no research in progress\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Insufficient Resources\n- Ensure you have enough materials before attempting to craft items. For example, ensure you have enough wood and copper cables for crafting small electric poles.\n\n### Errors in Connecting Entities\n- Verify that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to connect entities, such as small electric poles for connecting steam engines to other structures.\n\n### Errors in Entity Definitions\n- Ensure that all entity types are correctly defined and available in your code. For instance, ensure the 'Lab' entity is correctly defined to avoid NameError exceptions.\n\n### Errors in Refueling\n- Maintain an adequate supply of coal to refuel boilers and ensure continuous operation of the electricity generator.\n\n### Errors in Pipe Connections\n- Double-check the connectivity of pipes between entities to ensure proper fluid flow, especially when connecting offshore pumps to boilers and boilers to steam engines.\n\n### Assertion Errors\n- Regularly check the status of critical entities like steam engines to ensure they are working as expected. Use assertions to validate their status and handle exceptions appropriately."}
