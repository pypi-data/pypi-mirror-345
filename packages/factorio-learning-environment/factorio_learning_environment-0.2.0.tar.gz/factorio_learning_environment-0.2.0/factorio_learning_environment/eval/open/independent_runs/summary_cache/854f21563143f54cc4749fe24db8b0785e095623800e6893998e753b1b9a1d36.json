(Step 113)\n- Ensure entities exist at the specified position before attempting to access or manipulate them. (Steps 115, 117, 118, 119)\n  - Specifically, check if a small-electric-pole exists at a position before trying to access it.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n- `get_entity(Prototype, position)`: Retrieves an entity of a specific prototype at a given position.\n  - Failure mode: Raises an exception if no entity of the specified type is found at the position. (Steps 115, 117, 118, 119)\n  - Success mode: Returns the entity if found.\n- Important variables:\n  - `pole.position`: Position of a small-electric-pole entity. (Type: Position)\n  - `Prototype.SmallElectricPole`: Prototype of a small-electric-pole entity. (Type: Prototype)"}
