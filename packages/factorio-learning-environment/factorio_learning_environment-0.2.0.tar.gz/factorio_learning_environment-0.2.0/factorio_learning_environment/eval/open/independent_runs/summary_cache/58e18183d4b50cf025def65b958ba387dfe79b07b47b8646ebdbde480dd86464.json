{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Setup at (-19, -50) and (-15, -50)\nTwo identical mining setups consisting of:\n- Burner mining drills at (-19, -50) and (-15, -50) mining iron ore\n- Wooden chests at (-18.5, -48.5) and (-14.5, -48.5) collecting mined ore\nBoth drills are operational with coal fuel and mining iron ore resources\n\n### Smelting Setup at (0,0) and (2,0)\nComplex smelting setup with:\n- Two stone furnaces at (0,0) and (2,0)\n- Input inserter system:\n  - Burner inserter at (-1.5, 0.5) with wooden chest at (-2.5, 0.5)\n  - Burner inserter at (3.5, 0.5) with wooden chest at (4.5, 0.5)\n- Output inserter system:\n  - Burner inserter at (0.5, 1.5) for first furnace\n  - Burner inserter at (2.5, 1.5) for second furnace\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Placement Distance Errors\n- Move closer to target location before placing entities - max placement distance is 10 tiles\n\n### Resource Area Errors\n- Verify resource patches exist before placing mining drills\n- Ensure mining drill placement overlaps with resource tiles\n\n### Entity Collision Errors  \n- Check target location is clear before placing entities\n- Increase spacing when placing entities next to existing ones\n- Consider different directions or reference positions if default placement fails\n\n### Missing Resources/Items Errors\n- Ensure required items are in inventory before placement/insertion\n- Gather raw resources (like wood) that cannot be crafted\n- Craft required items before attempting to place them\n\n### Inserter Setup Issues\n- Ensure output inserters have valid drop-off locations\n- Add fuel to burner inserters before use\n- Use correct API calls - entities must be passed as Entity objects, not Positions\n\n### Chest Management\n- Monitor and empty mining output chests regularly to prevent mining stoppage\n- Ensure input chests have materials for inserters to work with"}
