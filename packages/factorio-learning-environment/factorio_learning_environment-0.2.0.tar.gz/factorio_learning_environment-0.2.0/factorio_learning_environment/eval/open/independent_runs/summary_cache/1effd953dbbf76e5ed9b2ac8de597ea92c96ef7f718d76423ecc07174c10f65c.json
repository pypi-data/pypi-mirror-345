{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Setup (around position -8, -58)\nConsists of three parallel mining/smelting units:\n- Burner mining drill at (-10, -59) with furnace at (-9, -57)\n- Burner mining drill at (-8, -59) with furnace at (-7, -57)\n- Burner mining drill at (-6, -59) with furnace at (-5, -57)\nAll drills are working and mining iron ore, furnaces are processing iron plates\n\n### Coal Distribution System (around position 3, -1)\nFour parallel coal supply lines consisting of:\n- Wooden chests at (0.5, -2.5), (2.5, -2.5), (4.5, -2.5), and (6.5, -2.5) storing coal\n- Burner inserters at (0.5, -1.5), (2.5, -1.5), (4.5, -1.5), and (6.5, -1.5) moving coal\n- Stone furnaces at (0, 0), (2, 0), (4, 0), and (6, 0)\n\n### Iron Plate Collection System (around position 3, 1)\nCollection system for processed iron plates:\n- Wooden chests at (0.5, 2.5), (2.5, 1.5), (4.5, 1.5), and (6.5, 1.5) for storage\n- Burner inserters at (0.5, 1.5) and (7.5, 0.5) moving processed plates\n- One chest at (0.5, 2.5) currently contains 42 iron plates\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Output Blocking Issues\n- Mining drills show warnings about blocked outputs - ensure proper spacing between miners and furnaces to allow items to flow\n- Consider using inserters or transport belts to move items between miners and furnaces if direct dropping is problematic\n\n### Entity Placement Optimization\n- When placing furnaces, ensure they are exactly at the drop positions of mining drills (as seen in the fine-tuning steps)\n- Pay attention to the exact decimal positions (like -9.5, -57.5) when placing entities that need to interact\n\n### Resource Flow Management\n- Multiple furnaces show \"no ingredients to smelt\" warnings - ensure proper item flow from miners to furnaces\n- Consider adding inserters between miners and furnaces if direct dropping is not reliable\n\n### Fuel Management\n- While entities are currently fueled, maintain regular fuel checks and distribution to prevent work stoppage\n- Consider automating coal distribution to all burner entities"}
