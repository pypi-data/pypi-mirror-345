Verify both electrical connectivity and fuel levels for boilers.\n\u2003\u2013 The Boiler remains flagged NO_FUEL despite refueling; monitor fuel dispatch to maintain operations.\n\n\u2022 STEAM ENGINE CONNECTION AND REPOSITION:\n\u2003\u2013 Reposition attempts for the steam engine near the boiler failed due to insufficient inventory and missing sub-ingredients for crafting; confirm availability of required components before repositioning.\n\u2003\u2013 Ensure fluid connection points are unobstructed and properly aligned when integrating steam engines into the power network.\n\n\u2022 BURNER INSERTER FUEL MANAGEMENT:\n\u2003\u2013 Multiple burner inserters are issuing low fuel and \u201cout of fuel\u201d warnings. Review fuel distribution to guarantee timely refueling across the network.\n\n\u2022 TILE PLACEMENT & OCCUPANCY:\n\u2003\u2013 Several electric pole placement attempts were blocked due to existing entities (e.g. a burner inserter at (x=1.5, y=17.5) and a wooden-chest at (x=1.5, y=21.5)); verify target tile availability and adjust spacing/direction accordingly.\n\u2003\u2013 Similar occupancy errors affected manual belt placements; pre-validate unoccupied positions before placement.\n\n\u2022 ASSEMBLER POWER & EXTRACTION:\n\u2003\u2013 The assembling machine at (x=1.5, y=19.5) remains in a NO_POWER state despite multiple connection attempts (including a successful link to an existing pole at (x=3.5, y=19.5)), and subsequent extraction of iron\u2011gear\u2011wheels repeatedly fails. Confirm that power propagation is effective and production outputs are present before attempting extractions.\n\n\u2022 RESOURCE & CRAFTING SUPPLY:\n\u2003\u2013 Crafting of the steam engine failed owing to missing sub-ingredients (iron\u2011gear\u2011wheels and their precursor iron\u2011plates).
