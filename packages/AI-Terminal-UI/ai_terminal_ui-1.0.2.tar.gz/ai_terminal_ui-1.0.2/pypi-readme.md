### what it does:

this is a terminal based application for talking with llms.  
it supports extensible configuration, is user-friendly, undo/redo, etc.  

### how to run:

run ```bash ai-tui``` after installing

### argv:

run ```bash ai-tui -h```
the ones as of me writing this are -s | --skip and -o | --options
