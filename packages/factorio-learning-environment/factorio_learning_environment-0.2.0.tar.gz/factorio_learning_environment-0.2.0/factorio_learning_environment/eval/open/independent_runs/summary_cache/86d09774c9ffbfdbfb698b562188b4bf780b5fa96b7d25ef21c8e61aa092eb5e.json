{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-14.0, y=-48.0)\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=-13.5, y=-49.5) for transferring iron ore from the mining drill to the furnace.\n\nThis setup is designed to extract iron ore using the mining drill and smelt it into iron plates using the furnace. The inserter facilitates the transfer of iron ore from the mining drill to the furnace.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when crafting due to missing sub-ingredients\n- Ensure that all required sub-ingredients are available in the inventory before attempting to craft an item. For example, iron plates cannot be crafted directly and require smelting in a furnace.\n\n### Errors when inserting items without having them in inventory\n- Verify that the required items are present in the inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. For instance, iron ore must be gathered before it can be inserted into a furnace.\n\n### Errors when placing entities too far from the player\n- Move closer to the target position before attempting to place an entity. The maximum placement distance is 10 tiles.\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Check that the target tile is unoccupied before placing an entity. Adjust the spacing, direction, or reference position if necessary to avoid conflicts with existing entities."}
