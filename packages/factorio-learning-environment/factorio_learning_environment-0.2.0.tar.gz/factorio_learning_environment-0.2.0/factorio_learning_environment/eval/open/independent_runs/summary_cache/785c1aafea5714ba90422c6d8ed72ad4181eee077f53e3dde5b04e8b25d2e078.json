{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility at Position (-23.0, -68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) connected to a transport belt network\n- Wooden Chest at position (-23.5, -69.5) storing copper ore\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -70.0) smelting copper ore into copper plates\n- Burner Inserter at position (-16.5, -69.5) transferring items between chests\n\n### Iron Ore Mining Site at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) extracting iron ore\n- Wooden Chest at position (-12.5, -54.5) storing iron ore\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -54.5) transferring items between chests\n\n### Iron Plate Storage Facility at Position (-16.5, -64.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (-16.5, -64.5) storing iron plates\n- Burner Inserter at position (-15.5, -64.5) waiting for source items\n\n### Miscellaneous Storage and Processing\n- Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5) storing coal, iron ore, and iron plates\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n\n### Transport Belt Networks\n- Multiple BeltGroups connecting various entities across the map, facilitating the movement of resources between mining drills, furnaces, and chests.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### Errors due to missing resources\n- Ensure that all necessary resources are available in the required quantities before attempting to execute actions that depend on them. For example, ensure iron plates are available before attempting to find them on the surface.\n\n### Inserter Configuration Errors\n- Check the inserter's pickup and drop positions to ensure they are correctly aligned with source and destination entities to avoid misalignment issues.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entity has items available for the inserter to pick up to prevent it from waiting indefinitely.\n\n### Furnace No Ingredients Warning\n- Supply the furnace with the necessary ingredients to smelt to avoid idle time and warnings about no ingredients."}
