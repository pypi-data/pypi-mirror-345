There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Neighbours: Stone Furnace\n  - Drop Position: (x=-16.5, y=-52.5)\n  - Resources: Iron ore\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-14.0, y=-49.0)\n  - Fuel: Coal\n  - Status: Working\n  - Furnace Source: Iron ore\n  - Furnace Result: Iron plates\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied locations\n- Ensure you can place an entity at a desired location before attempting placement. Check for existing entities or obstacles that may block placement.\n\n### Errors with output blockage\n- Ensure there is a sink entity in place to accept the output from the burner mining drill. Clear any items blocking the drop position of the drill to maintain continuous production.\n\n### Errors with Transport Belt and Inserter placement\n- Verify that the desired location for placing transport belts and inserters is free from obstructions. Ensure proper alignment and connectivity with other entities to facilitate material transfer."}
