{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Structure\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0): This drill is responsible for extracting iron ore and is fueled by coal. It is currently working and has a neighbor relationship with a wooden chest and a burner inserter.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5): This chest stores the extracted iron ore from the burner mining drill. It currently contains 618 units of iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5): This inserter is responsible for transferring iron ore from the wooden chest to the stone furnace. It is currently working but has warnings of being out of fuel.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0): This furnace is intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates. However, it currently has no ingredients to smelt despite having coal as fuel.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Alignment Errors\n- Ensure that the inserter pickup and drop positions are correctly aligned with the source (chest) and destination (furnace) entities. Misalignment can prevent the inserter from functioning properly.\n\n### Fuel Management Errors\n- Regularly check the fuel levels of all entities that require fuel, such as the burner mining drill and burner inserter. Ensure they are refueled promptly to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Resource Availability Errors\n- Ensure that there are sufficient resources in the inventory before attempting to insert them into entities. For example, ensure coal is available in the inventory before trying to refuel entities.\n\n### Furnace Input Errors\n- Verify that the furnace is receiving the necessary ingredients (iron ore) for smelting. If the furnace is not receiving iron ore, check the inserter setup and alignment to ensure proper transfer of materials."}
