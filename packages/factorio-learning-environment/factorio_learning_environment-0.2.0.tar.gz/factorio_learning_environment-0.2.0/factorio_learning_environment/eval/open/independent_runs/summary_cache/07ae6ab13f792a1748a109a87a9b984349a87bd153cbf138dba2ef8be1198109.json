{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nCurrently, there are no structures created on the map. The execution logs indicate that the agent has attempted to place various entities such as stone furnaces, wooden chests, and transport belts, but these attempts were unsuccessful due to errors or obstacles. Therefore, no structures have been established yet.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied or invalid tiles\n- Ensure that the tile is unoccupied and valid for placement before attempting to place an entity. The agent encountered errors when trying to place a Stone Furnace at (50.0, 50.0), a Wooden Chest at (51.5, -82.0), (150.5, 150.5), (200.0, 200.0), and (10.5, 10.5), and a Transport Belt at (150.0, 150.0).\n\n### Errors due to obstacles in the environment\n- Conduct a thorough scan of the intended placement area to identify any obstacles that may prevent placement. Obstacles were found at multiple positions, such as around (145.0, 145.0) and (-19.5, -19.5).\n\n### Errors when using incorrect data types in code\n- Ensure that the correct data types are used in your code. The agent encountered an error in line 7 of a script where string indices were incorrectly used as integers.\n\n### Errors related to moving to a position\n- Verify that the move_to function is used with correct parameters and data types. The agent encountered an error when attempting to move to a position using a string index instead of an integer."}
