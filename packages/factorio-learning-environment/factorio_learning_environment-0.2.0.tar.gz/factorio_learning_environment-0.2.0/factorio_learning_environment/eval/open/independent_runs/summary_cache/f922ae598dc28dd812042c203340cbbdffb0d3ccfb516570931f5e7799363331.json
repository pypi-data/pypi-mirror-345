Multiple errors occurred when attempting to place boilers or steam engines with zero inventory.\n\u2003\u2013 Before crafting complex machinery, ensure all sub-ingredients (e.g. stone for stone-furnace construction and iron-plates for steam engines) are available, as crafting failures can cascade into placement failures.\n\n\u2022 Buildable Area and Position Calculation Errors:\n\u2003\u2013 Confirm the validity of computed buildable positions. Errors such as a TypeError from invoking a 'Position' object indicate issues in buildable area determination.\n\u2003\u2013 Pre-check that target tiles are free of obstructions to support successful placement.\n\n\u2022 Pipe Connection and Fluid System Issues:\n\u2003\u2013 Ensure sufficient pipe items are in inventory when establishing connections. Failures with pipe connection attempts (e.g. requiring 57 pipes with none available) necessitate inventory replenishment and careful planning of connection paths.\n\u2003\u2013 Validate spacing and clear paths when linking boilers to steam engines through pipes.\n\n\u2022 Electric Pole and Network Connection Issues:\n\u2003\u2013 Check that target tiles for electric poles are unoccupied and that the necessary number of poles is available. Errors arising from attempted connection of the Lab to an electric pole (requiring 6 poles but none available) highlight this need.\n\u2003\u2013 Maintain accurate entity references to prevent errors such as those involving 'NoneType' objects during pole placement.\n\n\u2022 General Inventory and Variable Management:\n\u2003\u2013 Continuously update inventory records after crafting and placement attempts to avoid referencing unavailable resources.\n\u2003\u2013 Use consistent variable names and validated reference points to prevent misdirected placement actions.\n\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n(NAMESPACE section omitted as no agent\u2010defined functions were identified.)"}
