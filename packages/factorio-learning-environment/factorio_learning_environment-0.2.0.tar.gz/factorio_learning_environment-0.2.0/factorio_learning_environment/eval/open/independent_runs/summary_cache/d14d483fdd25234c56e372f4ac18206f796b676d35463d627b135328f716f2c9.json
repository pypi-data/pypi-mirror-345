{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nThis facility is responsible for mining iron ore and smelting it into iron plates. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0) which extracts iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5) that transfers iron ore from the mining drill to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace 1** at position (-12.0, -48.0) which smelts the iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-14.5, -47.5) that moves items from the furnace to a storage chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5) which stores iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-15.5, -48.5) which stores iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -46.5) which stores iron plates.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage Facility\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-6.5, -48.5) which stores iron plates.\n\n### Iron Plate Transfer System\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-8.5, -47.5) that transfers iron plates from a storage chest to another location.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-7.5, -47.5) which temporarily stores iron plates.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-6.5, -47.5) which stores iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using inserters waiting for source items\n- Ensure the source entity has items available for the inserter to pick up. Check the connectivity and flow of items to avoid waiting states.\n\n### Errors when referencing undefined entities\n- Ensure that all entities you reference in your code are correctly defined and exist at the specified positions. Double-check entity names and positions to avoid undefined references.\n\n### Errors with inventory full\n- Before attempting to insert items into an entity, check the entity's inventory capacity to ensure there is enough space to accommodate the items.\n\n### Errors with unbound local variables\n- Ensure all variables are properly initialized before use. Avoid accessing local variables that have not been associated with a value to prevent `UnboundLocalError`.\n\n### Errors with no ingredients to smelt\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients available to smelt. Check the supply chain to ensure continuous input of resources."}
