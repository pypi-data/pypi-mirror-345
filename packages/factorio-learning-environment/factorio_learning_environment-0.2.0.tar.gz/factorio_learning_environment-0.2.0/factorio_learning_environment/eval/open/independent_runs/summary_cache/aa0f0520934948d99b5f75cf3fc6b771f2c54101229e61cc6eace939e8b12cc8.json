{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-18.5, 19.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position -18.5, 19.5), boiler (position -13.5, 20.0), and offshore pump (position -11.5, 26.5). The steam engine is currently not connected to the power network and has no input liquid, while the boiler is out of fuel.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(-18.0, -49.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace (position -18.0, -49.0) with coal as fuel and currently has 3 iron ore available for smelting.\n\n### Lab at position(-17.5, 23.5)\nThis structure is currently not engaged in any research and has 16 automation science packs in its input.\n\n### Assembling machine at position(-21.5, 25.5)\nThis assembling machine is not receiving electricity and cannot create automation science packs due to missing resources: copper plate and iron gear wheel.\n\n### Pipe groups\n- PipeGroup (fluid system 44129) at position (-12.5, 21.5) is full of water.\n- PipeGroup (fluid system 44126) at position (-18.5, 16.5) is empty.\n- PipeGroup (fluid system 44130) at position (-8.5, 21.5) is empty.\n- PipeGroup (fluid system 44132) at position (-10.5, 22.5) is empty.\n- PipeGroup (fluid system 44133) at position (-7.5, 23.5) is empty.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items into entities\n- Ensure you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into an entity. For example, the error occurred when trying to insert iron ore into the furnace without having any iron ore available in the inventory.\n\n### Errors when using incorrect argument types\n- Make sure to use the correct argument types when calling functions. The error occurred due to passing a Position instead of an Entity or EntityGroup when trying to insert items.\n\n### Errors when placing entities without power\n- Check that all machines requiring power are connected to a power network before attempting to use them. The assembling machine and steam engine are currently not receiving electricity.\n\n### Errors when attempting to smelt without ingredients\n- Ensure that the furnace has the necessary ingredients to smelt. The furnace at position (-18.0, -49.0) is currently unable to smelt due to insufficient ingredients."}
