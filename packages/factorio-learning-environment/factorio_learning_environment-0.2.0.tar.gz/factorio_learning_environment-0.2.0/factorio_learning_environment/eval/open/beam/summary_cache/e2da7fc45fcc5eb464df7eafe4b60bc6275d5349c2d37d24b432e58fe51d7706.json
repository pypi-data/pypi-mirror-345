{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Stone Furnace at position (3.0, 0.0)\n\nThese furnaces are used to smelt iron ore into iron plates. Both furnaces are currently fueled with coal and have been producing iron plates. However, they are currently not smelting due to a lack of ingredients.\n\n### Electricity Generator at position (-4.5, 24.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Boiler at position (-4.5, 24.0)\n- Steam Engine at position (-1.5, 24.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting the boiler to the steam engine\n\nThis setup is intended to generate electricity. The water supply has been connected to the boiler, but the steam engine is not operational due to connection issues and lack of input liquid.\n\n### Research Lab at position (6.5, 3.5)\nConsists of the following entity:\n- Lab at position (6.5, 3.5)\n\nThe lab is intended for research purposes. It has been connected to the steam engine but is currently not receiving power.\n\n### Pipe Network\nConsists of multiple PipeGroups at various positions:\n- PipeGroup at position (x=-14.5, y=13.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (x=-24.5, y=15.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (x=-8.5, y=15.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (x=-12.5, y=19.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (x=-8.5, y=19.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (x=1.5, y=18.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (x=-6.5, y=21.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (x=-3.5, y=21.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (x=-13.5, y=23.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (x=-10.5, y=23.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (x=-6.5, y=25.5)\n\nThese pipes are intended to connect various fluid systems but are currently empty and not operational.\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Small Electric Poles at various positions, including (x=1.5, y=8.5), (x=0.5, y=11.5), (x=3.5, y=6.5), (x=0.5, y=15.5), (x=0.5, y=19.5), (x=-2.5, y=23.5)\n\nThis network is intended to distribute electricity across the structures but is currently not operational due to lack of power generation.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities without having them in inventory\n- Ensure that the required entity is crafted and available in your inventory before attempting to place it on the map. For example, attempting to place a stone furnace or assembling machine without having them in inventory will result in an error.\n\n### Errors due to missing crafting prerequisites\n- Before crafting an item, ensure all prerequisite items and technologies are available. For instance, crafting a stone furnace requires stone, which must be gathered first. Similarly, crafting an assembling machine requires the automation technology to be researched.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into incompatible furnaces\n- Verify that the furnace is empty or contains compatible materials before inserting new materials. Attempting to insert copper ore into a furnace already containing iron ore will result in an error.\n\n### Errors when extracting items from entities without the items\n- Ensure that the entity contains the item you wish to extract. Attempting to extract copper plates from a furnace that only contains iron plates will lead to an error.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient ingredients for crafting\n- Check your inventory for all necessary ingredients before attempting to craft an item. For example, crafting a lab requires iron gear wheels, which must be crafted or gathered first.\n\n### Errors when placing entities in invalid locations\n- Ensure that the location is suitable for the entity's footprint. Attempting to place a boiler on water or overlapping with other entities will result in an error.\n\n### Errors when connecting entities without required items\n- Make sure you have the necessary items in your inventory to connect entities, such as pipes for connecting boilers and steam engines. Repeated attempts to connect pipes without having them in inventory will result in errors.\n\n### Errors when crafting items requiring raw resources\n- Gather raw resources like wood and stone directly from the environment as they cannot be crafted. For example, crafting small electric poles requires wood, which must be gathered first.\n\n### Errors due to lack of operational power network\n- Ensure that the power network is operational by checking connections and ensuring that the electricity generator is functional. The lab and steam engine are not receiving power due to connection issues."}
