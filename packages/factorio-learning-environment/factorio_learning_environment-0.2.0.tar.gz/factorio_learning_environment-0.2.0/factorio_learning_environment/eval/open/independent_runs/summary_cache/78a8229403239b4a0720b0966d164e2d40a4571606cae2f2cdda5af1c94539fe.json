{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=0.5, y=28.0)\nConsists of:\n- Boiler at position (x=0.5, y=28.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-3.5, y=27.5)\n- Steam Engine at position (x=7.5, y=39.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting the offshore pump to the boiler\n\n### Coal Mining and Processing Facility at Position (x=40.0, y=-84.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=40.0, y=-84.0)\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=40.5, y=-82.5) for storing coal\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=54.5, y=-83.5) for transferring coal\n- BeltGroup for transporting coal\n\n### Iron Plate Storage Facility\nConsists of:\n- Iron Chest at position (x=0.5, y=0.5) with 1550 iron plates\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=-15.0, y=-49.0) with copper plates\n\n### Laboratory\nConsists of:\n- Lab with input for automation science packs\n\n### Pipe Network\nMultiple PipeGroups for fluid transport, with notable positions:\n- PipeGroup at position (x=-3.5, y=26.5) for water transport\n- Additional PipeGroups for fluid distribution\n\n### Electricity Network\nConsists of:\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at various positions, including (x=7.5, y=13.5) and (x=9.5, y=39.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Fuel Management\n- Ensure all boilers and mining drills have sufficient fuel to maintain operation. Regularly check fuel levels and replenish as necessary.\n\n### Errors with Inventory Management\n- Regularly empty full chests to prevent production halts. Ensure there is adequate storage space for mined resources.\n\n### Errors with Power Connectivity\n- Ensure all power-generating structures are connected to the power network. Check connections between steam engines and electric poles.\n\n### Errors with Fluid Systems\n- Check that all fluid systems are properly connected and have the necessary input and output connections to function efficiently."}
