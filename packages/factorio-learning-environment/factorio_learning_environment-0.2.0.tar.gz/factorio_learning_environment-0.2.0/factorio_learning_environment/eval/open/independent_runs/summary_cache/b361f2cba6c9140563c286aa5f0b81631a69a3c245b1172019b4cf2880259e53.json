{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0): This drill is responsible for mining iron ore and is refueled with coal.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5): This chest stores the mined iron ore, currently containing 455 units of iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5): This inserter is aligned to transfer iron ore from the wooden chest to the furnace. It is refueled with coal and is currently waiting for source items.\n\n### Iron Smelting Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0): This furnace is intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates. However, it is currently not receiving iron ore due to an issue with the inserter setup.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Inserter Setup\n- Ensure that the inserter is correctly aligned and positioned to transfer items from the source (wooden chest) to the destination (furnace). Regularly check the inserter's setup to ensure it is functioning as intended.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Resources\n- Before attempting to insert items into entities, verify that the required resources are available in your inventory. For example, ensure coal is available before trying to refuel entities.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Ingredients\n- Investigate and resolve any issues in the supply chain that prevent the furnace from receiving the necessary ingredients (iron ore) for smelting. This may involve checking the alignment and functionality of inserters and ensuring that the source (wooden chest) contains the required materials."}
