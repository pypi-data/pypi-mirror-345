{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates. Currently fueled with coal and actively working.\n- **Burner Inserter 1** at position (1.5, 0.5) transferring iron plates from the furnace to a wooden chest. It is waiting for source items.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (2.5, 0.5) storing iron plates. Contains 19 iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter 2** at position (3.5, 0.5) extracting iron plates from the wooden chest and placing them onto a transport belt.\n- **Transport Belt** connecting the inserter at position (3.5, 0.5) to another inserter at position (6.5, 0.5). It is moving iron plates along the belt.\n- **Burner Inserter 3** at position (6.5, 0.5) transferring iron plates from the transport belt to an end wooden chest.\n- **End Wooden Chest** at position (7.5, 0.5) collecting iron plates from the belt. Contains 17 iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Ensure the target tile is free before placing an entity. Consider adjusting spacing or direction if an entity already exists at the intended position.\n\n### Errors when connecting belts directly from a chest\n- Use an inserter to extract items from a chest before connecting them to a transport belt. Direct connections from a chest to a belt are not possible.\n\n### Errors due to lack of required items in inventory\n- Ensure you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to place or craft entities. Gather raw resources like wood before crafting items that require them.\n\n### Errors when crafting without available recipes\n- Verify that the required sub-ingredients for crafting are available and that the recipe exists. Raw resources must be gathered if they cannot be crafted."}
