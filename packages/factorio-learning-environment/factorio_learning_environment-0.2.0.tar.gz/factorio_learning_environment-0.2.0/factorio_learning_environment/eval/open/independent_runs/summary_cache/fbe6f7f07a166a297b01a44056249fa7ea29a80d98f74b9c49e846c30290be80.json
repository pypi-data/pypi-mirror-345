{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production at Position (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) with a drop position at (41.5, -80.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (43.0, -82.0)\n- Iron Chests at positions (41.5, -80.5) and (42.5, -80.5)\n- Burner Inserter at position (43.5, -80.5) transferring items between the chests and the furnace\n\n### Iron Ore Extraction at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) with a drop position at (-14.5, -48.5)\n- Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0)\n- Iron Chests at positions (-16.5, -48.5), (-14.5, -48.5), and (-15.5, -48.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Storage and Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Multiple Iron Chests positioned at various coordinates such as (-29.5, -49.5), (-18.5, -48.5), (-12.5, -45.5), etc., storing iron plates and other resources\n- Burner Inserters at positions like (-12.5, -44.5), (-10.5, -44.5), (-8.5, -44.5) facilitating the transfer of items between chests\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Extracting Items with Insufficient Quantity\n- Ensure that the quantity of items you attempt to extract is greater than zero. Check the inventory of the source entity before attempting extraction.\n\n### Errors with Full Chests Blocking Mining Operations\n- Regularly check and empty chests at drop positions to prevent mining drills from halting operations due to full inventories.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that source entities have the required items for inserters to transfer. Keep track of inventory levels to avoid idle inserters.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Running Out of Fuel\n- Monitor the fuel levels of burner inserters to prevent them from stopping due to lack of fuel. Regular refueling is necessary to maintain continuous operation."}
