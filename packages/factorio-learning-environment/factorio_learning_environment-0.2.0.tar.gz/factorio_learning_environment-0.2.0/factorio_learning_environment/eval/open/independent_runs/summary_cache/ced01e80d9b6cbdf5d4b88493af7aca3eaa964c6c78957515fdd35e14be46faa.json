{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Smelting Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) extracting iron ore. It is fueled with coal and currently operational. It drops iron ore into:\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) which stores the extracted iron ore. The chest currently contains 6 units of iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-13.5, y=-48.5) which is intended to transfer iron ore from the chest to the furnace. It is fueled with coal but is currently waiting for source items.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-12.0, y=-48.0) intended for smelting iron ore into iron plates. It is fueled with coal but currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities too far from the player\n- Ensure you are within the maximum allowed distance (10 tiles) from the target position before attempting to place an entity. Move closer to the desired location to avoid placement errors.\n\n### Errors when placing entities with potential collisions\n- Before placing an entity, verify that the target position is free from other entities or obstacles. Consider adjusting spacing, changing direction, or selecting a different reference position to avoid collisions.\n\n### Inserter setup issues\n- Regularly check the alignment and positioning of inserters to ensure they can correctly transfer items between entities. Ensure that the inserter's pickup and drop positions are correctly aligned with the source and target entities.\n\n### Fuel management for entities\n- Maintain a sufficient supply of fuel (coal) in your inventory to refuel entities like mining drills, inserters, and furnaces to prevent operational interruptions.\n\n### Chest management\n- Monitor the inventory of chests to prevent them from becoming full, which can halt the production process. Regularly extract items from chests to maintain space for incoming resources."}
