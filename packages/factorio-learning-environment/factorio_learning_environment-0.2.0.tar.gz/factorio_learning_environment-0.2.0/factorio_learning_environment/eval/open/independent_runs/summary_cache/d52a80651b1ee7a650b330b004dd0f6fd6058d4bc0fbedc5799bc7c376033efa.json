{"content": "# Factorio Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Stone Furnace at position (0, 0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace (position (0, 0)) with fuel (coal: 18) and status (no ingredients to smelt).\n  \n### Stone Furnace at position (2, 0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone furnace (position (2, 0)) with fuel (coal: 7) and status (no ingredients to smelt).\n\n### Wooden Chest at position (3.5, 0.5)\nConsists of:\n- Wooden chest (position (3.5, 0.5)) with inventory (copper-plate: 4).\n\n### Lab at position (0, 1)\nConsists of:\n- Lab (position (0, 1)) with lab input (automation-science-pack: 10) and status (no power, research: automation).\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when crafting Assembling Machine\n- The recipe for assembling-machine-1 is not unlocked yet (requires automation technology). Research the required technology before attempting to craft.\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure that the entity you are trying to place is available in your inventory before attempting to place it. For example, a burner inserter was not found in the inventory when trying to place it.\n\n### Errors when accessing entities\n- Ensure that the entity you are trying to access exists at the specified position. For example, a lab was not found at the specified position (0, 1) and a steam engine was not found at (1, -1).\n\n### Errors related to power supply\n- Ensure that your lab and other electrical entities are connected to a power source. The lab is currently showing a status of no power. \n\n### NameError in code\n- Check for proper naming of classes and variables in your code. For instance, 'Electric' was not defined, indicating a possible typo or incorrect reference."}
