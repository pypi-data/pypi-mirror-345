{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-14.0, y=-53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-14.0, y=-53.0)\n- Transport Belts connecting the mining drill to a Wooden Chest at Position (-14.5, y=-54.5)\n- Burner Inserter at Position (-13.5, y=-54.5) transferring items from the chest\n- Transport Belts extending from Position (-15.5, y=-54.5) to Position (-12.5, y=-51.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-19.0, y=-65.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-19.0, y=-65.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n- Burner Inserter at Position (-17.5, y=-64.5) waiting for source items\n- Wooden Chest at Position (-16.5, y=-64.5) containing iron plates\n- Transport Belts connecting the furnace to the chest\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Storage Facility at Position (-23.0, y=-68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (-23.0, y=-68.0)\n- Transport Belts connecting the mining drill to a Wooden Chest at Position (-23.5, y=-69.5)\n- Additional Wooden Chest at Position (-24.5, y=-67.5) for storage\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (53.0, y=-83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at Position (53.0, y=-83.0) with no fuel\n- Wooden Chest at Position (52.5, y=-84.5) containing coal\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (0.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at Position (0.0, y=0.0) with no ingredients to smelt\n- Wooden Chest at Position (1.5, y=0.5) containing coal and iron plates\n- Burner Inserter at Position (2.5, y=0.5) waiting for source items\n- Additional Wooden Chest at Position (3.5, y=0.5) for storage\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Belt Placement and Connectivity\n- Ensure continuous placement of transport belts without gaps to maintain connectivity between entities. Check for gaps at positions like (-12.5, y=-53.5) and ensure belts are placed correctly to connect entities.\n\n### Errors with Inserter Operations\n- Ensure that the destination for inserters is not blocked. Clear any items on the ground or ensure a sink entity is in place to accept the output, especially for inserters at positions like (-13.5, y=-54.5).\n\n### Errors with Entity Connections\n- When connecting entities using belts, ensure that all positions are correctly indexed and that there are no nil values in the connection process, as seen in the error at line 23.\n\n### Errors with Fuel Management\n- Regularly refuel burner mining drills and inserters to prevent them from running out of fuel and halting operations, as seen with drills at positions like (53.0, y=-83.0) and (-23.0, y=-68.0)."}
