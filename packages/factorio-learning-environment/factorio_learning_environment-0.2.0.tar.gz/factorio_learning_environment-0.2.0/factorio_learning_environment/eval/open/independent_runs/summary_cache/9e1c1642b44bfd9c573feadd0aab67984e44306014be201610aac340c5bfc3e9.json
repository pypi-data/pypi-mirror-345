{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=1.5, y=27.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=1.5, y=27.5), which is currently not connected to any fluid source.\n- Boiler at position (x=-2.5, y=25.0), which is out of fuel and not connected to the steam engine.\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-7.5, y=25.5), which is working and connected to a pipe network.\n- PipeGroup (fluid_system=11947) at position (x=-6.5, y=24.5), which is full and transporting water.\n- PipeGroup (fluid_system=11950) at position (x=-0.5, y=27.5), which is empty.\n- PipeGroup (fluid_system=11949) at position (x=0.5, y=30.5), which is empty.\n- ElectricityGroup with poles distributed across various positions, currently with zero voltage.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Connecting Boiler to Steam Engine\n- Ensure that there are no obstructions in the path when connecting the boiler to the steam engine. Clear any pipes or other entities that might be in the way.\n- Verify that the pipe-to-ground can be placed at the intended location. If there is an existing object, reposition or remove it before attempting to place the pipe-to-ground.\n\n### Steam Engine Not Connected\n- Check that the steam engine is properly connected to the boiler and that there is a continuous path for the steam to travel.\n- Make sure that the boiler is fueled and operational to produce steam for the engine.\n\n### Errors with Entity Placement\n- Before placing an entity, ensure that the target tile is unoccupied and suitable for the entity type.\n- Reposition entities if necessary to create a clear path for connections and operations."}
