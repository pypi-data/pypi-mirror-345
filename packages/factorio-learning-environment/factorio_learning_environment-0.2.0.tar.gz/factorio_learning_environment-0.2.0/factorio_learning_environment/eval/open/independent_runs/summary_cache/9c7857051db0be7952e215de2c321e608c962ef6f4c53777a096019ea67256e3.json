{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System (Updated)\n- **Steam engine** at (22.5, 22.5) - Still disconnected from power network with warnings: \"not connected to power network\", \"no input liquid\", \"no fluid present in connections\"\n- **Small electric pole** at (22.5, 20.5) - Adjacent to steam engine but not properly connected\n\n### Chemical Production Complex (Updated)\n- **Chemical plant** at (37.5, 22.5) - Configured for sulfur production but still showing NO_POWER status despite pole at (35.5, 21.5)\n- **Wooden chest** at (40.5, 22.5) - Output container for sulfur production\n- **Pipe network** connecting chemical plant to:\n  - Pipe at (39.5, 23.5)\n  - Extended pipe system spanning to (24.5, 38.5)\n\n### Oil Processing Facility\n- **Oil refinery** at (27.5, 40.5) - Still showing NO_POWER status with crude oil input at (30.5, 39.5) and petroleum gas output at (24.5, 38.5)\n- **Connected pipe network** spanning from (24.5, 37.5) to (39.5, 23.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Persistent Water System Issues (Updated)\n- **Water boundary detection** - Still failing to properly verify water positions before placement (Steps 104,105,107,110)\n- **Extreme coordinate attempts** - Repeatedly trying invalid positions (-50,-50) and (50,50) (Steps 105,107,110)\n- **Position assertion failures** - Still not implementing fallback positions when primary fails (Steps 104,111)\n\n### New Infrastructure Problems\n- **Entity existence verification** - Attempting to access non-existent boilers (Step 109)\n- **Power connection validation** - Not properly verifying power status before asserting (Step 108)\n- **Output placement conflicts** - Not checking for existing chests before placement (Step 106)\n\n### Critical System Design Flaws\n- **No progress tracking** - Still clearing infrastructure without completing systems\n- **No validation loops** - Not implementing retry logic with position adjustments\n- **No system verification** - Still not confirming successful placements before proceeding\n\n### Power System Issues\n- **Network isolation** - Steam engine remains disconnected despite nearby poles\n- **Voltage monitoring** - Still not implemented (all networks show 0 voltage)\n- **Connection validation** - Not verifying power connections after pole placement\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Functions\n- `verify_power_connection()` - Needs voltage validation enhancement\n- `find_valid_water_position()` - New critical requirement from recent failures\n- `validate_entity_existence()` - New requirement from Step 109 errors\n- `get_safe_placement_position()` - Needs obstacle and boundary checking\n\n### Variables\n- `water_pos` - Still causing placement failures\n- `power_pole_positions` - Needs updating with actual connected poles\n- `placement_attempts` - Still not implemented despite clear need\n- `system_validation_flags` - New variable needed for state tracking"}
