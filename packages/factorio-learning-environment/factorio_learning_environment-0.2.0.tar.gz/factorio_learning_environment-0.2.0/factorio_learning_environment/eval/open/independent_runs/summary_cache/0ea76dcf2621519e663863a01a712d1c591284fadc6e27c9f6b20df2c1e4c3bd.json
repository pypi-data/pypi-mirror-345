Verify and use the active fluid_system (currently 34164) that is configured for the boiler, offshore pump, and PipeGroup network.\n- Inflexible Pipeline Stabilization Strategy:\n  \u2022 The fixed 10-second wait period for pipeline stabilization causes unnecessary delays. Implement dynamic connectivity checks to proceed as soon as stabilization is confirmed."}
