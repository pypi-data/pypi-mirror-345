{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Iron Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) fueled by coal, currently working with iron ore as input.\n- Burner Inserter at position (1.5, 0.5) transferring items from a wooden chest to the iron furnace.\n- Wooden Chest at position (2.5, 0.5) used as an intermediary storage.\n- Burner Inserter at position (3.5, 0.5) waiting for source items, intended to transfer items from the wooden chest to a transport belt.\n- Transport Belt at position (4.5, 0.5) functioning properly, intended to move items along the production line.\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Copper Furnace at position (10.0, 0.0) fueled by coal, currently working with copper ore as input.\n- Burner Inserter at position (11.5, 0.5) transferring items from the copper furnace to a wooden chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (12.5, 0.5) storing copper plates produced by the copper furnace.\n\n### Coal Mining Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) fueled by coal, currently working with a wooden chest at the drop position.\n- Wooden Chest at position (40.5, -83.5) storing extracted coal, currently full.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserters Not Finding Entities\n- Ensure that there is a valid entity at the inserter's pickup position before attempting to use the inserter. This includes ensuring that the source entity is not empty or missing.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Make sure that the source entity for the inserter is stocked with items to avoid the inserter waiting for source items.\n\n### Errors with Transport Belts\n- Verify that the transport belt is correctly placed and contains the expected items before attempting to extract items from it.\n\n### Errors with Entity Placement\n- Double-check the placement of entities to ensure they are correctly positioned and connected to the intended production line or facility.\n\n### Errors with Extracting Items from Belts\n- Ensure that the transport belt contains the specific items you intend to extract before attempting extraction."}
