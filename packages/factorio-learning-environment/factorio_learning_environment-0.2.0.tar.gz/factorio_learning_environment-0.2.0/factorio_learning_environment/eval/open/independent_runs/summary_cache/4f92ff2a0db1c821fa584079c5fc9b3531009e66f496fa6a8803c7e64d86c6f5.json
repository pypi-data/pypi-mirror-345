Consider increasing spacing, changing direction, or changing the reference position to avoid collisions with existing entities.\n\n### Errors when placing entities in restricted areas\n- Avoid attempting to place entities in areas that may have collisions with existing entities or are not suitable for placement (e.g., water). Adjust spacing, direction, or reference position accordingly."}
