{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System\nConsists of:\n- Steam engine at (-4.5, 12.5)\n- Boiler at (-4.5, 16.0)\n- Offshore pump at (-3.5, 27.5)\n- Connected by pipe groups carrying water and steam\n- Connected to electricity network (id=9538) powering various entities\n\n### Iron Mining and Smelting Complex\nMultiple mining and smelting stations:\n1. First station:\n- Burner mining drill at (-28.0, -61.0)\n- Storage chest at (-27.5, -59.5)\n- Burner inserter at (-26.5, -59.5)\n- Stone furnace at (-25.0, -59.0)\n\n2. Second station:\n- Burner mining drill at (-18.0, -53.0)\n- Storage chest at (-17.5, -51.5)\n- Burner inserter at (-16.5, -51.5)\n- Stone furnace at (-15.0, -51.0)\n\n### Coal Mining System\n- Burner mining drill at (41.0, -82.0)\n- Storage chest at (41.5, -80.5)\n- Burner inserter at (41.5, -79.5)\n\n### Automation Science Pack Production Line\n- Input storage chest at (5.5, 13.5)\n- Burner inserter at (6.5, 13.5)\n- Assembling machine at (8.5, 13.5)\n- Output burner inserter at (10.5, 13.5)\n- Output chest at (11.5, 13.5)\n- Connected by belt groups for material transport\n- Research lab connected to electricity network\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Resource Extraction Errors\n- Ensure storage chests contain the required items before attempting extraction\n- Verify the correct chest positions when trying to extract items\n\n### Fuel Management Errors\n- Keep track of coal inventory before attempting to insert fuel\n- Maintain adequate coal supply for all burner entities\n- Consider implementing a fuel distribution priority system\n\n### Production Line Issues\n- Monitor ingredient levels in assembling machines\n- Ensure consistent supply of raw materials (copper plates, iron gear wheels)\n- Verify all components of production chains are properly fueled and connected\n\n### Inventory Management\n- Implement inventory checks before attempting item transfers\n- Maintain minimum resource thresholds for critical materials\n- Monitor storage chest contents regularly\n\n### Power System Management\n- Keep boilers fueled to maintain consistent power supply\n- Monitor steam engine status and efficiency\n- Ensure proper fluid flow through the power generation system"}
