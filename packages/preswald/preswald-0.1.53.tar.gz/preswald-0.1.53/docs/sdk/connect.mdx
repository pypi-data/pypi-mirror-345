description: "Initialize and connect to configured data sources in preswald.toml"
---

```python
connect() -> duckdb.DuckDBPyConnection
```

The `connect` function brings together all the data sources defined in `preswald.toml`. It initializes connections to configured data sources and returns a DuckDB connection object that serves as the unified query interface.

## Returns

- `duckdb.DuckDBPyConnection`: the same connect object returned if you run `duckdb.connect()`. Note, while you can use this object directly, it's not the supported path and it's better to use `preswald.get_df` and `preswald.query`

## Supported Sources

### CSV

CSV sources can be configured with the following parameters:

```toml
[data.source_name]
type = "csv"
path = "path/to/file.csv"  # Path to the CSV file
```

The CSV source supports:
- Automatic type inference via DuckDB's `read_csv_auto`
- Direct SQL querying capabilities
- Full DataFrame conversion

### Postgres

PostgreSQL sources require the following configuration:

```toml
[data.source_name]
type = "postgres"
host = "localhost"     # PostgreSQL server hostname
port = 5432           # Server port
dbname = "database"   # Database name
user = "username"     # Database user
```

Features:
- Uses DuckDB's postgres_scanner extension
- Supports schema-qualified table names
- Enables direct SQL querying of PostgreSQL tables
- Provides DataFrame conversion for specific tables

### Clickhouse

ClickHouse sources can be configured with these parameters:

```toml
[data.source_name]
type = "clickhouse"
host = "localhost"     # ClickHouse server hostname
port = 8123           # HTTP port
database = "default"  # Database name
user = "default"      # Username
secure = false        # Optional: Enable HTTPS
verify = true         # Optional: Verify SSL certificates
```

Features:
- Utilizes DuckDB's ClickHouse scanner extension
- Supports both HTTP and HTTPS connections
- Enables direct SQL querying
- Provides DataFrame conversion capabilities

## Usage Example

`connect` only needs to be called once in the app, before any use of `preswald.data` functions. Here's an example of how to add `connect` to your app:

```toml
# preswald.toml
...
[data.eq_clickhouse]
type = "clickhouse"
host = "localhost"
port = 8123
database = "default"
user = "default"

[data.eq_pg]
type = "postgres"
host = "localhost"            # PostgreSQL host
port = 5432                   # PostgreSQL port
dbname = "earthquakes"        # Database name
user = "user"                 # Username

[data.eq_csv]
type = "csv"
path = "data/customers.csv"

...

#secrets.toml
...
[data.eq_clickhouse]
password = ""

[data.earthquake_db]
password = ""
...
```

```python
# hello.py
from preswald import connect

connect() # after this, eq_csv, eq_pg, and eq_clickhouse are all query-able data sources available with other preswald.data functions
```

### Key Features

1. **Unified Query Interface**: Access all data sources through a single DuckDB connection
2. **Automatic Extension Loading**: Required DuckDB extensions are automatically installed and loaded
3. **Secure Configuration**: Supports separate secrets file for sensitive credentials
4. **Error Handling**: Robust error handling for connection and query operations
5. **Logging**: Comprehensive logging of connection and query operations

### Best Practices

1. Call `connect()` once at application startup
2. Store credentials in `secrets.toml` separate from main configuration
3. Use `preswald.query()` and `preswald.get_df()` instead of direct DuckDB connection
4. Check returned source names to verify successful connections
