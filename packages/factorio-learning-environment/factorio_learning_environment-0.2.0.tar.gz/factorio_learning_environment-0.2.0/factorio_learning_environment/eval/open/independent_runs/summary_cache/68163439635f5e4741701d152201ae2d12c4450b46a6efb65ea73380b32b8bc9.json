{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=42.0, y=-83.0)\n  - Fuel: 6 units of coal\n  - Status: Working\n  - Warnings: Output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\n  - Neighbours: Transport belt at position (x=43.5, y=-82.5), Burner inserter at position (x=42.5, y=-81.5)\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=42.5, y=-81.5)\n  - Fuel: 50 units of coal\n  - Status: Waiting for source items\n  - Warnings: Chest is full\n  - Neighbours: Burner mining drill at position (x=42.0, y=-83.0), Transport belt at position (x=43.5, y=-82.5)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-15.0, y=-49.0)\n  - Fuel: 5 units of coal\n  - Status: Working\n  - Furnace Source: 40 units of iron ore\n  - Furnace Result: 74 units of iron plate\n\n### Transport Belt System\n- **Belt Group**:\n  - Inputs: Belt from (x=42.5, y=-82.5) to (x=44.5, y=-82.5), direction: Right\n  - Outputs: Belt from (x=43.5, y=-80.5) to (x=42.5, y=-79.5), direction: Left\n  - Status: Empty\n  - Consists of 7 belts\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities\n- Ensure that the intended position for placing entities like Wooden Chests and Transport Belts is not already occupied by another entity. This will prevent placement errors.\n\n### Errors when extending transport belts\n- Verify that the path for extending transport belts is clear and that there are no obstructions or misalignments in the intended direction.\n\n### Errors with output blockage\n- Ensure that there is a sink entity available to accept the output from production entities like the Burner Mining Drill to prevent blockage warnings.\n\n### Errors with inserters waiting for source items\n- Ensure that the source entity is supplying items to the inserter and that the inserter's destination is not full to avoid waiting status."}
