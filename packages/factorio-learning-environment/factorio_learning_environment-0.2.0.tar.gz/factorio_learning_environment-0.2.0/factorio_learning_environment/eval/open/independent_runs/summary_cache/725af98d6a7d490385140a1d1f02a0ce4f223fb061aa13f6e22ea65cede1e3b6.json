{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report (Steps 96-103)\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at position (14.5, 8.0)\nConsists of:\n- Boiler at (14.5, 8.0) (status: FULL_OUTPUT)\n- Steam engine at (17.5, 8.5) (status: NOT_CONNECTED)\n- Small electric poles at (19.5, 9.5) and (17.5, 11.5)\n- Partial water pipe connection from offshore pumps\n\n### Secondary Boiler at position (14.5, 11.0)\nConsists of:\n- Boiler at (14.5, 11.0) (status: NOT_CONNECTED)\n- Connected to pipe at (15.5, 9.5) (status: EMPTY)\n- No steam engine or proper connections\n\n### New Boiler at position (5.5, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Boiler at (5.5, 0.0) (status: NOT_CONNECTED, warnings: no input liquid)\n- Connection points at (3.5, 0.5) and (7.5, 0.5)\n- Steam output point at (5.5, -1.5)\n\n### Western Boiler Complex at (-7.5, -2.0)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at (-9.5, -2.5) (status: NOT_CONNECTED)\n- Boiler at (-7.5, -2.0) (status: NOT_CONNECTED)\n- Failed connection attempts between (-9.5, -2.5) and (-7.5, -2.0)\n\n### Oil Processing Complex\nConsists of:\n- Oil refinery at (15.5, 15.5) (status: NO_POWER, recipe: BasicOilProcessing)\n- Pumpjack at (17.5, 40.5) (status: NO_POWER)\n- Partial pipe network for crude oil (status: EMPTY)\n- Storage tank at (10.5, 15.5)\n- Missing power connections throughout\n\n### Chemical Plant Complex at position (6.5, 12.5)\nConsists of:\n- Chemical plant (status: NO_POWER, recipe: sulfur)\n- Small electric poles at (8.5, 10.5), (8.5, 13.5), and (7.5, 14.5)\n- Missing petroleum gas input and power\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Persistent Placement Issues\n- Attempted boiler placement at (-7.5, -2.5) on unplaceable terrain (step 96)\n- Repeated offshore pump placement attempts at distant locations (50,48) and (200,198) (steps 99, 101)\n- Move within 10 tile range before attempting placements\n- Verify terrain suitability before placing entities\n\n### Fluid Connection Problems\n- Multiple failed connections between offshore pump (-9.5,-2.5) and boilers (steps 97, 98, 100, 102)\n- Fluid mismatch between pipe (15.5,9.5) and boiler (15.5,11.0) (step 103)\n- Ensure proper alignment of connection points\n- Verify fluid types match between connected entities\n\n### Persistent Issues from Previous Reports\n- Placement on occupied/unplaceable tiles (still occurring)\n- Power grid connectivity (still occurring)\n- Connection point index errors (still occurring)\n- Fluid system validation (still occurring)"}
