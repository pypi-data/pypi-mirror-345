The drop chest is used to temporarily store items when the player's inventory is full.\n\n---\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when attempting to transfer coal to the player inventory\n- **Error**: Failed to extract coal from the coal chest due to inventory being full or other issues.\n- **Solution**: Ensure the player's inventory has space before attempting to transfer coal. Drop unnecessary items to free up space.\n\n#### Errors when attempting to insert coal into the mining drill\n- **Error**: Failed to insert coal into the mining drill due to no coal in the player's inventory.\n- **Solution**: Ensure coal is successfully transferred to the player's inventory before attempting to insert it into the mining drill.\n\n#### Errors when attempting to harvest coal\n- **Error**: Failed to harvest coal due to the player's inventory being full.\n- **Solution**: Free up inventory space by dropping items or transferring them to storage before attempting to harvest coal.\n\n#### Errors when attempting to free up inventory space\n- **Error**: Repeatedly picking up items from the drop chest without effectively freeing up space.\n- **Solution**: Drop items that are not immediately needed and avoid picking them back up unnecessarily.\n\n---\n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n#### Utility Functions\n- **`transfer_coal_to_inventory()`**: Attempts to transfer coal from the coal chest to the player's inventory.\n  - **Failure Modes**: Fails if the player's inventory is full or if the coal chest is empty.\n  - **Success Modes**: Successfully transfers coal to the player's inventory when there is space.\n\n- **`insert_coal_into_mining_drill()`**: Attempts to insert coal from the player's inventory into the mining drill.\n  - **Failure Modes**: Fails if there is no coal in the player's inventory.\n  - **Success Modes**: Successfully inserts coal into the mining drill when coal is available.\n\n- **`free_up_inventory_space()`**: Attempts to free up space in the player's inventory by dropping items.\n  - **Failure Modes**: Fails if the drop chest is full or if no items are dropped.\n  - **Success Modes**: Successfully frees up space when items are dropped into the drop chest.\n\n#### Important Variables\n- **`player_inventory`**: Dict containing the player's current inventory items and their quantities.\n- **`coal_chest`**: Dict containing the contents of the coal chest at position (-28.5, -62.5).\n- **`drop_chest`**: Dict containing the contents of the drop chest at position (-27.5, -59.5).\n- **`mining_drill_status`**: Status of the mining drill at position (-28.0, -61.0), including warnings and fuel status."}
