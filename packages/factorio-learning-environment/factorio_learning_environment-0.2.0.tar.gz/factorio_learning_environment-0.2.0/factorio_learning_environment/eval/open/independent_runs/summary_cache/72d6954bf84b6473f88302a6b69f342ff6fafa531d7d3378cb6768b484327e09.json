{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (52.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (52.0, -82.0) with a warning of \"output blocked by item on the ground.\"\n- Wooden Chest at position (53.5, -80.5) connected to the mining drill.\n- Burner Inserter at position (52.5, -79.5) with a warning \"chest at drop position is full.\"\n- Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -78.5) which is full with coal inventory.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility at Position (-12.0, -51.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-12.0, -51.0) with a warning \"chest at drop position is full.\"\n- Stone Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0) with a warning \"no ingredients to smelt.\"\n- Wooden Chest at position (-11.5, -49.5) storing iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-11.5, -48.5) waiting for source items.\n- Additional Burner Inserters at positions (-8.5, -48.5) and (-13.5, -46.5) waiting for source items.\n\n### Storage Facility\n- Wooden Chest at position (0.5, 0.5) currently empty.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Extracting Items\n- Ensure you are close enough to the target entity before attempting to extract items. This will prevent \"Manual extraction failed: Could not extract\" errors.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Check the supply chain to ensure that the inserters have access to source items. This will prevent inserters from waiting indefinitely for items.\n\n### Full Storage Warnings\n- Regularly check and empty chests to prevent them from becoming full, which can block production processes.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined by the agent in the provided logs.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the current inventory of items such as 'wooden-chest', 'wood', 'coal', 'iron-ore', and 'iron-plate'."}
