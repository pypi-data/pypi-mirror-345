{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 19.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (-5.5, 19.5)\n- Boiler at position (-2.5, 24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe Group connecting steam engine and boiler with positions including (-4.5, 16.5), (-5.5, 16.5), (-2.5, 17.5), etc.\n- Pipe Group connecting offshore pump and boiler with positions including (-9.5, 23.5), (-8.5, 23.5), (-7.5, 23.5), etc.\n- Electricity Group with Small Electric Poles at positions (-7.5, 22.5), (-6.5, 22.5), and (-1.5, 20.5)\n\n### Iron Plate Production at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting entities\n- Ensure you have the required items in inventory before attempting to connect entities. For instance, connecting pipes requires having pipes in inventory.\n- Verify that the entities you are trying to connect are compatible and correctly positioned.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient inventory items\n- Always check your inventory for necessary items before performing actions such as placing or connecting entities. For example, ensure you have enough Small Electric Poles before attempting to place them.\n\n### Errors when inserting items into entities\n- Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities like boilers or furnaces.\n\n### Errors due to entity status issues\n- Regularly check the status of entities to ensure they are operational. For example, ensure that the boiler has fuel and that the steam engine is connected and working.\n\n### Errors due to lack of power\n- Make sure that all electricity-dependent entities are connected to a power source and that there is a sufficient power supply."}
