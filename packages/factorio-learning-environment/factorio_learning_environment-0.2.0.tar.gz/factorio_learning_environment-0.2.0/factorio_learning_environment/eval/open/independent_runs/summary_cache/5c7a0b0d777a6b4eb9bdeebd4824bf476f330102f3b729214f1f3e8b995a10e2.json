{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Network\n- **Electricity Network**: Expanded from the lab at position (5.5, 5.5) to the power source at position (10.5, 34.5). Consists of multiple electric poles at various positions such as (13.5, 27.5), (7.5, 17.5), (9.5, 23.5), and others.\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage\n- **Coal Mining Operation**: \n  - Burner Mining Drill at position (40.0, -84.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (40.5, -82.5) and another at position (41.5, -83.5).\n  - Wooden Chests at positions (40.5, -82.5) and (41.5, -83.5) for coal storage.\n\n### Iron Plate Production\n- **Iron Plate Production Facility**:\n  - Burner Inserter at position (54.5, -83.5) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (56.5, -83.5) storing iron plates.\n\n### Copper Plate Production\n- **Copper Plate Production Facility**:\n  - Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -49.0) with a warning of no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Steam Power Generation\n- **Steam Power Plant**:\n  - Offshore Pump at position (-3.5, 27.5).\n  - Boiler at position (0.5, 28.0) with a warning of being out of fuel.\n  - Steam Engine at position (10.5, 34.5) with warnings of no input liquid and no fluid present in connections.\n  - Pipe Groups connecting various components, with one group at position (-3.5, 26.5) and another at position (1.5, 26.5).\n\n### Belt and Inserter System\n- **Transport Belt System**:\n  - BeltGroup with inputs and outputs at positions such as (50.5, -86.5) and (48.5, -86.5), transporting coal.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting boiler to steam engine\n- Ensure that pipes are correctly connected between the boiler and the steam engine. Verify that there are no missing or misaligned pipes preventing the connection.\n\n### Errors with fuel management\n- Regularly check and refuel boilers and mining drills to prevent interruptions in production due to lack of fuel.\n\n### Errors with ingredient supply\n- Ensure that all furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt to avoid production halts. Regularly supply required ores to maintain continuous operation.\n\n### Errors with power connections\n- Verify that all electric poles are correctly connected and that there are no gaps in the electricity network to ensure consistent power supply to all structures."}
