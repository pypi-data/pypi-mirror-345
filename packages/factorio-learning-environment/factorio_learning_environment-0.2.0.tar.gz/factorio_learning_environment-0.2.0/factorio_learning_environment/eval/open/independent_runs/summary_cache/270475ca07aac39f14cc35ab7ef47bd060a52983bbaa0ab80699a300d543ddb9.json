Every candidate coordinate was rejected (can_place_entity returned False), so no additional Steam Engine has been placed.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 API Misuse and Reference Validation:\n\u2003\u2013 When invoking functions such as pickup_entity, ensure that parameters are passed in the correct order (for example, passing None as the second parameter when needed) and that entity references are valid.\n\u2003\u2013 Avoid calling a Position object as if it were a function; for instance, use buildable_area.center (or its proper method) rather than invoking center() on a Position value.\n\n\u2022 Entity Placement Collision and Candidate Viability:\n\u2003\u2013 Always verify that the target placement coordinates are free from obstructions by using can_place_entity or an equivalent check before attempting to place an entity.\n\u2003\u2013 Repeated errors where candidate coordinates (determined via nearest_buildable or by offsetting from the Boiler\u2019s position) are rejected (can_place_entity returned False) indicate that the BuildingBox dimensions or environmental clearance parameters may be misaligned. Adjust dimensions and recheck clearance conditions.\n\n\u2022 Multiple Candidate Coordination:\n\u2003\u2013 When several candidate coordinates fail viability, reassess the surrounding obstructions and adjust placement search parameters (including offsets and BuildingBox dimensions) to identify an appropriate, unoccupied location.\n\n\u2022 Pipe Connection and Alignment:\n\u2003\u2013 Ensure that pipe endpoints on the Boiler and associated Steam Engines are properly aligned. Validate fluid box connections and clear any blockages if connection attempts fail.\n\n\u2022 Operational Consistency and Pre-Operational Checks:\n\u2003\u2013 Use standardized API calls and proper attribute access for consistent behavior.\n\u2003\u2013 Conduct comprehensive environment and inventory checks before repositioning or placement to avoid misplacement errors and repeated candidate failures."}
