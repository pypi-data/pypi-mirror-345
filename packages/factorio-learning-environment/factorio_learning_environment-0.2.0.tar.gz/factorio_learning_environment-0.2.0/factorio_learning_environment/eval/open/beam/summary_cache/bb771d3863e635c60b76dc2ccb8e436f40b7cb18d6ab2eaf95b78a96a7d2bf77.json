This ongoing issue indicates that a reset or restart of the environment is necessary to restore functionality.\n\nTo move forward, I recommend taking the following steps:\n\n1. **Reset the Environment**: Initiate a reset of the FactoryEnv to clear any existing states and restore interactivity.\n2. **Check for Errors**: After the reset, monitor for any error messages or issues that may arise during the initialization process.\n3. **Test Basic Commands**: Once the environment is reset, execute simple commands to ensure that it is functioning correctly before proceeding with more complex tasks.\n\nI appreciate your patience throughout this process. Please let me know how you would like to proceed or if there are any specific instructions you would like me to follow.", "summary_range": "[1-148]"}
