Check the inventory for necessary resources.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity on a tile before attempting to place it. Check for existing entities that may block placement.\n\n### Errors related to power supply\n- Verify that all structures requiring power, such as labs and electric machines, are connected to a power source. If a structure is not functioning, check the power connections."}
