{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Transfer Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) extracting iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-14.5, y=-48.5) storing extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-15.5, y=-48.5) intended to transfer iron ore from the chest to the furnace. However, there are alignment issues with the pickup position.\n\n### Iron Smelting Setup\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates. Currently not receiving iron ore due to misalignment of the inserter.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Alignment\n- Ensure that the inserter's pickup position is correctly aligned with the chest. The pickup position should match the chest's position to enable successful item transfer.\n- Regularly check the inserter's setup to ensure that both pickup and drop positions are correctly aligned with the respective entities.\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities\n- Before placing an entity, verify that the target tile is unoccupied and suitable for placement. Adjust spacing, direction, or reference position if necessary to avoid collisions with existing entities.\n\n### Errors with Fuel Management\n- Ensure that there is sufficient fuel in the inventory before attempting to refuel entities like mining drills and inserters. Regularly check fuel levels to maintain continuous operation."}
