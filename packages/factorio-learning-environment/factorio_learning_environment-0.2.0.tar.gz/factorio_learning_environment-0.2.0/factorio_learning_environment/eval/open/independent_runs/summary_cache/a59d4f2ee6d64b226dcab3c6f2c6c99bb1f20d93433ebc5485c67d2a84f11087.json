{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at Position (-15.0, -50.0) with fuel inventory of coal and working status. It extracts iron ore and deposits it into adjacent chests.\n- **Wooden Chests** at Positions (-14.5, -48.5) and (-15.5, -48.5) used for storing extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at Position (-13.5, -48.5) with fuel inventory of coal, responsible for transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at Position (-12.0, -48.0) with fuel inventory of coal, actively smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Additional Stone Furnace** at Position (-10.0, -48.0) with fuel inventory of coal, currently not smelting due to lack of ingredients.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage Area\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Wooden Chests** at various positions, including (-6.5, -49.5), (-6.5, -48.5), (-7.5, -48.5), (-5.5, -48.5), (-4.5, -48.5), and (-3.5, -48.5), used for storing iron plates.\n\n### Ore and Plate Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Inserters** at various positions, including (-14.5, -47.5), (-11.5, -46.5), (-8.5, -47.5), and (-11.5, -45.5), responsible for transferring materials between chests and furnaces.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserter Drop Position Blockage\n- Ensure that the destination for inserters is not blocked before attempting to transfer items. Regularly check and clear any blockages to maintain smooth operation.\n\n### Errors in Extracting Items from Furnaces\n- Confirm that the furnace has available items to extract before attempting extraction. Ensure the correct quantity is specified and that the extraction method is properly implemented.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Verify that there are available items at the source for inserters to pick up. Keep source inventories stocked to prevent idle inserters.\n\n### Errors in Furnace Operations Due to Lack of Ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces have a continuous supply of ingredients to maintain operation. Regularly supply furnaces with necessary materials to avoid downtime."}
