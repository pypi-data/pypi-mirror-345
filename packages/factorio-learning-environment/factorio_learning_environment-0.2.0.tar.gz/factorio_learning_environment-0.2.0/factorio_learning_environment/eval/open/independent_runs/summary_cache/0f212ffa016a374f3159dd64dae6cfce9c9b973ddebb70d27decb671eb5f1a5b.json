{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=5.5, y=21.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=5.5, y=21.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=-1.5, y=24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting the Offshore Pump to the Boiler\n- PipeGroup connecting the Boiler to the Steam Engine\n- ElectricityGroup with small electric poles at positions (x=1.5, y=14.5), (x=3.5, y=20.5), (x=1.5, y=6.5), (x=1.5, y=10.5), (x=1.5, y=2.5)\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with copper-plate production capability\n\n### Lab at Position (x=2.5, y=0.5)\n- Lab is connected to the electricity network and is currently conducting Automation research.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Insufficient Resources for Crafting\n- Ensure you have enough resources before attempting to craft items. For example, copper plates and copper cables are needed for crafting copper cables and small electric poles, respectively.\n\n### Errors When Using Extracting but Being Too Far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors When Placing into a Tile Which is Occupied by Another Entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing.\n\n### NameError in Code\n- Verify that all variables and function names are correctly defined and spelled. For example, ensure 'Lab' is defined before using it in your code.\n\n### Connection Issues with Pipes and Electric Poles\n- Ensure that all necessary items are in your inventory before attempting to connect entities. For example, connecting pipes and electric poles requires the respective items to be available.\n\n### Assertion Errors for Steam Engine\n- Ensure that the steam engine is properly connected and has sufficient resources to function. Regularly check its status to confirm it is working as expected.\n\n### Lab Entity Errors\n- Make sure that the Lab entity is correctly placed and recognized in the game environment to avoid errors related to lab operations.\n\n### Fuel Management\n- Regularly check your coal inventory to ensure you have enough to refuel boilers and other fuel-dependent entities."}
