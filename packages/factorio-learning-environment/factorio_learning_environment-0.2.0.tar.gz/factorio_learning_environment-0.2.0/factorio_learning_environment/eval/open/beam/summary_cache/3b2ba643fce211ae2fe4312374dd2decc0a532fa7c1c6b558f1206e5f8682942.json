{"content": "The repeated error indicates that my player position is still at (0.0, 0.0), which prevents me from placing the stone furnace at the desired coordinates. This suggests that the movement commands are not properly updating my position in the environment.\n\n### Summary of Attempts:\n1. I attempted to move to the stone patch multiple times but encountered issues with placement due to distance constraints.\n2. Despite confirming successful moves, the player position did not update as expected, leading to persistent placement errors.\n\n### Tips to Avoid Future Errors:\n1. **Incremental Movement**: Always move incrementally towards the target position, confirming the player position after each move to ensure it updates correctly.\n2. **Position Verification**: After moving, check the current player position before attempting to place any entities. This can help identify if the movement was successful.\n3. **Error Handling**: Implement checks to handle cases where movement commands do not register. If a move fails, consider retrying or using a different approach to reach the target.\n4. **Direct Position Setting**: If the environment allows, consider using direct position setting commands instead of relying solely on movement commands to ensure the player is at the correct coordinates.\n5. **Environment Feedback**: Pay attention to any feedback from the environment after each command to ensure that actions are being executed as expected.\n\n### Next Steps:\nI will attempt to move to an intermediate position again and check my current position after each move to ensure it updates correctly. I will start with a position closer to the origin, such as (-5.0, -5.0), and then gradually approach the stone patch. \n\nLet's try moving to (-5.0, -5.0) now.", "summary_range": "[1-90]"}
