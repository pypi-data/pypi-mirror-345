Regularly check its fuel status and refuel as necessary.\n- If a burner mining drill is not working, verify that it is not out of fuel.\n\n### Errors with Inserters\n- Inserters may wait for space in the destination or source items. Ensure that the destination has space available and that the source has items to transfer.\n- If an inserter is waiting for source items, check the inventory of the source entity to ensure it has the required items.\n\n### Errors with Stone Furnace\n- The stone furnace may report NO_INGREDIENTS. Ensure that it has the necessary ingredients to operate. Check the inventory and supply the required materials.\n\n### General Placement Errors\n- Ensure that entities are placed in valid positions and are not obstructed by other entities. Double-check the placement area before deploying new structures.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- **RefuelDrill(drill_position: Tuple[float, float], fuel_type: str) -> None**: Successfully refueled the burner mining drill at position (42.0, -83.0) multiple times.\n- **CheckFurnaceStatus(furnace_position: Tuple[float, float]) -> str**: Successfully checked the status of the stone furnace at position (0.0, 0.0).\n\n### Important Variables\n- `burner_mining_drill_position: Tuple[float, float]` - Position of the burner mining drill.\n- `stone_furnace_position: Tuple[float, float]` - Position of the stone furnace.\n- `wooden_chest_position: Tuple[float, float]` - Position of the wooden chest.\n- `current_inventory: Dict[str, int]` - Current inventory of the agent."}
