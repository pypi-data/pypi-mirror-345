In this interaction the agent inserted 10 iron ore and 10 coal into the furnace and subsequently extracted 30 iron plates.\n\n### Copper Smelting Furnace at Position(x=-27.0, y=-60.0)\nUsed for processing copper ore and coal into copper plates. Here the agent inserted 50 copper ore along with 10 coal into the furnace and later extracted 45 copper plates.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 API Misuse \u2013 When retrieving entities the calls to get_entities were made with incorrect parameters. In one instance an unexpected keyword argument (\u201cradius\u201d) was provided and later positional arguments were supplied when none were expected. Use the proper function signature to avoid these errors.\n  \n\u2022 Lab Placement and Retrieval \u2013 Multiple errors occurred while attempting to operate with Lab entities. The agent tried to place a Lab at Position(0.5, 2.5) without having one in inventory and subsequently encountered iteration errors when filtering a None value. Verify inventory availability and ensure that retrieved results are valid (i.e. not None) before processing them.\n  \n\u2022 Lab Crafting Resource Shortages \u2013 Attempts at crafting a Lab repeatedly failed due to missing sub-ingredients (for example, deficiencies in iron-gear-wheel components and electronic circuit requirements stemming from a lack of iron-plates and copper-plates/cables). Check that all necessary raw and intermediary materials are available prior to initiating Lab crafting actions."}
