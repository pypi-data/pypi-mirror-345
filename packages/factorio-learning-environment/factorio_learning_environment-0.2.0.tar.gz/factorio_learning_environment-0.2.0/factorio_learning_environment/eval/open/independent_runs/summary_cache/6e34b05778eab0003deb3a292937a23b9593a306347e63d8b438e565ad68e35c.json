Misplacement will result in resources not being collected.\n\n### Errors with Resource Availability\n- Verify that there is a sufficient supply of resources in the chests before attempting extraction. If resources are not available, check the supply chain for any disruptions or misplacements.\n\n**NAMESPACE**\n\nNo utility functions or important variables were defined or invoked in the provided steps."}
