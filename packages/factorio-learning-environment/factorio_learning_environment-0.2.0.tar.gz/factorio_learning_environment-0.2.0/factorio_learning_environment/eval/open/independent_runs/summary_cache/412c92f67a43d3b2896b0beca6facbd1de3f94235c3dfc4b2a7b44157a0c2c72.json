{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace at position (x=-19.0, y=-73.0) with no ingredients to smelt, containing copper plates.\n- Furnace at position (x=9.0, y=-64.0) with no ingredients to smelt, containing iron plates.\n- Furnace at position (x=6.0, y=-62.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Storage and Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest at position (x=7.5, y=-61.5) with an empty inventory.\n- Inserter at position (x=6.5, y=-60.5) not receiving electricity, connected to a small electric pole and a wooden chest.\n- Wooden chest at position (x=6.5, y=-59.5) containing iron plates.\n\n### Research Lab\n- Lab with input of automation science packs, currently not receiving power.\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=-5.5, y=24.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Offshore pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5) working and connected to a pipe.\n- Boiler at position (x=-5.5, y=24.0) with full output, connected to pipes and a steam engine.\n- Steam engine at position (x=-1.5, y=24.5) not generating power, connected to small electric poles.\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- PipeGroup at position (x=-8.5, y=23.5) with water, status full output.\n- PipeGroup at position (x=1.5, y=22.5), status empty.\n- PipeGroup at position (x=-4.5, y=26.5), status empty.\n\n### Electricity Networks\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at various positions, voltage 0.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Connecting Boiler to Steam Engine\n- Ensure there are no placement blockages when connecting pipes between the boiler and steam engine. Clear any obstruction before attempting to connect.\n\n### Steam Engine Not Generating Power\n- Verify that the steam engine is properly connected to the power network and receiving steam. Check fluid connections and ensure there is sufficient input liquid.\n\n### Inserter Not Receiving Electricity\n- Make sure the inserter is connected to a powered electricity network. Check connections and ensure the power network is active.\n\n### Lab Not Receiving Power\n- Ensure that the lab is connected to an active power source. Check the electricity network for any disconnections or power failures."}
