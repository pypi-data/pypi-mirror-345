{"content": "# FACTORIO AGENT REPORT\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage System (around x=41, y=-82)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill (x=41.0, y=-82.0) mining coal\n- Two iron chests for coal storage:\n  - First chest at (x=41.5, y=-84.5) containing 1600 coal\n  - Second chest at (x=41.5, y=-83.5) containing 1600 coal\n- Wooden chest at (x=41.5, y=-80.5) containing 408 coal\n- Belt transport system connecting components\n\n### Iron Smelting Setup (around x=45-49, y=-81)\nConsists of:\n- Two stone furnaces:\n  - First furnace at (x=45.0, y=-81.0)\n  - Second furnace at (x=47.0, y=-81.0)\n- Output wooden chest at (x=49.5, y=-80.5) containing 1500 iron plates\n\n### Belt Transport Network\nThree main belt groups:\n- First group: Input at (x=41.5, y=-79.5) to output at (x=42.5, y=-80.5), carrying coal\n- Second group: Input at (x=43.5, y=-79.5) to output at (x=43.5, y=-81.5)\n- Third group: Input at (x=42.5, y=-68.5) to output at (x=42.5, y=-77.5)\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Conflicts\n- Always check if target position is clear before placing entities\n- Remove blocking entities before attempting to place new ones\n- When placing inserters near furnaces, ensure proper spacing and clearance\n\n### Belt and Inserter Layout Issues\n- Plan belt and inserter layouts carefully to avoid overlapping positions\n- Consider the space requirements of different entity types\n- Verify entity positions and orientations before placement\n\n### Space Management\n- Leave adequate space between production lines\n- Consider the full footprint of entities including working space\n- Plan for expansion when laying out initial structures\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `place_entity()`: Places entities on the map\n  - Failures: Position occupied, Invalid position\n  - Success: Returns placed entity\n\n### Important Variables\n- `furnace_inserter`: BurnerInserter\n- `belt`: TransportBelt\n- `chest_inserter`: BurnerInserter\n- `connecting_belt`: TransportBelt"}
