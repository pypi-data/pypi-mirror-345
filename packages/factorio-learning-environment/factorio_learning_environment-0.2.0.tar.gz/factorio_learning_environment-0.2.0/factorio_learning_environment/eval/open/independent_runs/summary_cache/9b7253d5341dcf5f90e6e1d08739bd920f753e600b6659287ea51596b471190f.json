You need to add an inserter that inputs items into Prototype.SteamEngine and use the inserter as the target entity.\u201d\n  \u2013 Tip: Before connecting transport belts, ensure that the target entity is an inserter (or another valid connector) rather than a steam engine.\n\n\u2022 Placement Range Error (Step 212)\n  \u2013 When attempting to place a wooden chest at (3.5,15.5), an error indicates that the target position is too far from the player\u2019s current position.\n  \u2013 Tip: Move closer to the intended target position to satisfy the maximum placement distance.\n\n\u2022 Undefined Variable Error (Step 212)\n  \u2013 An error shows \u201cNameError: name 'target_chest' is not defined\u201d suggesting mistaken or missing variable naming.\n  \u2013 Tip: Verify that all variable names are correctly defined and referenced before use.\n\n\u2022 Inventory Shortage Error (Step 213)\n  \u2013 An error occurs when placing a wooden chest due to none being available in the inventory.\n  \u2013 Tip: Confirm the inventory contains the required item or craft it before attempting placement."}
