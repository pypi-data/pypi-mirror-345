{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Iron Plate Production at position (52.0, -80.0)\nConsists of a Furnace (position (52.0, -80.0)) and a BurnerInserter (position (53.5, -78.5)) that inserts iron ore into the furnace. The furnace produces iron plates.\n\n### Iron Plate Production at position (62.0, -54.0)\nConsists of a Furnace (position (62.0, -54.0)) that is currently not producing due to lack of ingredients.\n\n### Coal Transportation at position (51.5, -84.5)\nConsists of a BeltGroup that transports coal from a source (position (51.5, -84.5)) to the BurnerInserter (position (53.5, -78.5)) and the Furnace (position (52.0, -80.0)).\n\n### Storage at position (52.5, -82.5)\nConsists of a Chest (position (52.5, -82.5)) that stores items.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n### Errors when using undefined functions\n- Ensure that the function is defined before using it, for example, the `extract_em` function should be defined before calling it.\n\n### Errors when furnace fuel source is full\n- Ensure that the furnace fuel source is not full before adding more fuel, for example, the furnace at position (62.0, -54.0) has a full fuel source.\n\n### Errors when chest is full\n- Ensure that the chest is not full before inserting items, for example, the BurnerInserter at position (53.5, -78.5) has a warning that the chest is full.\n\n### NAMESPACE\n* `extract_em`: Not defined, caused an error when called.\n* `itPrototype.IronPlate`: Used as an argument in the `extract_em` function.\n* `furnace`: Used as an argument in the `extract_em` function.\n* `quantity`: Used as an argument in the `extract_em` function, set to 10.\n* Important variables:\n  + `transport-belt`: 150\n  + `burner-inserter`: 9\n  + `burner-mining-drill`: 1\n  + `wood`: 2\n  + `coal`: 917\n  + `stone`: 5\n  + `iron-ore`: 186\n  + `iron-plate`: 2927"}
