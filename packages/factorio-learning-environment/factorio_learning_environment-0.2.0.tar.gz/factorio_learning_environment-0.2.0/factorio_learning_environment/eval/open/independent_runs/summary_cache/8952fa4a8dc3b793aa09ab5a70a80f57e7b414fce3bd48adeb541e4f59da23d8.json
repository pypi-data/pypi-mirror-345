{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) fueled by coal, used for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (1.5, 0.5) waiting for source items, intended to transfer items from the furnace to a wooden chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (2.5, 0.5) used for storing iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (3.5, 0.5) waiting for source items, intended to transfer items from the wooden chest to a transport belt.\n- Transport Belt at position (4.5, 0.5) functioning properly, used to move items along the production line.\n- Burner Inserter at position (6.5, 0.5) waiting for source items, intended to transfer items from the transport belt to another wooden chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (7.5, 0.5) containing iron ore and iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (8.5, 0.5) working, transferring items from the wooden chest to the copper furnace.\n- BeltGroup connecting positions (3.5, 0.5) to (5.5, 0.5) and (4.5, 0.5) to (6.5, 0.5).\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (10.0, 0.0) fueled by coal, used for smelting copper ore into copper plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (11.5, 0.5) working, transferring items from the copper furnace to a wooden chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (12.5, 0.5) used for storing copper plates.\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) fueled by coal, extracting coal and dropping it into a wooden chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (40.5, -83.5) storing extracted coal.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserters and Missing Source Entities\n- Ensure that the source entity is present and contains items before placing or activating an inserter. This will prevent the inserter from waiting indefinitely for source items.\n\n### Errors with Transport Belts and Extraction\n- Verify that the transport belt contains the intended items before attempting to extract from it. This will avoid errors related to missing items on the belt.\n\n### Errors when Placing Entities on Occupied Tiles\n- Check the target tile for existing entities before placing a new entity. Adjust the spacing, direction, or reference position to avoid conflicts with existing structures.\n\n### Errors with Fuel Management\n- Regularly refuel entities like furnaces and mining drills to maintain continuous operation and avoid interruptions in production.\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the source entity is adequately supplied with items to prevent inserters from idling due to a lack of source items."}
