{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Setup at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nThis setup is designed to extract and process iron ore. It consists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and deposits it into the adjacent chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the stone furnace.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates, but currently not receiving ore due to setup issues.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities too far from the player\n- Ensure the player is within the maximum allowable distance (10 tiles) from the target position before attempting to place an entity. Move closer to the target position to avoid placement errors.\n\n### Errors when placing entities in occupied or unsuitable tiles\n- Before placing an entity, verify that the target tile is unoccupied and suitable for placement. Consider adjusting the spacing, changing the direction, or selecting a different reference position to avoid collisions with existing entities or unsuitable terrain.\n\n### Inserter alignment and functionality issues\n- Check the alignment and setup of inserters to ensure they are correctly positioned to transfer items between entities. Misalignment can prevent the inserter from functioning properly, leading to bottlenecks in resource processing.\n\n### Fuel management for entities\n- Regularly refuel entities such as mining drills, inserters, and furnaces to maintain continuous operation. Monitor fuel levels to prevent interruptions in resource extraction and processing.\n\n### Chest capacity and resource overflow\n- Monitor the capacity of storage chests to prevent overflow. Ensure chests are emptied or have sufficient space to accommodate incoming resources from mining drills."}
