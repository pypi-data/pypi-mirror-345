{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility at Position (53.0, -83.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (53.0, -83.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (52.5, -84.5) storing coal.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-20.0, -70.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-20.0, -70.0) and a Stone Furnace at position (-18.0, -70.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Copper Ore Mining and Storage Facility at Position (-23.0, -68.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-23.0, -68.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-23.5, -69.5) storing copper ore.\n- Transport Belt network connecting the mining drill to the chest.\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Storage Facility at Position (-14.0, -53.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-14.0, -53.0) connected to a Wooden Chest at position (-12.5, -54.5) storing iron ore.\n- Transport Belt network facilitating the movement of iron ore from the mining drill to the chest.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (0.0, 0.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Wooden Chest at position (1.5, 0.5) storing coal, iron ore, and iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (2.5, 0.5) waiting for source items.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Reconnecting Transport Belts\n- Ensure that the transport belts are correctly aligned and connected. Check for any missing or misaligned belts that might cause connection failures.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Verify the alignment of inserters and ensure that the source supply is available. Check if the inserters are correctly positioned to pick up items from the source.\n\n### No Ingredients to Smelt in Furnaces\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to smelt. Check the supply chain to make sure raw materials are being delivered to the furnaces.\n\n### Errors when Using Extracting but Being Too Far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when Placing into a Tile which is Occupied by Another Entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placing."}
