{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Setup\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0)\n  - Extracts iron ore from the resource patch.\n  - Connected to a **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5) for storing mined iron ore.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5)\n  - Stores iron ore extracted by the mining drill.\n  - Connected to a **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5) for transferring iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5)\n  - Transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the **Stone Furnace**.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-12.0, -48.0)\n  - Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates, but currently not receiving iron ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Misalignment and Fuel Issues\n- Ensure that inserters are properly aligned and fueled to transfer resources between entities. Regularly check and refuel inserters to maintain operation.\n- Verify that the inserter's pickup and drop positions are correctly set to facilitate the transfer of materials.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Ingredients\n- Check the setup of inserters to ensure they are correctly transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n- Ensure that the furnace has the necessary ingredients to smelt. If the furnace is not receiving iron ore, recheck the inserter alignment and functionality.\n\n### Inventory Management\n- Regularly monitor and manage the inventory of the wooden chest to prevent it from becoming full, which can halt mining operations.\n- Extract excess iron ore from the chest to maintain space for continuous mining.\n\n### Fuel Management for Mining Drill\n- Ensure a steady supply of coal to refuel the mining drill to avoid interruptions in mining operations.\n- Regularly check coal inventory and harvest additional coal as needed to maintain fuel levels."}
