{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-47.5, -123.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (-47.5, -123.5) with warnings of 'no fluid present in connections' and status 'NOT_CONNECTED'.\n- Boiler at Position (-46.5, -121.0) with warnings of 'no input liquid', 'no fluid present in connections', and status 'NOT_CONNECTED'.\n- Steam Engine at Position (-41.5, -117.5) with warnings of 'not connected to power network', 'no input liquid', 'no fluid present in connections', and status 'NOT_CONNECTED'.\n- Small Electric Pole at Position (-39.5, -116.5) connected to the steam engine.\n\n### Copper Plate Production Facility\n- Stone Furnace at Position (-19.0, -73.0) with status 'NO_INGREDIENTS' and producing 'copper-plate'.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\n- Stone Furnace at Position (9.0, -64.0) with status 'NO_INGREDIENTS' and producing 'iron-plate'.\n- Stone Furnace at Position (6.0, -62.0) with status 'NO_INGREDIENTS'.\n\n### Storage and Transfer System\n- Wooden Chest at Position (7.5, -61.5) with empty inventory.\n- Inserter at Position (6.5, -60.5) with status 'NO_POWER', connected to the small electric pole and stone furnace.\n- Wooden Chest at Position (6.5, -59.5) containing 'iron-plate'.\n\n### Research Facility\n- Lab with input of 'automation-science-pack' and status 'NO_POWER'.\n\n### Pipe Network\n- Multiple Pipe Groups at various positions, all with status 'EMPTY', indicating no fluid flow.\n\n### Electricity Network\n- Electricity Group with multiple small electric poles, voltage at 0, indicating no power distribution.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Pipe Connections\n- Ensure pipes are correctly placed and connected to the intended entities. Verify the positions of pipes and ensure they align with the connection points of the offshore pump and boiler.\n\n### Boiler Connection Issues\n- Connect the boiler to a water source and ensure it is properly connected to the steam engine. Check the alignment and connectivity of pipes to resolve the 'NOT_CONNECTED' status.\n\n### Inserter Power Supply\n- Ensure that inserters are connected to a powered electric pole. Verify the electricity network to ensure power is being distributed to all connected entities.\n\n### Lab Power Supply\n- Connect the lab to a power source to resolve the 'NO_POWER' status. Check the electricity network for any disconnections or lack of power generation.\n\n### General Placement Errors\n- Before placing entities, ensure the target tile is unoccupied and suitable for the entity type. This will prevent errors related to entity placement on occupied tiles."}
