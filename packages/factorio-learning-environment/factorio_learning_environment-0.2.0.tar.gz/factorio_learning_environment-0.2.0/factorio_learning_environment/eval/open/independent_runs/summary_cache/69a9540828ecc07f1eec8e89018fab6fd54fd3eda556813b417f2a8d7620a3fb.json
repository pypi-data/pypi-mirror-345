The chest at position (4.5, -58.5) is currently full, which stops the mining drill from continuing its operation.\n\n### Furnace Operation\n- Regularly supply furnaces with necessary ingredients to maintain continuous production. The furnaces at positions (-13.0, -48.0) and (-11.0, -48.0) are not operational due to a lack of ingredients.\n- Monitor furnace fuel levels to avoid overfilling, as indicated by the warning on the furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0).\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions**: None defined in the current logs.\n- **Important Variables**:\n  - `inventory`: Dict[str, int] - Tracks the player's inventory, including items like 'wooden-chest', 'iron-plate', and 'iron-gear-wheel'.
