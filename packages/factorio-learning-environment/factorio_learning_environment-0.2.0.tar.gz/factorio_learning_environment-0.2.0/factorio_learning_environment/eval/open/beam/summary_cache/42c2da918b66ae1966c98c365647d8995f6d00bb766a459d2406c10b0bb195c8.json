{"content": "\"\"\"\nAfter extracting the remaining Copper Ore from the active furnace, here are the updated results:\n\n### Active Furnace Output Status:\n- The active furnace now contains only **18 Iron Plates**, having successfully removed the Copper Ore. It remains in a **\"WORKING\"** status.\n\n### Overall Inventory Overview:\n- **Current Inventory**:\n  - 4 pieces of stone furnaces\n  - 7 pieces of coal remaining\n  - 5 pieces of iron ore\n  - **2 pieces of copper ore** remaining in the inventory.\n  - **3 pieces of iron plates**.\n\n### Observations:\n- The furnace is functional but is not processing any Copper Ore, which is a recurring issue.\n- The inventory shows **2 pieces of Copper Ore**, which is insufficient for smelting operations, as it typically requires at least **2 pieces** to initiate processing.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Load Copper Ore into the Furnace**: Attempt to load the **2 pieces of Copper Ore** into the furnace to see if it can process them this time.\n2. **Monitor for Smelting Activity**: Observe if the furnace engages in smelting after the Copper Ore is loaded.\n\nLet\u2019s proceed by inserting the **2 pieces of Copper Ore** back into the active furnace for processing. \n\"\"\"\n\n# Load the Copper Ore into the active furnace for smelting\ninsert_item(Prototype.CopperOre, active_furnace, quantity=2)  # Insert 2 pieces of Copper Ore into the active furnace\n\n# Check the inventory status of the furnace after loading\nactive_furnace_inventory_status_after_loading = inspect_inventory(active_furnace)  # Inspect the status of the furnace post-loading\noverall_inventory_after_loading = inspect_inventory()  # Check total inventory after loading.\n\nprint(f\"Active Furnace inventory status after loading Copper Ore: {active_furnace_inventory_status_after_loading}\")  # Status of the furnace after loading.\nprint(f\"Overall current inventory after loading copper: {overall_inventory_after_loading}\")  # Total inventory after all operations. \nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")  # Review entities displayed on the map.", "summary_range": "[1-300]"}
