{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Smelting Facility at Position (-10.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-10.0, -50.0)\n\nThis facility is used for smelting iron ore into iron plates. The stone furnace has been refueled multiple times with coal, but it frequently runs out of fuel and iron ore, as indicated by its warnings and status.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors due to Insufficient Inventory for Placement\n- Ensure that the required item is available in the inventory before attempting to place an entity. For example, the attempt to place a stone furnace failed initially because there was no stone furnace in the inventory.\n\n### Errors due to Insufficient Ingredients for Crafting\n- Verify that all necessary ingredients are available before crafting. The agent could not craft a stone furnace initially due to a lack of stone.\n\n### Errors when Extracting Items\n- Ensure that the target entity contains the item you wish to extract before attempting extraction. The agent encountered an error when trying to extract iron plates from the furnace because the furnace did not contain any iron plates at that time.\n\n### Errors when Inserting Items without Inventory\n- Confirm that the items you wish to insert are present in your inventory before attempting to insert them into an entity. The agent faced an error when trying to insert iron ore into the furnace without having iron ore in the inventory."}
