{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Collection and Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (42.0, -83.0) with the status of NO_FUEL, warnings include \"out of fuel\" and \"output blocked by item on the ground. There is no sink entity in place to accept the output.\"\n- Burner Inserter at position (42.5, -81.5) with the status of WAITING_FOR_SOURCE_ITEMS, fueled with coal, and responsible for transferring coal from the mining drill to a Wooden Chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (43.5, -80.5) to collect coal transferred by the Burner Inserter.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -49.0) with the status of FULL_OUTPUT, fueled with coal, and processing iron ore into iron plates. The furnace source contains iron ore, and the result is iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities at occupied positions\n- Ensure that the intended position for placing an entity is clear of any existing objects. If an error occurs stating that the position is occupied, try repositioning the entity to a nearby clear tile.\n\n### Errors with entity dimensions and placement\n- Verify the dimensions of entities before attempting to place them. Ensure that the placement logic accounts for the entity's width and height, and that the target position can accommodate these dimensions.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors with type conversion in code\n- When using type conversion functions such as `int()`, ensure that the argument passed is a valid string, bytes-like object, or real number. Avoid passing non-convertible types like 'ModelPrivateAttr'.\n\n### Errors with callable objects\n- Avoid treating non-callable objects as functions. Ensure that the code correctly references attributes and methods, and does not mistakenly attempt to call non-callable objects."}
