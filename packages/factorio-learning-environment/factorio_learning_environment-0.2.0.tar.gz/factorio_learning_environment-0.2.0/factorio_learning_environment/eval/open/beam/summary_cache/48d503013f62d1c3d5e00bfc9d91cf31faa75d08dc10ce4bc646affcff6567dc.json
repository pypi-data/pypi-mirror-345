{"content": "Ah, I see the issue. We need to check if the item name matches exactly with what's in the inventory. Let's debug this:\n\n```python\n# First, let's check our inventory and print exact keys\ncurrent_inventory = inspect_inventory()\nprint(f\"Current inventory: {current_inventory}\")\nprint(f\"Inventory keys: {list(current_inventory.keys())}\")\n\n# Get the recipe for stone furnace to see exact name\nrecipe = get_prototype_recipe(Prototype.StoneFurnace)\nprint(f\"Stone furnace recipe: {recipe}\")\n\n# Craft the stone furnace\ncraft_item(Prototype.StoneFurnace)\nprint(\"Attempted to craft stone furnace\")\n\n# Check updated inventory\nnew_inventory = inspect_inventory()\nprint(f\"Updated inventory: {new_inventory}\")\n\n# Now try to place the furnace\nmove_to(Position(x=-10.0, y=29.0))\nfurnace = place_entity(\n    Prototype.StoneFurnace,\n    position=Position(x=-10.0, y=29.0),\n    direction=Direction.UP,\n    exact=True\n)\n\nif furnace:\n    # Add fuel to furnace\n    insert_item(Prototype.Coal, furnace, quantity=5)\n    print(f\"Successfully placed and fueled furnace at {furnace.position}\")\n\n    # Place inserter\n    move_to(Position(x=-10.5, y=28.5))\n    inserter = place_entity(\n        Prototype.BurnerInserter,\n        position=Position(x=-10.5, y=28.5),\n        direction=Direction.RIGHT,\n        exact=True\n    )\n    \n    if inserter:\n        insert_item(Prototype.Coal, inserter, quantity=5)\n        print(f\"Successfully placed and fueled inserter at {inserter.position}\")\n\nprint(f\"Final entities: {get_entities()}\")\n```\n\nThis should help us understand exactly what's in our inventory and why the stone furnace isn't being recognized correctly. We'll see the exact inventory keys and make sure we're using the correct item names.", "summary_range": "[1-560]"}
