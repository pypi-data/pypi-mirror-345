{"content": "Ah, I see the issue. We don't have a burner mining drill in our inventory.

Use our existing stone furnace to smelt iron ore\n2. Extract the iron plates\n3. Attempt to craft an iron chest with the plates\n4. Keep us informed of the inventory status throughout the process\n\nLet me know if you see any other issues or if there's something specific you'd like me to focus on!", "summary_range": "[1-160]"}
