{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at position (6.0, -62.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (6.0, -62.0) fueled with coal and processing iron ore.\n- Wooden Chest at position (7.5, -61.5) for storage.\n- Inserter at position (6.5, -60.5) waiting for source items, connected to a small electric pole network.\n- Wooden Chest at position (6.5, -59.5) containing iron plates and copper plates.\n\n### Electricity Generator at position (-5.5, 24.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Boiler at position (-5.5, 24.0) fueled with coal, connected to a series of pipes and a steam engine.\n- Steam Engine at position (-1.5, 24.5) generating electricity, connected to small electric poles.\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5) supplying water to the boiler.\n- PipeGroup facilitating steam and water transport between the boiler, steam engine, and offshore pump.\n\n### Research Lab\n- Lab with no research in progress, connected to the electricity network.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when using inserters without electricity\n- Ensure that inserters are placed near an active electricity group or power source to function correctly. Verify the connection to the electricity network before placing or using inserters.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting placement to avoid conflicts with existing structures."}
