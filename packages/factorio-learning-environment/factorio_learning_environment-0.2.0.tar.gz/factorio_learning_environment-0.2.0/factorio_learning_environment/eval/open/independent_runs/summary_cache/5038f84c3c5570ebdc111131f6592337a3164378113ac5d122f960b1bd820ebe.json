{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\nCurrently, there are no structures built on the map. The logs indicate attempts to place various entities, but none have been successfully placed. The map remains empty of structures.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when attempting to place entities on non-buildable tiles\n- Ensure the target tile is buildable before attempting to place an entity. Check for any obstructions or environmental restrictions that might prevent placement.\n\n### Errors due to lack of resources for operation\n- Make sure to supply necessary resources, like coal for furnaces, to ensure they can operate once placed.\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Verify that the tile is unoccupied and suitable for the entity you wish to place. Avoid attempting to place entities on tiles that already have structures or are otherwise restricted.\n\n### General placement errors\n- Double-check the coordinates and ensure that the position is within the buildable area of the map. Consider moving to the location to visually confirm the suitability for placement.\n\nThese tips should help in mitigating the errors encountered in the initial steps and facilitate successful construction of structures in future steps."}
