Several attempts were made to set up a Lab at (0.5, 2.5) for supplying Automation Science Packs to ongoing research, but every placement and crafting effort failed due to resource shortages and API misusage. Smelting operations were carried out using available furnaces\u2014one referenced at Position(5.0, 5.0) for iron plate production and another at Position(-27.0, -60.0) for copper plate production\u2014but these entities were retrieved from the environment rather than being newly constructed by the agent.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\u2500\n\u2022 API Usage Consistency \u2013 Avoid passing unexpected arguments to built-in functions. The get_entities call was first used with a keyword (radius) that is not supported and then with multiple positional arguments. Verify the expected function signature before invocation.\n  \n\u2022 Iteration on None Values \u2013 When calling functions like get_entities that might return None, ensure a proper check or use of a fallback (such as an empty list) before iterating over the result.\n  \n\u2022 Lab Placement Prerequisites \u2013 Prior to attempting to place a Lab at (0.5, 2.5), confirm that the Lab is available in the inventory. Placement errors occurred when trying to set an entity on a tile without the corresponding item.\n  \n\u2022 Lab Crafting Resource Shortages \u2013 Multiple lab crafting failures were due to missing sub-ingredients (such as iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, and copper-cables). Validate that all required materials and their precursors are available (or can be produced via smelting operations) before initiating a lab crafting routine."}
