{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) extracting iron ore. The drill is fueled with coal and is currently working.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (x=-14.0, y=-48.0) smelting iron ore into iron plates. The furnace is fueled with coal and has a full inventory of iron plates.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-14.5, y=-46.5) transferring iron ore from the mining drill to the furnace. This inserter is fueled with coal and is currently waiting for source items.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (x=-12.5, y=-47.5) transferring iron plates from the furnace to a wooden chest. This inserter is fueled with coal and is currently waiting for source items.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (x=-11.5, y=-47.5) storing iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities into occupied tiles\n- Ensure that the target tile for placing an entity is unoccupied. If an entity already exists at the intended position, consider adjusting the spacing, changing the direction, or selecting a different reference position.\n\n### Misalignment of inserters\n- Verify the alignment of inserters to ensure that the pickup and drop positions match the intended source and destination entities. Misalignment can prevent proper transfer of items. Adjust the inserter's position or direction as needed.\n\n### Inserter waiting for source items\n- If an inserter is waiting for source items, ensure that the source entity is producing or has items available for transfer. Check the source entity's status and inventory to resolve any issues."}
