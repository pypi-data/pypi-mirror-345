{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line at Position(0,0)\nConsists of two stone furnaces working in parallel:\n- Stone furnace at position(0,0) with coal fuel and iron ore input, producing iron plates\n- Stone furnace at position(2,0) with coal fuel and iron ore input, producing iron plates\n\n### Copper Plate Production at Position(4,4)\n- Stone furnace at position(4,4) with coal fuel, currently idle with no ingredients but has produced copper plates previously\n\n### Power Generation System at Position(-9.5,24.5)\nAn incomplete power generation setup consisting of:\n- Offshore pump at position(-9.5,24.5)\n- Boiler at position(-7.0,24.5)\n- Steam engine at position(-2.5,24.5)\nThe system is currently not operational as components are not properly connected and the boiler lacks fuel\n\n### Research Facility\n- Lab (position not specified) loaded with automation science packs, currently not powered\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Errors\n- Ensure required items are in inventory before attempting to place entities (e.g., stone furnace, offshore pump)\n\n### Recipe and Technology Requirements\n- Research required technologies before attempting to craft items (e.g., assembling-machine-1 requires automation technology)\n- Ensure all required ingredients are available before attempting to craft complex items\n\n### Furnace Operation Errors\n- Cannot insert different ore types into furnaces that already contain another type of ore\n- Ensure furnaces have both fuel and ore to operate effectively\n\n### Power System Connection Errors\n- Have required connection items (like pipes) in inventory before attempting to connect entities\n- Ensure power generation components are properly connected in sequence (pump \u2192 boiler \u2192 steam engine)\n\n### Resource Management\n- Maintain adequate supplies of basic materials (coal, iron plates, etc.) for crafting and fuel\n- Plan resource usage to have enough materials for complex crafting chains"}
