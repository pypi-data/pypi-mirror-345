{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 19.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Steam Engine at position (-5.5, 19.5) - Status: NOT_CONNECTED\n- Boiler at position (-2.5, 24.0) - Status: NO_FUEL\n- Offshore Pump at position (-9.5, 24.5) - Status: WORKING\n- Pipe Group at position (-5.5, 16.5) - Status: EMPTY\n- Pipe Group at position (-8.5, 23.5) - Status: FULL_OUTPUT\n- Electricity Group at position (-5.4, 20.0) - Status: NOT_PLUGGED_IN_ELECTRIC_NETWORK\n\n### Stone Furnace at Position (0.0, 0.0)\n- Status: NO_INGREDIENTS\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities without inventory\n- Ensure you have the required entities in your inventory before attempting to place them. For example, attempting to place a Small Electric Pole without having it in inventory resulted in failure.\n\n### Errors due to disconnected electricity network\n- Make sure to connect all components of the electricity network, including the steam engine, boiler, and electricity group, to ensure they are all plugged in and functioning.\n\n### Errors due to lack of fuel\n- Keep track of fuel levels in entities like boilers to prevent them from running out of fuel, which can halt production.\n\n### Errors due to missing ingredients\n- Ensure that all required ingredients are available for entities like stone furnaces to function correctly.\n\n### IndexError in code execution\n- Avoid accessing list indices that may not exist. Ensure that lists are properly populated before accessing their elements to prevent 'IndexError: list index out of range'.\n\n### Errors when inserting items without inventory\n- Verify that you have the necessary items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities, as seen with the failed coal insertion attempt."}
