{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(-0.5, -9.5)\nConsists of steam engine (position -0.5, -9.5), boiler (position -4.5, 23.0), and offshore pump (position -7.5, 25.5). The steam engine is currently not connected to a power network, and the boiler has no input liquid.\n\n### Copper plate furnace at position(0, 0)\nConsists of a stone furnace (position 0, 0) that is currently not smelting any ingredients.\n\n### Copper plate furnace at position(5, 5)\nConsists of a stone furnace (position 5, 5) that is currently not smelting any ingredients.\n\n### Lab at position(0.5, -12.5)\nConsists of a lab (position 0.5, -12.5) that currently has no power.\n\n### Pipe groups\nConsists of multiple pipe groups located at various positions:\n- PipeGroup at position (-8.5, -6.5) with status EMPTY\n- PipeGroup at position (-11.5, -4.5) with status EMPTY\n- PipeGroup at position (-14.5, 23.5) with status EMPTY\n- PipeGroup at position (-6.5, 23.5) with status EMPTY\n- PipeGroup at position (-17.5, 25.5) with status EMPTY\n- PipeGroup at position (-20.5, 27.5) with status EMPTY\n- PipeGroup at position (-7.5, 24.5) with status FULL_OUTPUT\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when connecting boiler to steam engine\n- Ensure that pipes are correctly placed and connected between the boiler and steam engine. Check the positions of the pipes and ensure they are not obstructed.\n\n### Errors when trying to access a lab\n- Verify that the lab is present at the specified position before attempting to access it. If the lab is not found, check for its correct placement on the map.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it. Check for any existing entities in the targeted position."}
