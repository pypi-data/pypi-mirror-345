{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (-13.0, -48.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) connected to a wooden chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) and a stone furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0).\n- Wooden Chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) storing iron ore.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0) processing iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-14.5, -46.5) transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace.\n\n### Coal Production Facility at Position (43.0, -82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) connected to a wooden chest at position (41.5, -80.5) and a stone furnace at position (43.0, -82.0).\n- Wooden Chest at position (41.5, -80.5) storing coal.\n- Stone Furnace at position (43.0, -82.0) processing coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (43.5, -80.5) transferring coal from the chest to the furnace.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when inserting items without having them in inventory\n- Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity. For example, attempting to insert iron ore into a furnace without having iron ore in your inventory will result in an error.\n\n### Errors due to full chests preventing mining operations\n- Regularly check and empty chests at drop positions to prevent mining drills from halting operations due to full inventories. For instance, ensure the chest at (41.5, -80.5) and (-14.5, -48.5) are emptied to continue mining operations efficiently.\n\n### Errors when inserters are waiting for source items\n- Ensure that the source items are available for inserters to function. Check that the inserter at (-14.5, -46.5) has access to iron ore in the chest to transfer it to the furnace."}
