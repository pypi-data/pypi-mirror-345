{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (-15.0, -48.0), fueled with coal and currently working.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -48.0), fueled with coal but with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Stone Furnace at position (-11.0, -48.0), fueled with coal and currently working.\n\n### Iron Ore Storage and Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden Chest at position (-11.5, -50.5) with a full inventory of iron plates.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-10.5, -50.5) used for transferring iron plates.\n\n### Mining and Storage System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (4.0, -60.0), fueled with coal and working, with a warning about a full chest at drop position.\n- Wooden Chests at various positions (5.5, -60.5), (4.5, -58.5), etc., used for storing mined resources like iron ore and iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inventory Full Error\n- Ensure that there is enough space in the target inventory before attempting to insert items. Consider upgrading to larger storage solutions or managing inventory more efficiently.\n\n### Entity Retrieval Error\n- Verify the existence and position of entities before attempting to retrieve them. This can be done by maintaining an updated map of entity positions and types.\n\n### Warnings on Full Chests\n- Regularly monitor and empty chests that are used as drop points for mining drills to prevent interruptions in resource collection.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `insert_item`: Attempts to insert a specified quantity of an item into a target container. Failure occurs if the target inventory is full.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `empty_chest`: Represents a target chest for item insertion or retrieval operations.\n- `iron_ore_to_transfer`: Represents the quantity of iron ore intended for transfer operations."}
