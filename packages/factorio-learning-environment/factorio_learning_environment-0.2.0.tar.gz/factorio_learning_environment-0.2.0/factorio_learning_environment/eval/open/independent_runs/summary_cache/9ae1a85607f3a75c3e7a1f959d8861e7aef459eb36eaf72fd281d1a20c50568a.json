{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (17.5, 20.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Steam Engine** at position (17.5, 20.5), status: WORKING\n- **Boiler** at position (1.5, 23.0), status: WORKING, fueled with coal\n- **Offshore Pump** at position (-9.5, 24.5), status: WORKING\n\nThese entities are connected through a network of pipes and are responsible for generating electricity. The steam engine converts steam into electricity, which is produced by the boiler using water supplied by the offshore pump.\n\n### Pipe Networks\n- **Steam Pipe Network**: Connects the boiler and steam engine, facilitating the transfer of steam.\n- **Water Pipe Network**: Connects the offshore pump to the boiler, facilitating the transfer of water.\n\n### Electricity Network\n- **Electricity Poles**: Positioned at various coordinates to distribute electricity generated by the steam engine.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Insufficient Inventory\n- Ensure that you have the required items in your inventory before attempting to insert them into entities. For example, attempting to insert coal into the boiler failed due to a lack of coal in the inventory.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- **insert_item**: Attempts to insert a specified quantity of an item into a target entity. Ensure the item exists in the inventory to avoid errors.\n\n### Important Variables\n- **boiler**: Represents the boiler entity in the electricity generation structure.\n- **offshore_pump**: Represents the offshore pump entity in the electricity generation structure.\n- **steam_engine**: Represents the steam engine entity in the electricity generation structure.\n- **pipe**: Represents the pipe entities connecting various components in the electricity generation structure."}
