{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Setup at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nThis setup is designed to extract iron ore and process it into iron plates. It consists of the following entities:\n\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and deposits it into a nearby chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore from the mining drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-13.5, -48.5): Transfers iron ore from the wooden chest to the stone furnace. It requires coal as fuel.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates, but currently not receiving iron ore due to misalignment issues.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Misalignment of Inserter Pickup and Drop Positions\n- Ensure that the inserter's pickup position is correctly aligned with the chest and its drop position is aligned with the furnace. Reposition the inserter if necessary to ensure proper transfer of materials.\n\n### Inserter Running Out of Fuel\n- Regularly check and refuel the burner inserter with coal to maintain continuous operation. Consider setting up a more efficient coal supply chain to prevent frequent fuel shortages.\n\n### Furnace Not Receiving Iron Ore\n- Verify the setup of the inserter to ensure it is correctly transferring iron ore from the chest to the furnace. Check for any misalignments or blockages in the transfer path.\n\n### Low Coal Inventory\n- Monitor coal levels and mine additional coal as needed. Redistribute existing coal efficiently to maintain operations of all coal-dependent entities."}
