{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Automation Science Pack Production Line at position(8.5, 13.5)\nConsists of:\n- Assembling machine 1 at position(8.5, 13.5)\n- Iron gear inserter at position(8.5, 9.5)\n- Iron gear chest at position(8.5, 8.5)\n- Output inserter at position(10.5, 13.5)\n- Output chest at position(11.5, 13.5)\n- Transport belt system connecting components\n\n### Power Generation System\nConsists of:\n- Steam engine at position(-4.5, 12.5)\n- Boiler at position(-4.5, 16.0)\n- Offshore pump at position(-3.5, 27.5)\n- Multiple pipe groups connecting water flow\n- Electric pole network with poles at various positions including (-1.5,12.5), (0.5,14.5), (8.5,15.5)\n\n### Iron Mining and Smelting Operations\nMultiple setups consisting of:\n1. Setup at (-28.0, -61.0):\n   - Burner mining drill\n   - Wooden chest at (-27.5, -59.5)\n   - Burner inserter at (-26.5, -59.5)\n   - Stone furnace at (-25.0, -59.0)\n   - Output chest at (-22.5, -58.5)\n   - Output inserter at (-23.5, -58.5)\n\n2. Setup at (-18.0, -53.0):\n   - Burner mining drill\n   - Wooden chest at (-17.5, -51.5)\n   - Burner inserter at (-16.5, -51.5)\n   - Stone furnace at (-15.0, -51.0)\n   - Output chest at (-12.5, -50.5)\n   - Output inserter at (-13.5, -50.5)\n\n### Coal Mining Setup at (41.0, -82.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill\n- Output chest at (41.5, -80.5)\n- Burner inserter at (41.5, -79.5)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Entity Placement Collision Errors\n- Check for existing entities before placing new ones - common collisions with:\n  - Electric poles\n  - Transport belts\n  - Wooden chests\n  - Stone furnaces\n- Increase spacing or change direction when placing entities next to existing structures\n\n### Power and Fuel Issues\n- Ensure machines have proper fuel supply - multiple burner mining drills are out of fuel\n- Power network is not properly distributing electricity - steam engine not receiving power\n\n### Production Line Setup\n- When reorganizing production lines, remove all conflicting entities before placing new ones\n- Plan the layout considering the space needed for input/output inserters and chests\n- Consider the direction of inserters and available space when placing storage chests\n\n### Fluid System Issues\n- Steam engine not receiving liquid input\n- Ensure proper pipe connections between water source, boiler, and steam engine"}
