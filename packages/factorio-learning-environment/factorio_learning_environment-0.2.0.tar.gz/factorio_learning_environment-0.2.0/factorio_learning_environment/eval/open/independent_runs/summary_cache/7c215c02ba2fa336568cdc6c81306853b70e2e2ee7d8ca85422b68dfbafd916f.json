{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-10.5, 25.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at position (-10.5, 25.5)\n- Boiler at position (-14.5, 20.0)\n- Boiler at position (-11.5, 20.0)\n- Steam Engine at position (-4.5, 22.5)\n- Steam Engine at position (-1.5, 22.5)\n- Pipe connections between these entities\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Furnace at position (-14.0, -49.0)\n- Furnace at position (-12.0, -48.0)\n- Multiple Burner Inserters at positions (-13.5, -47.5), (-14.5, -45.5), (-13.5, -45.5), (-11.5, -45.5), (-9.5, -44.5), (-14.5, -43.5)\n- Wooden Chests at positions (-13.5, -46.5), (-13.5, -44.5), (-9.5, -43.5)\n- Iron Chest at position (-11.5, -44.5)\n- Belt Group connecting these entities\n\n### Pipe Network\n- PipeGroup at position (-16.5, 20.5) with fluid system 17632, carrying water\n- Additional PipeGroups at various positions for fluid transport\n\n### Electricity Network\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at multiple positions including (-9.5, -29.5), (-9.5, -37.5), (-4.5, 25.5), etc.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Connecting Offshore Pump to Boiler\n- Ensure correct placement and connection of pipes or underground pipes between the offshore pump and the boiler. Verify that the connection path is clear and the correct type of pipe is used.\n\n### Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Check that the source entities for inserters are producing or have items available for pickup. Ensure that the inserters are correctly aligned with the source entities.\n\n### Furnaces Missing Ingredients\n- Ensure that furnaces have the necessary ingredients to operate. Verify that inserters are properly supplying the required materials to the furnaces.\n\n### General Connection Issues\n- Regularly verify connections between entities to ensure they are correctly linked, especially in complex networks involving pipes and belts."}
