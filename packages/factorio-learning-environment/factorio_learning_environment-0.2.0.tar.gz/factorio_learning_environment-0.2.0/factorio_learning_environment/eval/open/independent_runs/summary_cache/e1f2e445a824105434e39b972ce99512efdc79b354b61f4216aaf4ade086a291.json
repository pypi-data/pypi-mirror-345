{"content": "Based on the execution logs, I'll generate a new report:\n\nEXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining Setup at (41.0, -82.0)\n- Burner mining drill positioned at (41.0, -82.0)\n- Two iron chests for coal storage:\n  - At (41.5, -84.5) containing 1600 coal\n  - At (41.5, -83.5) containing 797 coal\n\n### Iron Smelting System at (45.0-47.0, -81.0)\n- Two stone furnaces:\n  - Left furnace at (45.0, -81.0)\n  - Right furnace at (47.0, -81.0)\n- Input system:\n  - Wooden chest at (46.5, -83.5) for ore input\n  - Two burner inserters at (45.5, -82.5) and (47.5, -82.5) feeding furnaces\n- Additional wooden chest at (45.5, -84.5)\n\n### Belt Distribution System at (45.5-48.5, -79.5)\n- Two parallel belt lines:\n  - Left belt group: (46.5, -79.5) to (45.5, -79.5)\n  - Right belt group: (47.5, -79.5) to (48.5, -79.5)\n- Input chest at (46.5, -77.5)\n- Two burner inserters at (46.5, -78.5) and (47.5, -78.5) feeding the belts\n\n### Storage System\n- Wooden chest at (49.5, -80.5) containing 800 coal\n- Wooden chest at (49.5, -79.5) containing 50 coal and 1500 iron plates\n\nERROR TIPS\n1. Entity Placement Conflicts\n   - Before placing entities (transport belts, inserters), verify the target location is clear of other entities\n   - Multiple attempts were made to place entities at (45.5, -80.5) where other entities existed\n\n2. Inventory Management\n   - Check inventory before attempting to place entities (encountered when trying to place splitter)\n   - Keep track of burner inserter count in inventory to avoid placement failures\n\n3. Entity Configuration\n   - Ensure inserter pickup and drop positions are properly configured before changing directions\n   - Multiple reconfigurations of inserters suggest need for better initial placement planning\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nFunctions:\n- place_entity(): Places game entities, requires valid position and available inventory\n- reset_inserter(): Configures inserter direction and pickup/drop positions\n\nImportant Variables:\n- left_belt_3: TransportBelt\n- right_inserter: BurnerInserter\n- left_inserter: BurnerInserter\n- splitter: Splitter"}
