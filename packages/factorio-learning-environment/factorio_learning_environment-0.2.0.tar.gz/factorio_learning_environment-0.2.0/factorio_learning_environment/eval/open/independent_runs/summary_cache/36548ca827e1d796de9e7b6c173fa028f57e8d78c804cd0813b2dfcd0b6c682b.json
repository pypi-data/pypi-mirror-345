{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Storage Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (41.0, -82.0) with a drop position at (40.5, -83.5).\n- Wooden Chests at positions (40.5, -83.5), (41.5, -83.5), and (42.5, -83.5) for storage.\n- Transport Belt connecting the mining drill to the storage chests.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (0.0, 0.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Burner Inserter at position (1.5, 0.5) waiting for source items, connected to the stone furnace.\n- Wooden Chest at position (2.5, 0.5) as a buffer.\n- Burner Inserter at position (3.5, 0.5) waiting for source items, connected to the wooden chest.\n- Transport Belt connecting the inserters and chests.\n\n### Copper Plate Production Line\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (10.0, 0.0) with no ingredients to smelt.\n- Burner Inserter at position (11.5, 0.5) waiting for source items, connected to the stone furnace.\n- Wooden Chest at position (12.5, 0.5) storing copper plates.\n\n### Coal Storage Area\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Multiple Wooden Chests at positions (28.5, 0.5), (30.5, 0.5), (32.5, 0.5), (34.5, 0.5), (36.5, 0.5), (38.5, 0.5), and (40.5, 0.5) storing coal.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when attempting to remove a chest\n- Ensure that the correct method or function is used to remove a chest. The error indicates that the 'Chest' object is not callable, suggesting a misuse of the API.\n\n### Inserter waiting for source items\n- Verify that the inserters have access to source items. Ensure that the supply chain is not interrupted and that items are available for the inserters to pick up.\n\n### Warnings about full chests\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are full to prevent bottlenecks in production. This will allow mining drills and inserters to continue operating without interruption.\n\n### Warnings about no ingredients to smelt\n- Ensure that stone furnaces have the necessary ingredients to process. Check the supply lines to make sure raw materials are being delivered to the furnaces."}
