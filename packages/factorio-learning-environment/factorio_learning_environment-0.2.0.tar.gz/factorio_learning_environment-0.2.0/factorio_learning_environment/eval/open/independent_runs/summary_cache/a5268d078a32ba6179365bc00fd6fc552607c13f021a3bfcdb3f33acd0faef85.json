{"content": "# EXISTING STRUCTURES\n### Coal mining operation at position(x=41.0, y=-82.0)\nConsists of a burner mining drill at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0) and two wooden chests at positions (x=40.5, y=-83.5) and (x=41.5, y=-83.5) for coal storage.\n\n### Inserter system at position(x=39.5, y=-81.5)\nConsists of a burner inserter at position (x=39.5, y=-81.5) connected to the coal mining operation.\n\n### Furnace at position(x=0.0, y=0.0)\nConsists of a stone furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) with no current input or output.\n\n# ERROR TIPS\n* ### Errors when extracting from a chest\n  - Ensure the chest is not full before attempting to extract items.\n  - Check the chest's inventory before extraction to avoid errors.\n* ### Errors when inserting items into a mining drill\n  - Verify the mining drill's inventory is not full before inserting items.\n  - Check the drill's fuel source and ensure it is not full before inserting coal.\n* ### Errors due to incorrect entity retrieval\n  - Ensure the correct keyword arguments are used when retrieving entities (e.g., 'position' instead of 'positoni').\n* ### Errors when a chest at the drop position is full\n  - Empty the chest at the drop position to continue mining.\n\n# NAMESPACE\n* Important variables:\n  - `coal_chest`: a wooden chest for coal storage (type: Chest)\n  - `drill`: a burner mining drill (type: BurnerMiningDrill)\n  - `inserter`: a burner inserter (type: BurnerInserter)\n  - `furnace`: a stone furnace (type: Furnace)\n* Utility functions:\n  - `extract_item`: extracts items from a chest (invoked multiple times with varying success)\n  - `insert_item`: inserts items into a mining drill (invoked multiple times with varying success)\n  - `get_entity`: retrieves an entity by prototype and position (invoked with incorrect keyword arguments once)"}
