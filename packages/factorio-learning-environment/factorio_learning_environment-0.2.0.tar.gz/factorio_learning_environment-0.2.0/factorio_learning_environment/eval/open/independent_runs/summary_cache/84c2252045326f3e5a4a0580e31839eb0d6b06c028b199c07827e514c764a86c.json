For example, iron ore should be inserted into a furnace, not the other way around\n### Trying to craft an item without having the raw materials\n- Ensure you have the raw materials to craft an item. For example, you need stone to craft a stone furnace and wood to craft a wooden chest\n\nNAMESPACE\n```"}
