{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity generator at position(2.5, 2.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Small electric pole (position 2.5, 2.5)\n\n### Lab at position(3, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Lab (position 3, 0) which requires 10 automation science packs to complete Automation research and is currently not powered.\n\n### Copper plate mine at position(0, 0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Furnace (position 0, 0) with coal as fuel and producing iron plates.\n- Furnace (position 2, 0) with coal as fuel but currently has no ingredients to smelt.\n\n### Wooden chest at position(3.5, 0.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Wooden chest (position 3.5, 0.5) which is currently empty.\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing new poles\n- Ensure that the first argument when placing a new pole is a valid Prototype object. Double-check the object type before attempting to place it.\n\n### Errors when the lab is not powered\n- Verify that the lab is connected to a power source. Ensure that there are sufficient electric poles and that they are correctly placed to provide power.\n\n### Errors related to missing ingredients for research\n- Ensure that you have the required ingredients (in this case, 10 automation science packs) in your inventory before attempting to start research. Check your inventory and gather the necessary items.\n\n### Errors when using extracting but being too far\n- Make sure to move to the target entity where you want to extract from before extracting items.\n\n### Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity\n- Ensure you can place an entity to a tile before attempting to place it. Check the surrounding area for any existing entities that may block placement."}
