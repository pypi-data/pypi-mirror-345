{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Iron Ore Mining Section:**\n  - Burner Mining Drill at position (x=-15.0, y=-50.0) with a drop chest at (x=-14.5, y=-48.5).\n  - Iron chests at positions (x=-16.5, y=-48.5) and (x=-18.5, y=-48.5) for iron ore storage.\n  \n- **Smelting Section:**\n  - Stone Furnace at position (x=-13.0, y=-48.0) with iron ore supplied from the mining section.\n  - Stone Furnace at position (x=-11.0, y=-48.0) with iron ore supplied from the mining section.\n  - Stone Furnace at position (x=-9.0, y=-48.0) with iron ore supplied from the mining section.\n  - Iron chests at positions (x=-13.5, y=-49.5), (x=-15.5, y=-48.5), and (x=-14.5, y=-47.5) for storage of processed materials.\n\n### Coal Storage and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Coal Mining and Storage:**\n  - Burner Mining Drill at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0) with a drop chest at (x=41.5, y=-80.5).\n  - Stone Furnace at position (x=43.0, y=-82.0) for processing coal.\n  - Iron chests at positions (x=41.5, y=-80.5), (x=42.5, y=-80.5), (x=44.5, y=-80.5), (x=45.5, y=-80.5), (x=47.5, y=-80.5), and (x=49.5, y=-80.5) for coal storage.\n  - Wooden chest at position (x=41.5, y=-79.5) for additional coal storage.\n\n### Coal Distribution System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Inserters and Belts:**\n  - Burner Inserter at position (x=43.5, y=-80.5) for transferring coal between chests and furnaces.\n  - Additional burner inserters at positions (x=41.5, y=-78.5) and (x=43.5, y=-80.5) for coal distribution.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when extracting from storage\n- Ensure that the target storage entity contains the items you wish to extract. Verify the inventory of the storage entity before attempting extraction.\n\n### Errors when clearing drop chests\n- Make sure the drop chest is not full or obstructed before attempting to clear it. Ensure there is space in your inventory to receive the extracted items.\n\n### Errors when extracting iron plates from furnaces\n- Confirm that the furnace has completed smelting and contains iron plates before attempting extraction. Check the furnace status and inventory to ensure it is ready for extraction.\n\n### Errors due to full chests\n- Regularly check and empty chests that are full to prevent interruptions in mining and production processes. Ensure there is always space available for new items."}
