{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=10.5, y=34.5)\n- Consists of:\n  - Steam Engine at position (x=10.5, y=34.5)\n  - Boiler at position (x=-1.5, y=27.0)\n  - Offshore Pump at position (x=-7.5, y=25.5)\n  - Pipe network connecting the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility at Position (x=15.0, y=0.0)\n- Consists of:\n  - Stone Furnace at position (x=15.0, y=0.0)\n  - Inserters at positions (x=17.5, y=0.5) and (x=16.5, y=0.5) for moving items into and out of the furnace\n  - Wooden Chests at positions (x=5.5, y=0.5) and (x=18.5, y=0.5) for storage\n\n### Pipe Network\n- Multiple PipeGroups connecting various entities, including:\n  - PipeGroup at position (x=-14.5, y=14.5) with fluid system 13208\n  - PipeGroup at position (x=-14.5, y=17.5) with fluid system 13211, carrying water\n  - PipeGroup at position (x=1.5, y=29.5) with fluid system 13248, carrying water\n\n### Electricity Network\n- Electricity poles connecting various entities, including inserters and the steam engine, with network ID 24211\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when Placing Pipes\n- Ensure the target tile is clear of existing entities before placing a pipe. Remove any obstructions first.\n\n### Errors when Connecting Underground Pipes\n- Verify that the start and end points of underground pipes are correctly aligned and clear of obstructions before attempting to connect.\n\n### Errors Due to Lack of Inventory Items\n- Check your inventory to ensure you have the necessary items before attempting to place them in the world.\n\n### Errors in Crafting and Extracting Items\n- Use the correct equipment, such as a furnace, for crafting items that require specific processing methods.\n- Ensure the entity you are extracting from contains the desired item before attempting extraction.\n\n### Attribute Errors in Code\n- Verify that the object attributes you are trying to access exist and are correctly spelled in your code.\n\nBy addressing these errors, you can improve the efficiency and effectiveness of your operations in the game."}
