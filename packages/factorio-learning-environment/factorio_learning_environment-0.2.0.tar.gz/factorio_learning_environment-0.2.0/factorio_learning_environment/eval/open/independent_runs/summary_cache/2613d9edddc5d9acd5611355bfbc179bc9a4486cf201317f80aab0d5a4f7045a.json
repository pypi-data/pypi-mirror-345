{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n###Coal Mining Station at (-14.0, -15.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (24.0, -15.0)\n- Wooden chest at (23.5, -16.5) storing 333 coal\n\n###Iron Ore Mining Station at (-14.0, 23.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (-14.0, 23.0)\n- Wooden chest at (-14.5, 21.5) storing 286 iron ore\n\n###Copper Processing Complex at (20.0, 20.0)\nConsists of:\n- Burner mining drill at (20.0, 20.0) mining copper ore\n- Input wooden chest at (20.5, 21.5) storing 332 copper ore\n- Secondary input wooden chest at (22.5, 21.5) storing 381 copper ore\n- Stone furnace at (24.0, 20.0)\n- Output wooden chest at (24.5, 17.5) storing 53 copper plates\n- Burner inserter at (24.5, 18.5) moving items from furnace to output chest\n- Burner inserter at (22.5, 20.5) moving items from input chest to furnace\n\n###Iron Processing Station at (-10.0, 20.0)\nConsists of:\n- Two stone furnaces at (-11.0, 20.0) and (-9.0, 20.0)\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n###Incorrect inserter placement and configuration\n- The input inserter's pickup/drop positions are misaligned with the chest and furnace. The inserter at (22.5, 20.5) is trying to pick up from (21.5, 20.5) but should be picking up from the chest at (22.5, 21.5)\n- When placing inserters, ensure the pickup and drop positions align with the source and target entities\n\n###Furnace operation issues\n- Multiple furnaces are showing NO_INGREDIENTS status despite having fuel\n- Ensure proper inserter connections are established to feed materials into furnaces\n- Verify that inserters can reach both their pickup and drop positions when setting up automated smelting\n\n###Resource management\n- Some mining drills are running low on fuel (8 coal remaining)\n- Implement a fuel distribution system to keep mining drills operational\n- Monitor fuel levels in burner devices to prevent operation interruption"}
