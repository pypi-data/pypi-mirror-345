{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Transfer System at Position (-14.5, -48.5)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (-15.0, -50.0): Extracts iron ore and transfers it to the wooden chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (-14.5, -48.5): Stores extracted iron ore.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (-14.5, -46.5): Transfers iron ore from the chest to the furnace. Pickup position is (-14.5, -45.5) and drop position is (-14.5, -47.5).\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (0.0, 0.0): Intended to smelt iron ore into iron plates, currently not receiving iron ore.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Alignment Errors\n- Ensure that the inserter's pickup position is correctly aligned with the chest. Misalignment can prevent the transfer of items.\n\n### Errors When Placing Entities\n- Before placing an entity, verify that the target tile is unoccupied and suitable for placement. Adjust spacing or direction if necessary to avoid collisions with existing entities.\n\n### Inserter Setup Issues\n- Regularly check the setup of inserters to ensure they are correctly configured to transfer items between entities. Misconfigurations can lead to inefficiencies or stoppages in production lines.\n\n### Fuel Management\n- Ensure that all fuel-dependent entities, such as burner inserters and mining drills, are adequately refueled to maintain continuous operation."}
