{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Processing Facility at Position (-15.0, -50.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (-15.0, -50.0) with coal as fuel, extracting iron ore.\n- Wooden Chests at positions (-15.5, -48.5) and (-14.5, -48.5) for storing extracted iron ore.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-13.5, -48.5) transferring iron ore from chests to a stone furnace.\n\n### Iron Smelting Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace 1 at position (-12.0, -48.0) fueled with coal, smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Stone Furnace 2 at position (-10.0, -48.0) fueled with coal, smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserter at position (-14.5, -47.5) transferring iron ore from chests to furnaces.\n- Wooden Chest at position (-6.5, -48.5) storing iron plates.\n\n### Iron Plate Transfer System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Inserter at position (-8.5, -47.5) transferring iron plates from the furnace to a wooden chest.\n- Wooden Chests at positions (-6.5, -47.5) and (-7.5, -47.5) for storing and transferring iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that the inserters have access to source items by checking the supply chain and making sure that the source entities (e.g., chests or furnaces) contain the necessary items.\n\n### Errors with No Iron Plates Available in Input Chest\n- Regularly check and refill the input chests with the required items to maintain a continuous production flow.\n\n### Errors with No Iron Ore Available in Ore Chest\n- Ensure that the mining drills are functioning and that there is a consistent supply of iron ore being transferred to the ore chests.\n\n### Errors with Blocked Inserters\n- Regularly clear the destination of inserters to prevent blockages. Ensure that the destination entity (e.g., chests or furnaces) has enough space to receive items.\n\n### Errors with Missing Entities\n- Verify the existence and correct placement of entities before attempting to interact with them. Ensure that the specified positions for entities are accurate and that the entities are present on the map."}
