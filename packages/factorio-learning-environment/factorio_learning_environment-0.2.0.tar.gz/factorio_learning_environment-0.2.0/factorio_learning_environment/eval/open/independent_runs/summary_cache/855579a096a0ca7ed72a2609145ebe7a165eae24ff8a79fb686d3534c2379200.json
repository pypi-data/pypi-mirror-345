{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=5.5, y=21.5)\nConsists of:\n- Steam Engine at position (x=5.5, y=21.5)\n- Boiler at position (x=-1.5, y=24.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\n- PipeGroup connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine, with pipes at various positions including (x=-8.5, y=23.5), (x=-9.5, y=23.5), (x=-4.5, y=23.5), (x=-3.5, y=23.5), (x=-3.5, y=24.5), (x=-0.5, y=22.5), (x=1.5, y=22.5), (x=3.5, y=24.5), (x=5.5, y=24.5), and (x=4.5, y=24.5).\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Stone Furnaces at positions (x=0.0, y=0.0), (x=10.0, y=0.0), (x=13.0, y=0.0), and (x=16.0, y=0.0) for smelting iron ore into iron plates.\n- Burner Inserters at positions (x=8.5, y=0.5), (x=17.5, y=0.5), (x=19.5, y=0.5), and (x=20.5, y=0.5) for moving items between furnaces and chests.\n- Wooden Chests at positions (x=17.5, y=-0.5) and (x=19.5, y=-0.5) for storing output.\n\n### Research Lab\n- Lab at position with lab input for automation-science-pack, status indicating no research in progress.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Undefined or Incorrect Class Names\n- Ensure that the correct class names are used when checking entity types. Use fully qualified names such as `entities.Furnace` or `entities.Chest` to avoid `NameError` and `AttributeError`.\n\n### Errors When Connecting Entities\n- Verify that the entities you are trying to connect are compatible and correctly positioned. Ensure that the connection logic is correctly implemented to avoid exceptions when connecting pipes or other entities.\n\n### Errors When Placing Entities Too Far\n- Move closer to the target position before attempting to place an entity. Ensure the player is within the maximum allowable distance to place entities successfully.\n\n### Errors with Research Initiation\n- Ensure that all prerequisites for initiating research are met, including having the necessary science packs and power supply to the lab.\n\n### Errors with Steam Engine Not Working\n- Check connections and ensure that the steam engine is properly connected to the boiler and has sufficient fuel to operate."}
