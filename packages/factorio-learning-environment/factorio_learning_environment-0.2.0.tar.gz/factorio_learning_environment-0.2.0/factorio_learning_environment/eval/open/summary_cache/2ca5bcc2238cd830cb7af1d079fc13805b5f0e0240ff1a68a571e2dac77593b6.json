{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron plate production setup at position around (16.0, 71.0)\nConsists of the following connected entities forming a small iron plate production line:\n- Burner mining drill at position (16.0, 71.0), facing down, extracting iron ore\n- Stone furnace at position (16.0, 73.0), smelting iron ore into iron plates\n- Wooden chest at position (17.5, 73.5), collecting iron plates from the furnace\n- Burner inserter at position (18.5, 73.5), moving iron plates from the furnace output to the wooden chest\n\nThis structure is designed to extract iron ore, smelt it into iron plates, and collect the plates for further use.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors placing inserters next to entities due to occupied tiles\n- When placing an inserter next to a furnace or other entity, ensure the target tile is free of other entities such as chests or other inserters.\n- If placement fails due to occupied tile, try increasing the spacing parameter, changing the direction of placement, or selecting a different reference position.\n- Avoid placing multiple inserters overlapping or adjacent in the same tile space.\n\n### Inserter waiting for source items warning\n- Inserters report \"waiting for source items\" if the input inventory (e.g., furnace output) is empty.\n- Ensure that the upstream entity (e.g., furnace) has items ready to be picked up before expecting inserters to operate.\n- Check that the mining drill is outputting ore into the furnace properly to maintain continuous production.\n\n### Inserting items from inventory failing due to lack of items\n- Attempting to insert items (e.g., coal) into entities from inventory can fail if the inventory does not contain the required items.\n- Always verify inventory contents before insertion commands to avoid exceptions.\n\nNAMESPACE\n\nNo user-defined functions have been defined by the agent so far."}
