{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, -60.0) with a drop position at (4.5, -58.5). This drill is currently working and extracting iron ore into a nearby chest.\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (4.5, -58.5), (5.5, -60.5), (6.5, -60.5), (7.5, -60.5), (8.5, -60.5), and (9.5, -60.5) used for storing extracted iron ore. The chest at (4.5, -58.5) contains iron ore.\n- **Stone Furnaces** at positions (-15.0, -48.0) and (-13.0, -48.0) which are actively smelting iron ore into iron plates. Both furnaces are working and have iron ore and coal as fuel.\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-11.0, -48.0) which is not currently smelting due to a lack of ingredients.\n\n### Iron Plate Storage\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Wooden Chests** at positions (-14.5, -50.5), (-13.5, -50.5), (-12.5, -50.5), (-11.5, -50.5), (-10.5, -50.5), (-9.5, -50.5), (-8.5, -50.5), (-7.5, -50.5), and (-6.5, -50.5) used for storing iron plates. Some chests are full and contain iron plates.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Full Chests\n- Ensure that chests are emptied regularly to prevent mining drills and furnaces from halting due to full storage. The chest at (4.5, -58.5) is full, preventing further mining.\n\n### Errors with Furnaces Lacking Ingredients\n- Maintain a steady supply of raw materials to furnaces to ensure continuous operation. The furnace at (-11.0, -48.0) is inactive due to a lack of iron ore.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- **ExtractResource**: Function to extract resources from entities like chests. Ensure proximity to the target entity before extraction.\n- **InsertResource**: Function to insert resources into entities like furnaces. Ensure the target entity has capacity for the resources.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `iron_ore_chest_position: Position` - Position of the chest storing iron ore.\n- `iron_plate_furnace_positions: List[Position]` - Positions of furnaces used for smelting iron ore.\n- `iron_plate_storage_positions: List[Position]` - Positions of chests storing iron plates."}
