{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\nNo new structures have been successfully created on the map. Multiple recovery attempts targeted the Lab\u2014intended for supplying Automation Science Packs\u2014but all placement and crafting actions failed (for example, the Lab at (0.5, 2.5) was never produced due to missing inventory and sub-ingredient shortages). Although smelting operations were performed using a furnace at Position(x=5.0, y=5.0) and a copper furnace at Position(x=-27.0, y=-60.0), these machines were only retrieved from the environment for processing and were not newly built by the agent.\n\nERROR TIPS\n\u2022 Incorrect API usage for entity retrieval\n  - When calling get_entities, avoid unsupported keyword arguments (e.g. \u2018radius\u2019) and do not supply extra positional arguments. Validate the function signature before invocation.\n\u2022 Unhandled None iteration\n  - Ensure that entity-retrieval results are iterable; if get_entities returns None, convert this to an empty list prior to iterating.\n\u2022 Lab crafting failures due to resource chain gaps\n  - Confirm that all required sub-ingredients (such as iron-gear-wheels, electronic-circuits, and copper-cables) and their prerequisites (iron-plates, copper-plates, etc.) are sufficiently available and that the proper production processes (like smelting in furnaces) are in place.\n\u2022 Lab placement errors\n  - Verify that a Lab is present in the inventory before attempting placement on the map."}
