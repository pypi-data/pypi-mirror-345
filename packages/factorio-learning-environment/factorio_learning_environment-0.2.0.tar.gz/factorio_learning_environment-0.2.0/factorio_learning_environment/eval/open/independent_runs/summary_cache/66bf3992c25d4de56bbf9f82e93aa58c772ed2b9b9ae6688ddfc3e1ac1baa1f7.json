Repeated boiler placement errors (due to distance constraints and overlapping water) indicate the need for pre-checks using can_place_entity.\n\u2003\u2013 When repositioning a critical entity like a boiler, validate that the chosen site is within range and not compromised by environmental factors (such as water).\n\n\u2022 Fluid and Water Connection Issues:\n\u2003\u2013 Prior to connection attempts, ensure that a valid path exists between the current player position and the water source to prevent pathfinding failures.\n\u2003\u2013 Verify that both connection endpoints have clear, unobstructed access and that sufficient pipe inventory is available.\n\u2003\u2013 Double-check intermediate connection points for blockages during fluid link reattempts.\n\n\u2022 Entity Retrieval and Repositioning:\n\u2003\u2013 After picking up an entity for repositioning, incorporate checks to confirm the entity has been successfully removed from the map before attempting to place it from the inventory.\n\u2003\u2013 Address retrieval failures by validating that the entity is present at its expected position before proceeding with further operations.\n\n\u2022 General Resource and Network Stabilization:\n\u2003\u2013 Monitor inventory levels and allow sufficient stabilization time between connection attempts to avoid cascading errors related to fluid or water linking.\n\u2003\u2013 Continue leveraging prior mitigation strategies for pipe crafting and resource management when facing connection reattempt errors."}
