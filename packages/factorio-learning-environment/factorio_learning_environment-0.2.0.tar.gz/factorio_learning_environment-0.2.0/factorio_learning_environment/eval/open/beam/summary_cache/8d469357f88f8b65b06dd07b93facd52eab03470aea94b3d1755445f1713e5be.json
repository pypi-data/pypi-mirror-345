{"content": "I notice we have several issues to address:\n\n1. Mining drill at (-11.0, 25.0) has no fuel\n2. Mining drill at (-15.0, 23.0) is waiting for space in destination\n3. Belt systems need proper connections\n\nLet's fix the no-fuel situation first:\n\n```python\n# Check inventory\ninventory = inspect_inventory()\nprint(f\"Current inventory: {inventory}\")\n\n# Add fuel to the mining drill that's out of fuel\nmove_to(Position(x=-11.0, y=25.0))\ninsert_item(Prototype.Coal, Position(x=-11.0, y=25.0), quantity=5)\nprint(\"Added fuel to mining drill\")\n\n# Now let's check if we need to add any connecting belts\n# We need to ensure the output from the mining drill can reach the furnace\nmove_to(Position(x=-11.5, y=26.5))\n\n# Add connecting belts\nbelt_positions = [\n    Position(x=-11.5, y=26.5),  # Start position\n    Position(x=-11.5, y=27.5),  # Moving down\n    Position(x=-11.5, y=28.5)   # Connect to furnace input\n]\n\nfor pos in belt_positions:\n    move_to(pos)\n    belt = place_entity(\n        Prototype.TransportBelt,\n        position=pos,\n        direction=Direction.DOWN,\n        exact=True\n    )\n    if belt:\n        print(f\"Placed transport belt at {pos}\")\n\n# Verify our setup\nprint(f\"Updated inventory: {inspect_inventory()}\")\nprint(f\"Current entities: {get_entities()}\")\n\n# Check mining drill status after changes\ndrill = get_entity(Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill, Position(x=-11.0, y=25.0))\nif drill:\n    print(f\"Mining drill status: {drill.status}\")\n```\n\nThis should:\n1. Add fuel to the mining drill that's out of fuel\n2. Add connecting belts to ensure proper item flow\n3. Verify the setup is working correctly\n\nLet me know if you need any adjustments to this solution.", "summary_range": "[1-640]"}
