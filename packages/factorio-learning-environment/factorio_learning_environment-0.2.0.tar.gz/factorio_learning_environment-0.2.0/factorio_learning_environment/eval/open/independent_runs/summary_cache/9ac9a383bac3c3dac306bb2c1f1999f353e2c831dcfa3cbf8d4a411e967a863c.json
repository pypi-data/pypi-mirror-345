{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Ore Mining and Processing Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (4.0, y=-60.0)\n  - Status: Out of fuel, chest at drop position is full.\n  - Drop position: (4.5, y=-58.5)\n- **Wooden Chests** for storage:\n  - Chest at position (4.5, y=-58.5) with inventory: {'iron-ore': 1}\n  - Additional chests at positions (5.5, y=-60.5), (7.5, y=-60.5), (6.5, y=-60.5), (9.5, y=-60.5), (8.5, y=-60.5), and (-14.5, y=-50.5) with empty inventories.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- **Stone Furnaces** for smelting iron ore:\n  - Furnace at position (-15.0, y=-48.0)\n    - Fuel: {'coal': 42}\n    - Status: Working\n    - Source inventory: {'iron-ore': 4}\n    - Result inventory: {'iron-plate': 7}\n  - Furnace at position (-13.0, y=-48.0)\n    - Fuel: {'coal': 48}\n    - Status: Working\n    - Source inventory: {}\n    - Result inventory: {'iron-plate': 23}\n  - Furnace at position (-11.0, y=-48.0)\n    - Fuel: {'coal': 50}\n    - Status: No ingredients\n    - Warnings: No ingredients to smelt, furnace fuel source is full.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors related to fuel management\n- Ensure that the burner mining drill is refueled to continue mining operations. Check the fuel levels regularly and replenish as necessary to avoid interruptions.\n\n### Errors related to inventory management\n- Regularly check and empty the chest at the drop position of the mining drill to prevent it from becoming full and halting mining operations.\n\n### Errors related to furnace operations\n- Ensure that all furnaces have sufficient ingredients to smelt. Regularly supply iron ore to prevent furnaces from idling due to lack of ingredients.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the provided steps.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `iron_ore_count: int` - Tracks the number of iron ore extracted and inserted into furnaces.\n- `iron_plate_count: int` - Tracks the number of iron plates extracted from furnaces.\n- `coal_count: int` - Tracks the coal inventory used for fueling furnaces."}
