{"content": "The error indicates that I am still unable to craft Iron Gear Wheels because the required Iron Plates are not available. This suggests that the Stone Furnace is not producing Iron Plates, likely due to insufficient inputs or fuel.\n\nTo resolve this, I will take the following steps:\n\n1. **Verify Resource Availability**: Ensure that the Furnace has enough Iron Ore and Coal.\n2. **Gather Resources**: If the Furnace is lacking inputs, I will gather more Iron Ore and Coal.\n3. **Insert Resources into the Furnace**: Make sure the Furnace has the necessary materials to operate.\n4. **Wait for Iron Plates**: Allow the Furnace time to produce the required Iron Plates.\n5. **Craft Iron Gear Wheels**: Once I have enough Iron Plates, I will craft the Iron Gear Wheels.\n\nLet's implement these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Verify Resource Availability\nI'll check the inventory of the Stone Furnace to see how many Iron Ore and Coal are currently present.\n\n```python\nfurnace_inventory = inspect_inventory(furnace_entity)\ncurrent_iron_ore = furnace_inventory[Prototype.IronOre]\ncurrent_coal = furnace_inventory[Prototype.Coal]\ncurrent_iron_plates = furnace_inventory[Prototype.IronPlate]\n\nprint(f\"Current Iron Ore in Furnace: {current_iron_ore}\")\nprint(f\"Current Coal in Furnace: {current_coal}\")\nprint(f\"Current Iron Plates produced: {current_iron_plates}\")\n```\n\n### Step 2: Gather Resources\nIf the Furnace does not have enough Iron Ore or Coal, I will gather more from their respective resource patches.\n\n```python\nif current_iron_ore < 5:  # Assuming we need at least 5 Iron Ore\n    move_to(iron_ore_position)\n    harvest_resource(iron_ore_position, quantity=10)  # Gather more Iron Ore\n\nif current_coal < 5:  # Assuming we need at least 5 Coal\n    move_to(coal_position)\n    harvest_resource(coal_position, quantity=10)  # Gather more Coal\n```\n\n### Step 3: Insert Resources into the Furnace\nAfter gathering, I will insert the resources into the Furnace.\n\n```python\ninsert_item(Prototype.IronOre, furnace_entity, quantity=5 - current_iron_ore)\ninsert_item(Prototype.Coal, furnace_entity, quantity=5 - current_coal)\n```\n\n### Step 4: Wait for Iron Plates\nI will wait for the Furnace to produce Iron Plates.\n\n```python\nfor _ in range(30):  # Wait for a maximum of 30 seconds\n    current_iron_plates = inspect_inventory(furnace_entity)[Prototype.IronPlate]\n    if current_iron_plates >= 3:  # Need at least 3 Iron Plates\n        break\n    sleep(1)\nelse:\n    raise Exception(\"Furnace timeout - check if the furnace has fuel and iron ore.\")\n```\n\n### Step 5: Craft Iron Gear Wheels\nOnce I have enough Iron Plates, I will proceed to craft the Iron Gear Wheels.\n\n```python\nif current_iron_plates >= 3:\n    extract_item(Prototype.IronPlate, furnace_entity.position, quantity=3)\nelse:\n    raise Exception(\"Not enough Iron Plates available to extract.\")\n\nfor _ in range(2):  # I need 2 Iron Gear Wheels\n    craft_item(Prototype.IronGearWheel)\n\n# Verify if the crafting was successful\nassert inspect_inventory()[Prototype.IronGearWheel] >= 2, \"Failed to craft 2 Iron Gear Wheels.\"\n```\n\n### Final Steps\nAfter crafting the Iron Gear Wheels, I will continue with crafting the Burner Mining Drill and placing it.\n\n```python\ndrill_quantity = craft_item(Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill)\nassert drill_quantity == 1, f\"Expected to craft 1 Burner Mining Drill, but crafted {drill_quantity}\"\n\ndrill_entity = place_entity_next_to(Prototype.BurnerMiningDrill, furnace_entity.position, Direction.RIGHT)\nassert drill_entity, \"Failed to place the Burner Mining Drill.\"\n\n# Insert coal into the drill\ninsert_item(Prototype.Coal, drill_entity, quantity=5)\n```\n\n### Summary\nBy following these steps, I will ensure that the Furnace has the necessary resources to produce Iron Plates, allowing me to craft the Iron Gear Wheels and complete the setup. Let's execute these steps in sequence now.", "summary_range": "[1-28]"}
