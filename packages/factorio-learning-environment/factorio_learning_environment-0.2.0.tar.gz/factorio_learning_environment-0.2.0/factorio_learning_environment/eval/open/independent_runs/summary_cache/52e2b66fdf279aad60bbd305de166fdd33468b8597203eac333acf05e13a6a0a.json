{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (x=0.5, y=23.0)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore Pump at Position (x=-9.5, y=24.5)\n- Boiler at Position (x=0.5, y=23.0)\n- Steam Engine at Position (x=7.5, y=23.5)\n- Pipe connections between the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine\n\n### Pipe Network\n- PipeGroup connecting various entities, including the boiler and steam engine, with fluid system ID 33413.\n- PipeGroup with fluid system ID 33403, currently empty.\n\n### Electricity Network\n- ElectricityGroup with poles at various positions, including (x=14.5, y=20.5), (x=35.5, y=20.5), etc., but not connected to the power network.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors in Connecting Pipes\n- Ensure that all pipes are correctly aligned and connected between the offshore pump, boiler, and steam engine. Misalignment or missing connections will prevent fluid flow.\n- Verify that the pipe network is complete and that there are no missing or misplaced pipes that could disrupt the connection.\n\n### Errors with Steam Engine Connection\n- The steam engine is not connected to the electric network. Ensure that the steam engine is properly connected to the electricity network to generate power.\n\n### Fuel Management Errors\n- Ensure that there is sufficient fuel in the inventory before attempting to insert it into the boiler. Running out of fuel will halt operations.\n\n### Inventory Management\n- Regularly check inventory levels to ensure sufficient resources are available for operations, particularly coal for fueling boilers.\n\n## NAMESPACE\n\n### Utility Functions\n- `insert_item`: Used to insert items into entities. Ensure that the item exists in the inventory before attempting to insert.\n\n### Important Variables\n- `boiler`: Represents the boiler entity, used in fuel insertion operations.\n- `coal`: Represents the quantity of coal in the inventory, crucial for fueling operations."}
