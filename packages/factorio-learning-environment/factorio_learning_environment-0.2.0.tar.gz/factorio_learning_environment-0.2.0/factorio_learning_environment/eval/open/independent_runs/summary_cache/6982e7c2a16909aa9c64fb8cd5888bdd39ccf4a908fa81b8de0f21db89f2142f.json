{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-5.5, 24.0)\nConsists of:\n- **Steam Engine** at position (-1.5, 24.5)\n- **Boiler** at position (-5.5, 24.0)\n- **Offshore Pump** at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- **Pipe Group** connecting the offshore pump to the boiler and steam engine, with multiple pipe segments including positions (-9.5, 23.5), (-8.5, 23.5), and others.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- **Furnace** at position (6.0, -62.0) fueled by coal and processing iron ore into iron plates.\n- **Inserter** at position (6.5, -60.5) responsible for moving items between entities, currently not receiving electricity.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (6.5, -59.5) storing produced iron plates and copper plates.\n\n### Research Lab\n- **Lab** with no research in progress, requiring automation science packs for operation.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that inserters have a source of items to pick up. Verify that the source entity is correctly positioned and operational to supply items to the inserter.\n\n### Inserter Not Receiving Electricity\n- Check the connection between inserters and the power network. Ensure that all necessary poles and connections are in place to supply electricity to the inserter.\n\n### Boiler Out of Fuel\n- Regularly check and refuel boilers to maintain continuous operation. Ensure a steady supply of fuel to prevent interruptions in the electricity generation process.\n\n### Steam Engine Not Connected to Power Network\n- Verify that the steam engine is properly connected to the power network. Ensure all necessary connections and poles are in place to distribute generated electricity effectively."}
