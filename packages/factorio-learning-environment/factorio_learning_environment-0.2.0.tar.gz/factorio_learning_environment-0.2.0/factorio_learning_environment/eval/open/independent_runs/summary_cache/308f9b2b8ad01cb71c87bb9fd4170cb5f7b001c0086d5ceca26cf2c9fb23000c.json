{"content": "# Factorio Agent Report\n\n## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Power Generation System (partial)\n- **Offshore pump** at (-9.5, -2.5) facing RIGHT\n- **Boiler** at (3.5, 0.0) facing UP (contains 48 coal)\n- **Steam engine** at (6.5, 0.5) facing UP\n- **Pipe network** connecting offshore pump to boiler (fluid system 250)\n- **Additional pipe networks** (fluid systems 256 and 257) not currently connected to main system\n\nNote: The power generation system is not fully operational as the boiler and steam engine are not properly connected despite multiple connection attempts.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Fluid connection issues\n- Ensure boilers and steam engines are properly aligned (boiler steam output must face steam engine input)\n- Verify pipe connections are complete before testing power generation\n- Check that all connection points are unobstructed before attempting to connect entities\n\n### Power generation troubleshooting\n- Confirm water is reaching the boiler before expecting steam production\n- Ensure coal is properly inserted into the boiler's fuel inventory\n- Verify steam pipes are correctly connected between boiler output and steam engine input\n\n### General placement errors\n- Double-check entity rotation before placement to ensure proper connection points\n- Maintain proper spacing between entities to allow for pipe connections\n- Verify fluid systems are properly connected before testing functionality\n\n### Repeated connection attempts\n- Multiple attempts to connect boiler to steam engine failed due to:\n  - Incorrect rotation/orientation\n  - Blocked connection points\n  - Incomplete pipe networks\n  - Mismatched fluid expectations (water vs steam)"}
