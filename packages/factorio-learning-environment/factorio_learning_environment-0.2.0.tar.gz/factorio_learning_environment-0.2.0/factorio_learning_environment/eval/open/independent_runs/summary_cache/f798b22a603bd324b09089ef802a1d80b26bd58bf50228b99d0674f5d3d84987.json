{"content": "### EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n#### Burner Mining Drill Setup at position (41.0, -86.0)\n- **Burner Mining Drill** at position (41.0, -86.0): Extracts coal from the resource patch.\n- **Transport Belt** at position (41.5, -84.5): Transports extracted coal from the drill.\n- **Burner Inserter** at position (41.5, -83.5): Moves coal from the transport belt to the chest.\n- **Wooden Chest** at position (41.5, -79.5): Stores the coal transported by the inserter.\n\n#### Stone Furnace at position (-13.0, -50.0)\n- **Stone Furnace** at position (-13.0, -50.0): Used for smelting ores into plates. Currently idle due to lack of ingredients.\n\n---\n\n### ERROR TIPS\n\n#### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Ensure the target tile is clear before placing entities like **wooden chests**, **burner inserters**, or **transport belts**. Repeated attempts to place entities on occupied tiles caused multiple errors.\n- Use `clear_entity` or similar commands to remove existing entities before placing new ones.\n\n#### Errors when inspecting non-existent entities\n- Verify that the entity exists at the specified position before attempting to inspect its inventory. Errors occurred when trying to inspect a chest that was not present or had been removed.\n\n#### Errors when placing entities without clearing existing ones\n- Always check for existing entities at the target position before placing new ones. For example, placing a **burner inserter** at (41.5, -83.5) failed multiple times because the position was already occupied.\n\n#### Errors when fetching non-existent entities\n- Ensure the entity exists at the specified position before attempting to fetch it. Errors occurred when trying to fetch a **transport belt** or **wooden chest** that was not present.\n\n#### General Tips\n- Double-check positions and entity states before performing actions like placing, inspecting, or fetching entities.\n- Use logging or debugging tools to verify the state of the map and entities before executing commands."}
