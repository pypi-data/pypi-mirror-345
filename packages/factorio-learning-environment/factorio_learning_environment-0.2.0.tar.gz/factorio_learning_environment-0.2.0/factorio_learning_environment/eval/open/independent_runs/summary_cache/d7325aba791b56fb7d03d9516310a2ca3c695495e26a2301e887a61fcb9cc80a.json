The drill cannot operate without fuel.\n\n- **Errors when extracting items from the Wooden Chest**\n  - Make sure the Wooden Chest is not full before attempting to extract items. The chest at position (-14.5, -48.5) is currently full, which prevents further extraction of iron ore.\n\n- **Errors when placing into a tile which is occupied by another entity**\n  - Ensure you can place an entity on a tile before attempting to place it. \n\n### NAMESPACE\n\n- **Utility Functions Defined:**\n  - No utility functions have been defined or invoked in the current execution steps.\n\n- **Important Variables Assigned:**\n  - `iron_ore: int` - Total count of iron ore in inventory (3157)\n  - `wood: int` - Total count of wood in inventory (4)\n  - `iron_plate: int` - Total count of iron plates in inventory (100)\n  - `coal: int` - Total count of coal in inventory (48)"}
