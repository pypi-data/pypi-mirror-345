{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Electricity Generator at Position (-7.0, 23.5)\nConsists of:\n- Boiler at position (-7.0, 23.5)\n- Steam engine at position (-3.5, 23.5)\n- Offshore pump at position (-9.5, 24.5)\n- Pipe group connecting these entities\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of:\n- Furnace 1 at position (-14.0, -49.0)\n- Furnace 2 at position (-12.0, -48.0)\n- Burner inserters at positions (-13.5, -47.5), (-14.5, -45.5), (-13.5, -45.5), (-11.5, -45.5), (-9.5, -44.5), (-14.5, -43.5)\n- Wooden chests at positions (-13.5, -46.5), (-13.5, -44.5), (-9.5, -43.5)\n- Iron chest at position (-11.5, -44.5)\n- Belt group connecting the furnaces, chests, and inserters\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors Due to Full Inventory\n- Ensure there is enough space in the inventory before attempting to harvest resources.\n\n### Errors When Placing Entities Too Far\n- Move closer to the target position before placing an entity to ensure it is within the allowable distance.\n\n### Errors When Inserting Items Without Inventory\n- Verify that the required items are available in the inventory before attempting to insert them into another entity.\n\n### Inserter Waiting for Source Items\n- Check the supply chain to ensure that source items are available for inserters to function properly. Ensure that the connected entities are correctly aligned and supplied with the necessary resources.\n\n### Inserter Out of Fuel\n- Regularly check and refuel inserters to prevent them from running out of fuel and stopping operations.\n\n### Output Blocked by Item on the Ground\n- Ensure there is a sink entity in place to accept the output from inserters to avoid blockage."}
