{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at positions (-14.0, -49.0) and (-12.0, -48.0)\n- Burner Inserters at positions (-13.5, -47.5), (-14.5, -45.5), (-13.5, -45.5), and (-11.5, -45.5)\n- Wooden Chests at positions (-13.5, -46.5), (-13.5, -44.5), (-9.5, -43.5), and (-7.5, -43.5)\n- Iron Chest at position (-11.5, -44.5)\n- Transport Belts connecting various entities\n\n### Electricity Generation Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Boilers at positions (1.5, 18.0), (-9.5, 22.0), (-3.5, 22.0), and (0.5, 22.0)\n- Offshore Pump at position (-10.5, 25.5)\n- Pipe Groups connecting the boilers and pump\n\n### Pipe Network\nConsists of multiple Pipe Groups at various positions, including:\n- PipeGroup at position (-6.5, 1.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (-4.5, 0.5)\n- PipeGroup at position (-2.5, 3.5)\n- Additional PipeGroups throughout the map\n\n### Electricity Distribution Network\nConsists of ElectricityGroup with poles at positions such as (-9.5, -33.5), (-9.5, -21.5), and others\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors when placing entities on occupied tiles\n- Ensure that the target tile is free of other entities before attempting to place a new entity. This will prevent errors related to placement conflicts.\n\n### Errors due to insufficient inventory\n- Verify that the required items are available in the inventory before attempting to place entities. This will avoid errors related to missing items.\n\n### Errors when using incorrect attribute names\n- Double-check the attribute names when accessing or calling them in the code. Ensure they match the expected names to avoid AttributeErrors.\n\n### Errors when placing entities on unsuitable terrain\n- Ensure that the terrain is suitable for the entity being placed. For example, pipes cannot be placed where they overlap water. Select a different location to avoid this error."}
