{"content": "## EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Coal Mining and Distribution System at Position (x=41.0, y=-82.0)\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Burner Mining Drill at position (x=41.0, y=-82.0) extracting coal.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=41.5, y=-83.5) transferring coal from the mining drill to a wooden chest.\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=40.5, y=-83.5) and another at position (x=42.5, y=-83.5) for coal storage.\n- Burner Inserter at position (x=41.5, y=-80.5) transferring coal to another wooden chest at position (x=41.5, y=-79.5).\n- Wooden Chest at position (x=41.5, y=-79.5) storing coal.\n\n### Iron Plate Production Facility\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=0.0, y=0.0) fueled with coal, processing iron ore into iron plates.\n- Stone Furnace at position (x=2.0, y=0.0) fueled with coal, processing iron ore into iron plates.\n\n### Coal Transportation System\nConsists of the following entities:\n- Belt Group with inputs at position (x=42.5, y=-83.5) and outputs at position (x=45.5, y=-83.5), transporting coal.\n\n## ERROR TIPS\n\n### Errors with Inserters Waiting for Source Items\n- Ensure that inserters have access to source items. Check that the source entity is producing or has items available for the inserter to pick up.\n\n### Errors with Fuel Management\n- Regularly check and refuel entities like burner mining drills and furnaces to maintain continuous operation. Ensure that fuel is adequately distributed to all necessary entities.\n\n### Errors with Inventory Management\n- Monitor the inventory levels of chests and furnaces to prevent bottlenecks or overflows, ensuring efficient resource flow throughout the system."}
