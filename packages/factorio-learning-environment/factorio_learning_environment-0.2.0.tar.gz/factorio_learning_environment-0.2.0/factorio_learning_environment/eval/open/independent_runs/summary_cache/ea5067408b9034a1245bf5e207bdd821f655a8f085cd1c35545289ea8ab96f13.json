{"content": "EXISTING STRUCTURES\n\n### Iron Plate Production Line (Position x=1-3, y=1-3.5)\nConsists of:\n- Two stone furnaces at positions (1,1) and (3,1)\n- Two burner inserters at positions (1.5,2.5) and (3.5,2.5)\n- Two wooden chests storing iron plates at positions (1.5,3.5) and (3.5,3.5)\nCurrent status: Furnaces idle with no ingredients, chests contain 56 and 50 iron plates respectively\n\n### Additional Storage (Position x=5.5, y=2.5-3.5)\nConsists of:\n- One wooden chest at position (5.5,3.5)\n- One burner inserter at position (5.5,2.5)\nCurrent status: Chest is empty\n\n### Copper Plate Production Line (Position x=2-4.5, y=7-9.5)\nConsists of:\n- Two stone furnaces at positions (2,7) and (4,7)\n- Two burner inserters at positions (2.5,8.5) and (4.5,8.5)\n- Two wooden chests storing copper plates at positions (2.5,9.5) and (4.5,9.5)\nCurrent status: Furnaces idle with no ingredients, chests contain 53 and 84 copper plates respectively\n\n### Power Generation System (Position x=2.5-13.5, y=33.5-37.5)\nConsists of:\n- Offshore pump at position (2.5,35.5)\n- Pipe network connecting pump to boiler\n- Boiler at position (7,35.5)\n- Steam engine at position (13.5,35.5)\n- Electric pole network connecting from (0.5,22.5) to (13.5,33.5)\nCurrent status: System partially operational, boiler needs fuel\n\n### Unused Structures\n- Offshore pump at position (-5.5,26.5) - not connected to any system\n- Lab (position not specified) - currently inactive with no research in progress\n\nERROR TIPS\n\n### Technology Research Errors\n- Research automation technology before attempting to craft items that require it (like assembling machine 1)\n- Ensure you have the necessary science packs before starting research\n\n### Crafting System Errors\n- Some items (like iron plates) cannot be crafted directly and require proper production facilities (furnaces)\n- When crafting complex items, ensure all prerequisites are available:\n  - Check if the recipe is unlocked through technology\n  - Verify you have all required ingredients\n  - Use appropriate crafting facilities for items that cannot be hand-crafted\n\n### Power System Issues\n- Keep boilers fueled to maintain power generation\n- Ensure proper fluid connections between power system components"}
