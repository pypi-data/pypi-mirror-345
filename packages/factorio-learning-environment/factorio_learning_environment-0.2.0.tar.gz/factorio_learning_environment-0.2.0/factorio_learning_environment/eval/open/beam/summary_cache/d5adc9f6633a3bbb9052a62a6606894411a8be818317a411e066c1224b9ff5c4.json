It still holds **7 pieces of copper plates** as output and **3 pieces of coal** as fuel.\n\n### Next Steps:\n1. **Insert Iron Ore into the Furnace**: Now that I have iron ore, I can insert a portion of it into the furnace to start smelting into iron plates.\n2. **Monitor Smelting Process**: After inserting the iron ore, I will need to monitor the furnace to ensure it produces enough iron plates for crafting the Assembling Machine.\n\nLet's insert **5 pieces of iron ore** into the furnace for smelting.\n\"\"\"\n\n# Insert 5 pieces of iron ore into the furnace for smelting into iron plates\ninsert_item(Prototype.IronOre, new_furnace, quantity=5)\n\n# Check the status of the furnace after inserting iron ore\nfurnace_inventory_after_insertion = inspect_inventory(new_furnace)\nprint(f\"Furnace inventory after inserting iron ore: {furnace_inventory_after_insertion}\")  # Check furnace contents\nprint(f\"Current overall inventory after all actions: {inspect_inventory()}\")  # Check overall inventory again\nprint(f\"Entities on the map: {get_entities()}\")  # Verify entity states.", "summary_range": "[1-242]"}
